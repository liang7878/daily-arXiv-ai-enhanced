### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究部落中的自主智能体如何通过通信信号协调活动、提升效率，探讨文化自组织、通信策略影响及信号作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自主智能体组织成部落时，利用通信信号协调活动并提高集体效率的机制，以及文化在其中的形成和影响。

Method: 使用NEC - DAC系统，每个智能体配备神经网络进行决策，分析不同社会结构。

Result: 发现合作文化显著影响部落表现，信号促进文化出现和代际传递，还研究了智能体神经网络内协调行为和信号的好处。

Conclusion: 合作文化对部落性能有重要影响，通信信号在文化形成、传递及智能体行为协调中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出新零和博弈评估大语言模型（LLMs）战略随机化能力，发现强弱模型表现不同，强模型面对不同对手策略有变化，指出LLMs推理和学习能力有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略随机化在LLMs中研究不足，以往工作常混淆随机化的认知决策和随机性的机械生成，导致评估不完整。

Method: 提出受田忌赛马启发的零和博弈，对五种LLMs采用不同提示风格，用系统提供随机选择的多轮竞赛游戏评估，隔离随机化决策。

Result: 弱模型不受提示影响保持确定性，强模型在明确提示下增加随机化；强模型面对弱模型采用确定性策略，面对同类对手趋向均衡策略。

Conclusion: LLMs战略推理能力有显著差异，在抽象推理和自适应学习方面有提升机会，代码开源保证可复现性。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文反驳Shojaee等人认为大推理模型存在推理悬崖是CoT推理内在局限的观点，指出是评估范式的系统级约束所致，通过实验证明模型借助工具可解决难题，还揭示了代理推理层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳Shojaee等人关于大推理模型推理悬崖是CoT推理内在局限的结论，重新解读模型性能崩溃的原因。

Method: 指出静态文本评估范式存在的系统级约束问题，通过实验展示模型借助代理工具解决难题并揭示代理推理层次。

Result: 模型在受限文本生成时无法解决问题，借助代理工具不仅能解决，还能处理远超推理悬崖复杂度的问题，且发现代理推理层次。

Conclusion: 大推理模型的思考错觉并非推理缺陷，而是有能力但缺乏行动工具的结果。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个由概率智能体通过结构化竞争和信念修正演化的人工智能系统框架，给出相关定理，表明可验证知识源于对抗性认知压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个数学严谨的人工智能系统框架，使可验证知识从对抗性认知压力中产生。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理、测度论和种群动力学，定义智能体适应性；智能体在离散时间环境中竞争，通过观察结果调整后验信念；使用基于哈希的加密身份承诺确保可追溯性和do - calculus进行因果推理；给出收敛性、鲁棒性和进化稳定性的形式定理。

Result: 系统将真理确立为进化吸引子。

Conclusion: 可验证知识能从可计算、自我调节的群体中的对抗性认知压力中产生。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [5] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将基础模型TabPFN应用于南非次国家级作物产量预测，对比多种模型，TabPFN与ML模型精度相当，但调优快、特征工程需求少，更适合实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型TabPFN在南非次国家级作物产量预测中的应用，并对比其与传统机器学习模型及基线模型的性能。

Method: 使用旬度地球观测和网格化天气数据进行次国家级夏季作物产量预测，将TabPFN与六种ML模型和三种基线模型进行对比，采用留一法交叉验证。

Result: TabPFN和ML模型精度相当，均优于基线模型，且TabPFN调优时间显著更短，特征工程需求降低。

Conclusion: TabPFN因效率高和易实现，更适合实际作物产量预测应用。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [6] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估大语言模型玩2D解谜游戏Baba is You的能力，发现大模型表现更好，微调可改善关卡分析但对求解帮助不大，推理动态规则变化对模型仍困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在语言任务表现好但推理任务有困难，游戏规则操作依赖语言和推理能力，以此作为挑战评估模型。

Method: 使用不同提示类型评估六个大语言模型，对两个模型用游戏文本和结构数据进行微调。

Result: 大模型在推理和解谜表现更好，小的未调整模型难识别游戏机制或应用规则变化，微调改善关卡分析但未显著提升求解能力。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进和微调的大语言模型，推理动态规则变化仍困难，研究为模型应用和测试提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [7] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出结合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT - 4o的新框架GITes，对比12个模型并提出新评估指标，最佳模型多项指标提升，需现实验证，成果将公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统干预肤浅，未满足深层情感需求，需结合精神智慧提升情感福祉。

Method: 引入GITes数据集，用GPT - 4o生成精神引导回复并经专家评估；对比12个模型；提出精神洞察指标并用基于思维链提示的LLM评估。

Result: 最佳模型Phi3 - Mini 3.2B Instruct在多项指标上提升，如ROUGE提升122.71%等。

Conclusion: 富含精神引导的AI系统有潜力提升用户满意度和支持效果，但需现实验证，代码和数据集将公开促进研究。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于粒度球的多粒度图粗化方法GBGC，提升粗化结果与效率，处理速度大幅提升且复杂度低，有潜力成标准预处理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往图粗化工作多基于谱保持视角，忽略图的多粒度特性，本文结合多粒度特征以生成最优粒度的粗化图。

Method: 提出基于粒度球的多粒度、高效、自适应粗化方法GBGC，引入自适应粒度球图细化机制，将原图从粗到细拆分为不同大小和最优粒度的粒度球并构建粗化图。

Result: 与其他方法相比，GBGC处理速度提升数十到数百倍，时间复杂度更低，因粒度球计算的鲁棒性和泛化性，准确率常高于原图。

Conclusion: GBGC有潜力成为标准的图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出RecLLM - R1推荐框架，结合LLM和DeepSeek R1方法，经数据构造和两阶段训练，在真实数据集上表现超基线方法，缓解过滤气泡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统存在的“过滤气泡”、外部知识利用不足、模型优化与业务策略迭代脱节等问题。

Method: 引入RecLLM - R1框架，通过数据构造将信息转为自然语言提示，采用两阶段训练：先监督微调赋予基本推荐能力，后用带思维链机制的强化学习技术进行多步推理和整体决策。

Result: 在大规模社交媒体平台的真实用户行为数据集上，RecLLM - R1在准确性、多样性和新颖性等评估指标上显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: RecLLM - R1有效缓解过滤气泡效应，为复杂业务目标下推荐模型和策略的集成优化提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章探讨将情绪检测融入日历应用，评估两种情绪检测方法，发现基于计算机活动的方法更优，GRU网络在生物识别方法中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将情绪检测融入日历应用，使界面能动态响应，提高用户生产力和参与度。

Method: 提出两种情绪检测方法，一是基于生物特征，用LSTM和GRU处理心率数据预测情绪维度；二是行为方法，用机器学习模型分析计算机活动分类情绪。

Result: 两种方法都有效，基于计算机活动的方法更稳定准确，鼠标相关交互达约90%准确率，GRU网络在生物识别方法中优于LSTM，效价预测达84.38%准确率。

Conclusion: 基于计算机活动的情绪检测方法效果更好，GRU网络在生物特征方法中有优势。

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出增量自动化数据整理管道扩展软件工程数据集，微调Skywork - SWE模型有数据缩放现象，模型在基准测试达新SOTA，发布模型检查点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程数据整理耗时，现有数据集规模和多样性有限，需新方法扩展数据集。

Method: 提出增量、自动化数据整理管道，构建含10169个Python任务实例的数据集。

Result: 模型性能随数据量增加提升，Skywork - SWE模型在SWE - bench Verified基准测试达38.0% pass@1准确率，结合技术后达47.0%。

Conclusion: 验证了数据规模对提升大语言模型软件工程能力的作用，新模型性能优，发布检查点推动研究。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

TL;DR: 提出FEAT框架生成教师反馈，构建三种数据集，少量DM融入DG效果更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI辅导系统需高质量大规模教师反馈数据，手动生成耗时且成本高

Method: 提出FEAT框架，构建DM、DG、DA三种互补数据集

Result: 将5 - 10%的DM融入DG比单独使用100% DM性能更优

Conclusion: FEAT框架和数据集构建方法能有效解决教师反馈数据生成的成本问题

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Conclusion: 结合机器学习程序内容生成与基于搜索的修复方法作为混合程序内容生成方法很有前景。

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

*Ziqi Zhu,Tao Hu,Honglong Zhang,Dan Yang,HanGeng Chen,Mengran Zhang,Xilun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CID - GraphRAG框架，解决多轮客服对话中上下文连贯和目标导向问题，实验显示其优于基线系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以保持上下文连贯和目标导向进展的局限。

Method: 从目标达成的历史对话构建动态意图转换图，实现双检索机制，平衡基于意图的图遍历和语义搜索。

Result: 在真实客服对话实验中，CID - GraphRAG在各项评估指标上显著优于语义和意图基线系统，如BLEU提升11%等。

Conclusion: 意图转换结构与语义检索结合有协同效应，CID - GraphRAG是解决知识密集型多轮对话挑战的有效框架。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以对象为中心的表示方法多仅在场景分解上评估，缺少对学习表示的推理评估，而机器人操作任务是评估其潜力的理想场景。

Method: 创建模拟环境中的多个机器人操作任务，对一个经典以对象为中心的方法在多种泛化场景下评估，并与几种最先进的整体表示方法比较。

Result: 现有方法在复杂场景易失败，以对象为中心的方法有助于克服这些挑战。

Conclusion: 以对象为中心的方法在处理复杂场景的机器人操作任务上有潜力。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多模态反讽理解任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出 Commander - GPT 模块化决策路由框架，协调不同类型 LLM 代理执行子任务，引入三种集中式指挥官协调。

Result: 在 MMSD 和 MMSD 2.0 基准上评估，对比五种提示策略，F1 分数比现有最优基线平均提高 4.4% 和 11.7%。

Conclusion: Commander - GPT 框架在多模态反讽理解任务中有效。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 现有方法在大模型工具链编排存在问题，本文提出NaviAgent架构，实验表明其任务成功率高，平衡了质量和效率，图编码导航器作用显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型依赖静态知识、工具调用脆弱，现有方法执行路径单一、错误恢复差和搜索空间大的问题。

Method: 引入NaviAgent，包含多路径决策器和图编码导航器，多路径决策器定义四维决策空间，图编码导航器构建工具依赖异构图并采用启发式搜索策略。

Result: NaviAgent在各基础模型和任务复杂度下任务成功率最高，执行步骤接近高效基线，微调的小模型表现超更大模型，图编码导航器平均提升成功率2.4点。

Conclusion: NaviAgent架构在工具链编排中有效，图编码导航器至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: D&D战斗平衡需DM手动评估多因素且不能打断叙事，任务复杂。

Method: 将问题框架为上下文老虎机，基于实时玩家属性生成战斗，用强化学习优化。

Result: 相比经典DM启发式，延长战斗时长200%，降低玩家战后生命值16.67%，增加玩家死亡数且保持低全灭率，胜率70%；相比人类DM设计，提升战斗策略深度和难度并保持公平性。

Conclusion: NTRL方法在D&D战斗难度动态调整上有更好表现。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

Motivation: 高绩效ML方法不透明限制应用，符号方法虽有可解释性但预测力不足，需一种兼顾两者的方法。

Method: 提出混合方法，将FOLD - R++算法的ASP规则与黑盒ML分类器集成，选择性纠正不确定预测并提供解释。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集实验中，准确性和F1分数有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理与传统ML可在不牺牲准确性的情况下实现高可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: TAPAS是一种有效的结合大语言模型与符号规划解决复杂任务的多智能体框架。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在增量学习场景中跨领域性能难以维持，现有提示学习方法存在局限，缺乏多领域任务增量学习策略且多为单模态提示。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，引入跨模态提示利用视觉和文本信息交互，采用领域自适应文本提示进行多领域持续适应。

Result: 在多领域增量学习基准上的综合实验表明，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt框架有效解决了现有视觉语言模型和提示学习方法的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Conclusion: 智能科学实验室（ISLs）系统对克服当前科学发现的局限性、实现AI驱动科学的变革潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

Result: 证明do - calculus在DMG上的C - DMG中无条件健全且完备，图形准则可扩展。

Conclusion: do - calculus在DMG上的C - DMG中对识别宏观因果效应有良好性质，图形准则可部分扩展。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Motivation: 标准强化学习算法难以捕捉人类和动物快速适应新环境的能力，而快速适应可能依赖情景记忆，Transformer能快速上下文学习且架构类似大脑情景记忆系统，因此研究其在相关问题中的作用。

Method: 训练Transformer在受啮齿动物行为启发的规划任务分布中进行上下文强化学习，并分析模型中出现的学习算法。

Result: 发现表征学习由上下文结构学习和跨上下文对齐支持；模型强化学习策略不同于标准的无模型或基于模型规划，而是通过在记忆令牌中缓存中间计算支持决策；模型表征与大脑海马 - 内嗅系统计算相似。

Conclusion: 记忆可作为计算资源，存储原始经验和缓存计算以支持灵活行为，研究为人工和自然环境中的上下文学习快速适应提供了机制假设。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习融入PdM因模型误设的不确定性限制了工业应用，需解决预测误差对维护决策的影响问题。

Method: 提出IEO框架，联合调整预测模型并直接优化维护结果，开发适用于小数据集的随机扰动梯度下降算法。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过使预测模型训练与维护目标一致，提高了模型误设下的鲁棒性和决策质量，支持不确定环境下更可靠的维护规划。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential

among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

### [29] [From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19724)
*Gyeongwon James Kim,Alex Wilf,Louis-Philippe Morency,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍AutoExperiment基准测试，评估AI代理基于论文自然语言描述实现和运行机器学习实验的能力，发现随着缺失函数数量增加性能下降，强调其对评估AI驱动科学实验进展的意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估AI代理在不同代码起点下实现科学想法的基准测试，需要一个新的基准来评估其能力。

Method: 引入AutoExperiment基准，给定研究论文、关键函数被屏蔽的代码库和实验运行命令，让代理生成缺失代码并在沙盒环境运行实验，通过改变缺失函数数量n调整难度。

Result: 评估了最先进的代理，发现性能随n增加迅速下降，能与环境动态交互的代理表现更好，单次和多次试验成功率有显著差距。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment是评估AI驱动科学实验进展的新基准，凸显了长周期代码生成、上下文检索和自主实验执行的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

TL;DR: 本文提出策略自适应生成引擎SAGE用于查询重写，通过奖励塑造机制提升检索效果，降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询重写方法需大规模监督数据或强化学习探索效率低，旨在改进检索效果。

Method: 用专家策略引导大语言模型，引入SAGE，采用SCS和CRS两种奖励塑造机制。

Result: 实现新的NDCG@10最优结果，代理学会选择最优策略，减少探索，生成简洁重写。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合细致奖励塑造，为下一代信息检索系统提供可扩展、高效且可解释的范式。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯自适应深度强化学习方法在稀疏奖励环境中依赖重建奖励信号，难以准确识别任务，导致利用效率不佳。

Method: 提出SimBelief框架，引入潜在任务信念度量学习相似任务的共同结构，学习跨任务分布的潜在动态，连接共享潜在任务信念特征和特定任务特征。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的MuJoCo和panda - gym任务中，方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SimBelief框架能有效提取相似任务分布的共同特征，在稀疏奖励环境中实现高效任务识别和探索。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型尤其是慢思考模型存在严重幻觉问题，强化学习的奖励机制缺乏事实监督，会加剧幻觉问题。

Method: 提出KnowRL，将基于知识验证的事实奖励融入强化学习训练过程，引导模型进行基于事实的慢思考。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上的实验表明，KnowRL能有效减轻慢思考模型的幻觉，同时保持其原有强大推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL是一种有效的解决大语言模型幻觉问题的方法，代码开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

Motivation: 研究者常不了解或遵循数据可视化原则和指南，导致信息错误或不完整，需分析图表潜在问题。

Method: 使用五个开源大视觉语言模型和五种提示策略，根据选定的数据可视化指南设计问题进行对比。

Result: 模型对图表类型、3D效果等分析效果较好，但对图像质量和刻度标记/标签反馈不可靠，Qwen2.5VL表现最佳，总结提示策略在多数问题上表现最好。

Conclusion: 大视觉语言模型可自动识别图表潜在问题，该方法可在数据可视化其他方面拓展。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

Result: 利用2015年1月至2023年9月Maher码头的数据训练和测试模型，取得了良好的结果。

Conclusion: Temporal - IRL模型可有效预测港口拥堵。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Conclusion: JoyAgents - R1能有效解决异构智能体联合进化问题，在小模型上实现较好性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

Conclusion: 提出的LKA能有效提升预训练模型在医学图像分析中的性能，大核尺寸是关键因素。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
methods across various domains, their effectiveness on medical datasets falls
short of expectations. This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical
images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a
large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT
methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed
to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The
proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise
large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on
various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation
of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained
models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly
used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy
across five medical datasets.

Abstract: In computational engineering, ensuring the integrity and safety of structures
in fields such as aerospace and civil engineering relies on accurate stress
prediction. However, analytical methods are limited to simple test cases, and
displacement-based finite element methods (FEMs), while commonly used, require
a large number of unknowns to achieve high accuracy; stress-based numerical
methods have so far failed to provide a simple and effective alternative. This
work aims to develop a novel numerical approach that overcomes these
limitations by enabling accurate stress prediction with improved flexibility
for complex geometries and boundary conditions and fewer degrees of freedom
(DOFs). The proposed method is based on a spline-based stress function
formulation for the principle of minimum complementary energy, which we apply
to plane, linear elastostatics. The method is first validated against an
analytical power series solution and then tested on two test cases challenging
for current state-of-the-art numerical schemes, a bi-layer cantilever with
anisotropic material behavior, and a cantilever with a non-prismatic,
parabolic-shaped beam geometry. Results demonstrate that our approach, unlike
analytical methods, can be easily applied to general geometries and boundary
conditions, and achieves stress accuracy comparable to that reported in the
literature for displacement-based FEMs, while requiring significantly fewer
DOFs. This novel spline-based stress function approach thus provides an
efficient and flexible tool for accurate stress prediction, with promising
applications in structural analysis and numerical design.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal techniques have led to significant progress in
Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). However, most existing models
focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions
crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer
accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for
clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision
to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the
localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this
localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By
fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT
provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual
grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and
explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial
improvements in both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: The Circular Economy framework emphasizes sustainability by reducing resource
consumption and waste through the reuse of components and materials. This paper
presents ReLink, a computational framework for the circular design of planar
linkage mechanisms using available standard parts. Unlike most mechanism design
methods, which assume the ability to create custom parts and infinite part
availability, ReLink prioritizes the reuse of discrete, standardized
components, thus minimizing the need for new parts. The framework consists of
two main components: design generation, where a generative design algorithm
generates mechanisms from an inventory of available parts, and inverse design,
which uses optimization methods to identify designs that match a user-defined

performance and CO2 footprint when incorporating new parts. Challenges such as
the combinatorial nature of the design problem and the enforcement of valid
solutions are addressed. By combining sustainability principles with kinematic
synthesis, ReLink lays the groundwork for further research into computational
circular design to support the development of systems that integrate reused

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地形生成工具对参数化、可重复性和脚本支持有限，模拟驱动的智能机器开发需要可控特征的人工地形。

Method: 构建模块化、基于Python的库，通过链式简单模块构建复杂参数化地形，支持结构化和基于噪声的地形元素，与Blender集成。

Result: 系统实现高灵活性，易配置和扩展，能对地形特征进行细粒度控制。

Conclusion: 该系统适合要求可重复性、多样性以及与自动化管道集成的工作流程。

Abstract: Simulation-driven development of intelligent machines benefits from
artificial terrains with controllable, well-defined characteristics. However,
most existing tools for terrain generation focus on artist-driven workflows and
visual realism, with limited support for parameterization, reproducibility, or
scripting. We present a modular, Python-based library for procedural terrain
generation that enables users to construct complex, parameterized terrains by
chaining together simple modules. The system supports both structured and
noise-based terrain elements, and integrates with Blender for rendering and
object placement. The framework is designed to support applications such as
generating synthetic terrains for training machine learning models or producing
ground truth for perception tasks. By using a minimal but extensible set of
modules, the system achieves high flexibility while remaining easy to configure
and expand. We demonstrate that this enables fine-grained control over features
such as slope, roughness, and the number of rocks, as well as extension to
additional measures. This makes it well suited for workflows that demand
reproducibility, variation, and integration with automated pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文引入SQL问题调试基准BIRD - CRITIC，提出训练环境Six - Gym和f - Plan Boosting方法，集成开发开源代理Bird - Fixer，其在调试任务上超越部分专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在调试复杂SQL问题上缺乏严格评估，且推进开源数据库模型对本地开发和数据隐私保护很重要。

Method: 引入BIRD - CRITIC基准，提出Six - Gym训练环境及SQL - Rewind策略，提出f - Plan Boosting方法，集成开发Bird - Fixer代理。

Result: 领先推理模型O3 - Mini在BIRD - CRITIC基准上成功率低，Bird - Fixer基于Qwen - 2.5 - Coder - 14B，在基准上成功率超越Claude - 3.7 - Sonnet和GPT - 4.1等专有模型。

Conclusion: 研究向普及复杂SQL调试能力迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

Motivation: 现有图数据库无法支持高阶交互，而高阶交互对如子图计数等任务至关重要。

Method: 引入HO - GDBs，用升降范式扩展传统GDBs，对OLTP和OLAP查询进行理论分析，实现轻量级、模块化和可并行化的原型。

Result: 原型可扩展到大型高阶OLTP和OLAP工作负载，提高分析任务效果，如使图神经网络准确率提高44%。

Conclusion: 工作确保低延迟和高查询吞吐量，泛化了符合ACID和最终一致的系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

Motivation: AI等技术发展使HPC需求大增，大学HPC系统资源不足，需全面评估美国大学HPC情况。

Method: 对超50所顶尖研究机构进行调研，分析计算能力、架构设计、治理模式和能源效率。

Result: 大学集群增长轨迹明显低于国家和工业系统，GPU密集型AI工作负载使能力差距扩大。

Conclusion: 提出联合计算、闲置GPU收集和成本分摊等模式，新兴范式可促进校园AI训练，为相关方提供行动见解。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

Result: 得到在约束条件下最大化可靠性和改善区域覆盖的方法。

Conclusion: 通过推广算法能实现单位球图高可靠性和均匀区域覆盖。

Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in
Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$.
These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks,
including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such
an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly
reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered
inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball
graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary
conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to
determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single
vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an
efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a
location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in
many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often
contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to
improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a
location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the
reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within
some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high
reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a
modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.

Motivation: 现有去中心化存储协议在吞吐量、延迟、性价比和可用性方面不足，导致 Web3 数据密集型应用依赖中心化基础设施，需设计新协议满足需求。

Method: 分离控制和数据平面，使用低复制开销和最小修复带宽的纠删码，通过专用骨干网连接 RPC 和存储节点，付费读取激励性能，引入新型审计协议。

Result: 构建了能为生产规模、读密集型 Web3 应用带来 Web2 级性能的去中心化系统。

Abstract: Existing decentralized storage protocols fall short of the service required
by real-world applications. Their throughput, latency, cost-effectiveness, and
availability are insufficient for demanding workloads such as video streaming,
large-scale data analytics, or AI training. As a result, Web3 data-intensive
applications are predominantly dependent on centralized infrastructure.
  Shelby is a high-performance decentralized storage protocol designed to meet
demanding needs. It achieves fast, reliable access to large volumes of data
while preserving decentralization guarantees. The architecture reflects lessons
from Web2 systems: it separates control and data planes, uses erasure coding
with low replication overhead and minimal repair bandwidth, and operates over a
dedicated backbone connecting RPC and storage nodes. Reads are paid, which
incentivizes good performance. Shelby also introduces a novel auditing protocol
that provides strong cryptoeconomic guarantees without compromising
performance, a common limitation of other decentralized solutions. The result
is a decentralized system that brings Web2-grade performance to
production-scale, read-intensive Web3 applications.

Motivation: 分析闪电网络作为货币系统与比特币基础层结算模型的差异。

Method: 采用数学建模、博弈论证明和复杂性分析等方法。

Result: 闪电网络可通过流动性枢纽寡头实现无限链下操作，枢纽具有未监管金融中介的特性，通道关闭经济上不可行，路由问题接近P - Space复杂度的难度极限。

Conclusion: 闪电网络不仅是对比特币的扩展，而是一个具有影子银行特征的合成金融系统，缺乏储备纪律、透明度和可执行的结算保证。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary
system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We
demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise
superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing
costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic
proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite
off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs
exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent
extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that
channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach
hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not
merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with
shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or
enforceable settlement guarantees.

Conclusion: 所提方法和启发式策略能有效提升单源最短路径算法性能。

Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is well-known for the
challenges in developing fast, practical, and work-efficient parallel
algorithms. This work introduces a novel shortest path search method. It allows
paths with different lengths to be extended in parallel at the cost of almost
negligible repeated relaxations. A dynamic-stepping heuristic is proposed for
the method to efficiently reduce the extended paths and the synchronizations. A
traversal-optimization heuristic is proposed to improve the method by
efficiently reducing the created paths and alleviating the load imbalance.
Based on the method, the two heuristics are used to develop a practical SSSP
algorithm, which tactfully reduces workload and overhead. The heuristics and
the algorithm were evaluated on 73 real-world and synthetic graphs. The
algorithm was also compared with five state-of-the-art SSSP implementations. On
each GAP benchmark suite graph except Road, its speedup to the best achieved by
these five implementations is 2.5x to 5.83x.

Abstract: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree constructions
are classical problems in distributed computing, traditionally studied in the
message-passing model, where static nodes communicate via messages. This paper
investigates MST and BFS tree construction in an agent-based network, where
mobile agents explore a graph and compute. Each node hosts one agent, and
communication occurs when agents meet at a node. We consider $n$ agents
initially dispersed (one per node) in an anonymous, arbitrary $n$-node,
$m$-edge graph $G$. The goal is to construct the BFS and MST trees from this
configuration such that each tree edge is known to at least one of its
endpoints, while minimizing time and memory per agent. We work in a synchronous
model and assume agents have no prior knowledge of any graph parameters such as
$n$, $m$, $D$, $\Delta$ (graph diameter and maximum degree). Prior work solves
BFS in $O(D\Delta)$ rounds with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent, assuming the root
is known. We give a deterministic algorithm that constructs the BFS tree in
$O(\min(D\Delta, m\log n) + n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds using $O(\log
n)$ bits per agent without root knowledge. To determine the root, we solve
leader election and MST construction. We elect a leader and construct the MST
in $O(n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent.
Prior MST algorithms require $O(m + n\log n)$ rounds and $\max(\Delta, \log n)
\log n$ bits. Our results significantly improve memory efficiency and time,
achieving nearly linear-time leader election and MST. Agents are assumed to
know $\lambda$, the maximum identifier, bounded by a polynomial in $n$.

Conclusion: 文中未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

Result: 综合模拟验证PS - WL优于现有方法，显著降低性能开销，持续有效降低不同系统配置和工作负载下的阵列聚合故障风险。

Conclusion: PS - WL通过直接优化可靠性，构建了更安全、高效和稳定的可扩展存储系统。

Abstract: As flash-based Solid State Drive (SSD) arrays become essential to modern data
centers, scaling these arrays to meet explosive data growth is a frequent and
critical operation. However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm
applied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the
non-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially
pushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address
this critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear
Leveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear
to directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an "effective
lifetime" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately
assess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling
operation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by
restricting warm data migration. Comprehensive simulations validate the
superiority of PS-WL over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate
that our approach significantly reduces performance overhead while, most
critically, consistently and effectively lowering the aggregated array failure
risk across diverse system configurations and workloads. This proves that by
directly optimizing for reliability, PS-WL builds a scalable storage system
that is, by design, fundamentally safer, more efficient, and more stable.

Abstract: A subcoloring of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into subsets
(called colors), each inducing a disjoint union of cliques. It is a natural
generalization of the classical proper coloring, in which each color must
instead induce an independent set. Similarly to proper coloring, we define the
subchromatic number of a graph as the minimum integer k such that it admits a
subcoloring with k colors, and the corresponding problem k-Subcoloring which
asks whether a graph has subchromatic number at most k. In this paper, we
initiate the study of the subcoloring of (unit) disk graphs. One motivation
stems from the fact that disk graphs can be seen as a dense generalization of
planar graphs where, intuitively, each vertex can be blown into a large
clique--much like subcoloring generalizes proper coloring. Interestingly, it
can be observed that every unit disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most 7
colors. We first prove that the subchromatic number can be 3-approximated in
polynomial-time in unit disk graphs. We then present several hardness results
for special cases of unit disk graphs which somehow prevents the use of
classical approaches for improving this result. We show in particular that
2-subcoloring remains NP-hard in triangle-free unit disk graphs, as well as in
unit disk graphs representable within a strip of bounded height. We also solve
an open question of Broersma, Fomin, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, and Woeginger (2002) by
proving that 3-Subcoloring remains NP-hard in co-comparability graphs. Finally,
we prove that every $n$-vertex disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most
$O(\log^3(n))$ colors and present a $O(\log^2(n))$-approximation algorithm for
computing the subchromatic number of such graphs. This is achieved by defining
a decomposition and a special type of co-comparability disk graph, called
$\Delta$-disk graphs, which might be of independent interest.

multiterminal cuts on graphs, k-cuts on hypergraphs, and elementary linear
algebra problems such as matrix multiway partitioning. This research has been
divided between the fixed terminal setting, where we are given a set of
terminals that must be separated by P, and the global setting, where the only
constraint is the size of the partition. We investigate a generalization that
unifies these two settings: minimum submodular matroid-constrained partition.
In this problem, we are additionally given a matroid over the ground set and
seek to find a partition P in which there exists some basis that is separated
by P. We explore the approximability of this problem and its variants, reaching
the state of the art for the special case of symmetric submodular functions,
and provide results for monotone and general submodular functions as well.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究未知环境下顺序拍卖的在线动态机制设计，建模为无限期平均奖励MDP，扩展VCG机制，开发在线强化学习算法，证明机制渐近收敛并保证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将问题建模为多臂老虎机或 episodic MDP，环境会重置，本文考虑市场持续演变更现实的场景。

Method: 将顺序拍卖建模为无限期平均奖励MDP，扩展VCG机制得到动态VCG机制，开发在线强化学习算法学习MDP模型并实现类似动态VCG机制。

Result: 所学习的在线机制渐近收敛到近似满足效率、真实性和个体理性的动态机制，且在各种遗憾概念上有保证的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可有效解决未知环境下顺序拍卖的在线动态机制设计问题，实现较好的机制特性和性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

TL;DR: 文章针对决策过程中确定性选择规则的可靠性问题，提出基于区间估计的随机决策框架MERIT，开发算法求解并进行实验验证其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策过程中确定性选择规则受评估误差和结果不确定性影响，现有随机化方法不适用，需要更优方法。

Method: 提出基于区间估计的随机决策框架，引入MERIT方法，通过优化最大化最坏情况下选中顶级候选者的期望数量，开发多项式时间算法求解。

Result: 算法可处理超10000个项目，满足理想公理性质，在合成同行评审数据实验中，在期望效用上与现有算法相当，在最坏情况公式下表现更优。

Conclusion: MERIT是一种更优的随机决策方法，在处理不确定性时有良好表现。

Abstract: Many decision-making processes involve evaluating and then selecting items;
examples include scientific peer review, job hiring, school admissions, and
investment decisions. The eventual selection is performed by applying rules or
deliberations to the raw evaluations, and then deterministically selecting the
items deemed to be the best. These domains feature error-prone evaluations and
uncertainty about future outcomes, which undermine the reliability of such
deterministic selection rules. As a result, selection mechanisms involving
explicit randomization that incorporate the uncertainty are gaining traction in
practice. However, current randomization approaches are ad hoc, and as we
prove, inappropriate for their purported objectives. In this paper, we propose
a principled framework for randomized decision-making based on interval
estimates of the quality of each item. We introduce MERIT (Maximin Efficient
Randomized Interval Top-k), an optimization-based method that maximizes the
worst-case expected number of top candidates selected, under uncertainty
represented by overlapping intervals (e.g., confidence intervals or min-max
intervals). MERIT provides an optimal resource allocation scheme under an
interpretable notion of robustness. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to
solve the optimization problem and demonstrate empirically that the method
scales to over 10,000 items. We prove that MERIT satisfies desirable axiomatic
properties not guaranteed by existing approaches. Finally, we empirically
compare algorithms on synthetic peer review data. Our experiments demonstrate
that MERIT matches the performance of existing algorithms in expected utility
under fully probabilistic review data models used in previous work, while
outperforming previous methods with respect to our novel worst-case
formulation.

Conclusion: 研究结果受医院项目和学校容量影响，较大容量改善医院和学校结果，但对医生或学生影响不大，还讨论了学校选择场景结果在住院医师场景的扩展情况。

Abstract: In real-world settings of the Deferred Acceptance stable matching algorithm,
such as the American medical residency match (NRMP), school choice programs,
and various national university entrance systems, candidates need to decide
which programs to list. In many of these settings there is an initial phase of
interviews or information gathering which affect the preferences on one or both
sides. We ask: which interviews should candidates seek? We study this question
in a model, introduced by Lee (2016) and modified by Allman and Ashlagi (2023),
with preferences based on correlated cardinal utilities.
  We describe a distributed, low-communication strategy for the doctors and
students, which lead to non-match rates of $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}))}$ in
the residency setting and $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(k))}$ in the school-choice
setting, where $k$ is the number of interviews per doctor in the first setting,
and the number of proposals per student in the second setting; these bounds do
not apply to the agents with the lowest public ratings, the bottommost agents,
who may not fare as well. We also obtain bounds on the expected utilities each
non-bottommost agent obtains.
  These results are parameterized by the capacity of the hospital programs and
schools. Larger capacities improve the outcome for the hospitals and schools,
but don't significantly affect the outcomes of the doctors or students.
Finally, in the school choice setting we obtain an $\epsilon$-Nash type
equilibrium for the students apart from the bottommost ones; importantly, the
equilibrium holds regardless of the actions of the bottommost students. We also
discuss to what extent this result extends to the residency setting. We
complement our theoretical results with an experimental study that shows the
asymptotic results hold for real-world values of $n$.

Conclusion: Agentic Deep Research将成为未来信息检索的主导范式。

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,
including industry products, research papers, benchmark datasets, and
open-source implementations, are collected for the community in

Conclusion: NEAR²方法可在推理时提升嵌入大小效率，不增加训练成本且提高准确率。

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

Motivation: 推荐系统受用户行为驱动，易捕捉敏感特征偏好导致推荐不公平，扩散模型在建模不确定性和多样性上有优势，可用于推荐公平性建模。

Method: 提出FairGENRec模型，训练阶段注入随机噪声并设计顺序去噪模型，同时注入消除敏感特征偏差的多兴趣表示信息；推理阶段利用历史交互获取噪声并反向迭代重构目标物品表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的大量实验证明FairGENRec在准确性和公平性上有双重提升效果，案例统计分析可视化了推荐公平性的改善程度。

Conclusion: FairGENRec模型能有效增强推荐的准确性和公平性。

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL方法处理复杂查询有局限，多步流程计算成本高、易出错。

Method: 提出HI - SQL，利用历史查询日志生成上下文提示，融入SQL生成过程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集实验中，显著提高查询准确性，保证大语言模型调用效率和低延迟。

Conclusion: HI - SQL为增强文本到SQL系统提供了可靠实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of edge devices has driven the demand for deploying

survey presents a comprehensive overview of the transition from TinyML to
TinyDL, encompassing architectural innovations, hardware platforms, model
optimization techniques, and software toolchains. We analyze state-of-the-art
methods in quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search (NAS), and
examine hardware trends from MCUs to dedicated neural accelerators.
Furthermore, we categorize software deployment frameworks, compilers, and
AutoML tools enabling practical on-device learning. Applications across domains
such as computer vision, audio recognition, healthcare, and industrial
monitoring are reviewed to illustrate the real-world impact of TinyDL. Finally,
we identify emerging directions including neuromorphic computing, federated
TinyDL, edge-native foundation models, and domain-specific co-design
approaches. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for
researchers and practitioners, offering a holistic view of the ecosystem and
laying the groundwork for future advancements in edge AI.

Motivation: 大语言模型使用LoRA微调会损害安全对齐，现有安全对齐方法难以捕捉复杂参数变化，导致安全 - 效用权衡不佳。

Method: 提出基于剪枝的SPLoRA方法，选择性移除削弱安全对齐的LoRA层；引入Empirical - DIEM (E - DIEM) 度量检测安全失准。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验，SPLoRA优于现有安全对齐技术，显著降低安全风险，保持或提升模型性能和可靠性，还减少推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是部署更安全可靠大语言模型的可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

Method: 在每层引入顺序专家通信，使用专用路由器支持动态专家选择，让令牌在每次迭代中重新评估并选择不同专家。

Result: 在数学推理任务上降低验证损失，提供新的扩展维度，减少内存使用。

Conclusion: CoE的优势源于迭代残差结构和迭代路由增强的专家专业化，解锁更具表现力的表示。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Result: GradualDiff - Fed性能与集中训练相当，大幅降低通信开销。

Conclusion: GradualDiff - Fed是在隐私保护下分布式数据微调大模型的有效方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created

preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Result: 在三个案例研究中，学习到的表示尊重规定的几何结构，捕获内在非欧几里得结构。

Conclusion: 方法仅需解码器，与现有架构兼容，产生与数据几何对齐的可解释潜在空间。

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Conclusion: 在共享表示框架下用户级差分隐私的模型个性化问题上，所提方法有效，且在该设置下维度无关的风险界限是可能的。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Result: 构建并分析多个例子，发现神经网络作为算法通常是递归和并行的。

Conclusion: ReLU网络受连续性限制，递归深度受网络深度限制，深度网络性能更优。

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

Result: 实现了k - 均值聚类的全神经实现，且对架构修改得到多种聚类算法变体。

Conclusion: transformer机制可精确映射到算法过程，为在transformer中实现精确算法提供清晰可解释视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

Conclusion: Command - V是一种有效且计算成本低的大语言模型行为转移方法。

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

Motivation: 探究过度优化验证误差是否会导致 HPO 层面的过拟合，即过调现象，且该现象在相关文献中受关注较少。

Method: 对 HPO 基准数据进行大规模重新分析，分析多种因素对过调的影响。

Result: 过调比以往认为的更常见，通常较轻微但偶尔严重，约 10%的情况会选到泛化误差更差的超参数配置。

Conclusion: 需要提高对过调现象的认识，特别是在小数据场景下，应进一步研究缓解策略。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the
universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive
definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving
manifold-valued data.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

TL;DR: 提出Concentration - Adapted Perturbations (CAP)变分框架用于深度神经网络不确定性量化，实验表明其改善模型校准且计算开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变分推理方法在权重空间采用各向同性高斯近似，与网络固有几何不匹配，需要更好的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 引入CAP变分框架，在单位超球面上用von Mises - Fisher分布建模权重不确定性，推导vMF浓度参数与激活噪声方差的联系，用新型闭式KL散度正则化器让每层学习最优不确定性水平。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10实验中，CAP显著改善模型校准，将预期校准误差降低5.6倍，提供可解释的逐层不确定性概况。

Conclusion: CAP是一种理论上有依据且实用的深度学习不确定性量化方法，计算开销小，可无缝集成到标准架构中。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过实验证明，对冲可在最小计算开销下缓解奖励破解，取得更优的失真 - 奖励权衡。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

Method: 交叉正则化，在训练中通过验证梯度直接调整正则化参数，拆分参数优化，训练数据用于特征学习，验证数据控制复杂度。

Result: 在神经网络中通过噪声注入实现时，展现出高噪声容忍度和特定架构正则化等模式。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能控制复杂度，还可与数据增强等集成，且通过简单梯度方法保持单轮效率。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，与TGN相比，BADGNN性能良好，能支持更大批次和更快训练。

Conclusion: BADGNN框架能解决MDGNN大批次训练的问题，具有较好性能和训练效率。

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Conclusion: 提出的基于深度学习的EOCS方法适用于在线继电保护定值计算，有更好性能。

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Result: 在17个基准数据集实验表明DGMAE能有效保留节点差异，在节点分类、聚类和图分类任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DGMAE具有显著优越性，代码开源。

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

generates applicant-specific XAI visual reports and business impact summaries
to ensure transparent decision-making.

Motivation: 电磁结构设计因高维设计空间和昂贵评估面临挑战，现有方法数据需求大且受现实规模和预算限制。

Method: 提出PQS方法，将传统类图像布局转换为基于四叉树的层次表示以进行渐进搜索，引入一致性驱动的样本选择机制。

Result: 在两个实际工程任务上评估，能在有限计算预算下获得满意设计，相比生成式方法削减75 - 85%评估成本，节省20.27 - 38.80天产品设计周期。

Conclusion: PQS方法在电磁结构设计中能有效应对高维设计空间和预算限制问题，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: 本文提出μTransfer - FNO技术解决FNO处理复杂PDE时超参数调优计算成本高的问题，经实验验证可降低调优成本并保持或提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fourier Neural Operators（FNOs）处理更复杂PDE时需增加傅里叶模式数量，导致模型参数增多，超参数调优计算成本高。

Method: 引入μTransfer - FNO零样本超参数转移技术，基于Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）框架推导参数化方案，实现不同傅里叶模式数量的FNO模型间最优超参数转移。

Result: 在各种PDE上的大量实验表明，Transfer - FNO降低了大型FNO超参数调优的计算成本，同时保持或提高了精度。

Conclusion: μTransfer - FNO技术可有效解决FNO处理复杂PDE时超参数调优的计算成本问题。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Result: 在多个多智能体强化学习基准测试中，FIM相比基线显著提高了合作性能。

Conclusion: FIM能在极稀疏奖励设置下促进智能体有效合作。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于标签的因果发现方法，提升因果发现效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有为变量分配特定类型以进行因果发现的方法在实践中较难操作，且基于单一类型的假设缺乏鲁棒性和灵活性。

Method: 为因果图中每个变量分配多个标签，先使用现有因果发现方法确定部分边的方向，再确定标签间的边关系，最后用这些关系确定无向边方向。

Result: 实验表明该方法能提升因果发现效果，且高层标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 基于标签的因果发现方法优于纯基于类型的关系，能有效提升因果发现。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

Conclusion: 提出的框架易于实现，可通过少量代码改进现有分布算法来处理高估问题。

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Motivation: 现有机器学习无学习（MU）技术漏洞研究不足，且现有攻击研究需访问含隐私数据的原模型，违背MU隐私保护目标。

Method: 实施具有师生知识蒸馏架构的成员召回攻击（MRA）框架，将无学习模型作为噪声标注器向学生模型传递知识，转化为带噪声标签学习问题来推断遗忘实例的正确标签。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上对先进MU方法的大量实验表明，MRA策略在恢复无学习实例的类成员关系方面表现出高效性。

Conclusion: 本研究和评估为未来MU漏洞研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上进行了广泛实验，所有评估结果表明COLUR在模型恢复和细化后始终优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: COLUR框架能有效解决含噪声标签数据导致的模型性能下降问题，具有较好的效果。

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Conclusion: 迭代降维程序可与任何符号回归方法结合使用，能提升算法性能

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

Conclusion: 所提方法满足几何最优性和最大匹配，克服了对类别数量先验的需求，达到了最先进性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Result: 在五个真实数据集上评估，FAF始终优于基线模型，在CO₂排放数据集上比最佳基线iTransformer提升41.81%。

Conclusion: FAF设计使模型在历史数据稀疏时能实现稳健和个性化预测。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

Result: 使用全似然方法时大模型能提升性能，基于更多特征训练的大模型预测效果更好。

Conclusion: DeepWAS方法有助于训练大模型，可能改善疾病预测和治疗靶点识别。

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Conclusion: 系统搜索小表达式空间是一种更优的符号回归方法。

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Result: 在流行的计算机视觉模型上的实验表明，校准策略产生的解释更符合人类感知和实际对象位置。

Conclusion: ReCalX方法能有效提高基于扰动的解释质量。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Conclusion: 通过CAAT - Net可在不充分同步激活的情况下训练大语言模型，降低带宽需求。

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Result: 在一系列实验中，该方法比现有技术减少20%测试误分类，扩展到自然语言处理任务，通过消融实验获得实用见解。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，代码开源可查。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Result: 结果表明在共形预测中可保持可证明的性能，同时减少重复校准需求，提高实用性。

Conclusion: 可以在共形预测中保持可证明的性能，通过减少重复校准增强其实用性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Conclusion: 该方法在最小化基于内存的持续学习算法的内存占用方面有很大潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Motivation: 数据隐私受关注，现有 HE 下 DNN 训练有计算开销和算法复杂度问题，此前研究受限。

Method: 基于 CKKS 方案，引入基于局部误差信号的 HE 兼容神经网络架构，采用定制打包策略，集成近似自举。

Result: 在图像识别和表格基准测试中，精度与 32 位浮点明文训练相当，比加密逻辑回归最高提 3.27%，比现有加密 DNN 框架最高提 6.83%，训练延迟最多降 8.83 倍。

Conclusion: ReBoot 可实现全加密训练，适合机器学习即服务，已开源。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

TL;DR: 提出Outlier - Safe Pre - Training (OSP)解决大语言模型激活异常值影响量化性能问题，训练出无异常值的生产级模型，提升量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的极端激活异常值严重降低量化性能，阻碍设备端高效部署，且现有缓解方法实践困难。

Method: 引入OSP，结合Muon优化器、Single - Scale RMSNorm和可学习嵌入投影三种创新方法。

Result: 训练1.4B参数模型，在激进4位量化下，OSP模型在10个基准测试中平均得分35.7（Adam训练模型为26.5），训练开销仅2%，且OSP模型峰度接近零。

Conclusion: 异常值并非大语言模型固有，而是训练策略的结果，为更高效的大语言模型部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints
are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Outlier-Safe-Pre-Training.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

Result: 通过多数据集和模型实验，FDG提升样本保真度并保留多样性，FID和召回率优于CFG。

Conclusion: FDG可作为标准无分类器指导的即插即用替代方法。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: MSA是解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络的强大方法。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Conclusion: 应将焦点从架构工程转移到输入策划，物理驱动的数据转换对提升深度学习性能有重要作用。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

Motivation: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all

TL;DR: 现有语言模型对齐技术有局限，本文提出Multi - Preference Lambda - weighted Listwise DPO框架，兼顾多偏好维度和动态插值，效果好且适应性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型对齐技术如RLHF计算量大、不稳定，DPO及其扩展灵活性不足，需新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Multi - Preference Lambda - weighted Listwise DPO框架，结合多人类偏好维度，通过可控单纯形加权公式实现动态插值，支持列表偏好反馈和跨不同用户意图的灵活对齐。

Result: 实证和理论分析表明该方法在静态目标上与传统DPO效果相当。

Conclusion: 该方法既有效又具有更强的通用性和适应性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出新的加权方案改进物理信息神经网络解决偏微分方程的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络受计算限制，用有限点优化难以保证收敛性和准确性

Method: 提出一种自适应改变损失函数权重的方案，从孤立点扩展到连续邻域区域

Result: 新的加权方案能降低相对$L^2$误差

Conclusion: 新的加权方案有效提升了物理信息神经网络解决偏微分方程的性能

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多值动力系统、推荐算法和无损压缩等场景下提出更合适的在线学习方式。

Method: 定义模糊在线学习，给出预测正确性判断方法，分析假设类的错误界。

Result: 在模糊在线学习设置下，假设类的最优错误界在对数因子范围内有三种：Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习有其独特的错误界情况，在特定场景有应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术策展多依赖人类专家主观工作且缺乏明确规则，希望构建AI模型完成类似策展工作。

Method: 基于机器学习技术构建四个AI模型，学习纽约大都会博物馆过去25年人类专家策划的展览。

Result: 四个AI模型能在一定精度和策展连贯性上模仿策展人工作。

Conclusion: 一是展览中有足够信息构建高于随机选择准确率的AI模型；二是适度规模模型经特征工程和架构设计可媲美大语言模型；更多数据下AI能更接近人类策展判断。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

Motivation: 理解语言模型从训练到更广泛部署分布的泛化行为是AI安全的重要问题，拓展先前发现的紧急失准现象研究。

Method: 在不同条件下展示紧急失准现象，用稀疏自编码器的模型对比方法比较微调前后模型内部表征。

Conclusion: 模型对比方法能揭示紧急失准机制，微调少量良性样本可作为缓解紧急失准的策略。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Lookahead Reasoning方法提升推理模型解码速度，通过利用额外并行性提高token-level speculative decoding的加速效果，在多基准测试中取得更好的加速比并保持答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token-level speculative decoding在推理模型长链思考解码时加速效果有限，存在算法天花板。

Method: 提出Lookahead Reasoning方法，利用推理模型按步骤生成的特性，让轻量级草稿模型提出未来步骤，目标模型批量扩展，验证器保留语义正确步骤，同时token-level SD在每个推理步骤内仍起作用。

Result: 理论和实验表明Lookahead Reasoning提升了token-level SD的峰值加速比，在GSM8K、AIME等基准测试中，将加速比从1.4x提高到2.1x，且随着GPU吞吐量增加加速比表现更好。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning方法有效提升推理模型解码速度，在不降低答案质量的情况下提高加速效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出OFTv2改进OFT，降低计算成本，提高训练速度和减少内存使用，还支持微调量化基础模型且表现优于QLoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFT存在高运行时间和内存需求的问题，限制实际部署，其核心计算瓶颈在于以权重为中心的实现。

Method: 提出OFTv2，采用以输入为中心的重新表述，使用矩阵 - 向量乘法；引入Cayley - Neumann参数化来近似Cayley变换中的矩阵求逆。

Result: OFTv2训练速度提升达10倍，GPU内存使用降低3倍，且性能不受影响；在微调量化基础模型时，在训练稳定性、效率和内存使用方面优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2有效解决了OFT的计算瓶颈问题，在训练速度、内存使用和性能等方面表现出色。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

<details>

Motivation: 直接训练的脉冲神经网络因神经形态数据集规模有限和梯度不匹配问题，存在严重过拟合，制约泛化性能。

Method: 引入与时间相关的正则化机制，对早期时间步施加更强约束，提出TRT方法；在多个数据集上与其他先进方法对比；进行消融研究和分析；基于Fisher信息分析给出理论解释。

Conclusion: TRT的时间衰减正则化机制能引导网络在信息丰富的早期时间步学习鲁棒特征，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular

behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的无执行故障定位主要关注被测系统，未关注复杂测试代码，而测试代码故障也会引发失败，需解决此问题。

Method: 用单个失败执行日志，通过三种新算法估计测试执行轨迹，结合错误信息提示LLM对潜在故障位置排序。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，块级故障定位能平衡搜索空间和上下文信息。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically
relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However,
repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic
failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large
Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused
on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often
complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in
practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test
code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.
Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution
trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely
involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is
used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,
system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is
applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate
our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset
of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show
that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of
around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the
LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our
results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance,
narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81%
hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).

<details>

Motivation: 符号执行在建模目标代码和约束求解能力上受限，大语言模型缺乏系统枚举程序路径的机制且难以覆盖细微边界情况。

Method: 通过AST级分析静态枚举可能路径并转换为可执行变体，提供可视化前端展示路径覆盖和生成的测试。

Result: 用户研究表明，PALM的前端有助于用户更好地理解路径覆盖，识别哪些路径被测试覆盖。

Conclusion: PALM系统有效结合了符号执行和大语言模型的优势，其前端对用户理解和分析测试情况有帮助。

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering
systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it
is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code
including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability
of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex
features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test
inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths
and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting
an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In
this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic
path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates
possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an
executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This
avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead
constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the
first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage
alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they
exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend
helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are
actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and
visualization of their path profiles.

Conclusion: 现有二进制分解方法在不同编译设置下存在不足，需要更好的方法来应对FCG的变化。

Abstract: Binary decomposition, which decomposes binary files into modules, plays a
critical role in binary reuse detection. Existing binary decomposition works
either apply anchor-based methods by extending anchor functions to generate
modules, or apply clustering-based methods by using clustering algorithms to
group binary functions, which all rely on that reused code shares similar
function call relationships. However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs)
vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse
function inlining decisions.
  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance
of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on
binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17
compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and
mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while
the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we
evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that
existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler
evaluation with diverse optimization settings. Finally, we propose a method to
identify the optimal decomposition and compare the existing decomposition works
with the optimal decomposition. Existing works either suffer from low coverage
or cannot generate stable community similarities.

Abstract: Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance.
Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However,
this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze
the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we
put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate
the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to
evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and
semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent
system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code
analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the
effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we
conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The
results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based
multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an
improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance
efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was
optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based
multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional
programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems
integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can
enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管结对编程有诸多益处，但软件团队对其采用情况不一，旨在了解促进或阻碍团队成员采用及持续参与结对编程的因素。

Method: 在挪威一家成熟的敏捷公司开展探索性单案例研究，通过两轮对不同角色团队成员的访谈收集数据并进行主题分析。

Result: 多个与结对编程对日常工作的贡献感知、参与结对编程的努力、公司和团队态度、资源、基础设施及任务特征相关的因素影响结对编程的参与度。

Conclusion: 长期参与结对编程需要在实践中确认预期益处，根据团队情况调整实践有益，研究结果对软件从业者将结对编程融入团队工作流有帮助。

Abstract: Context: Pair programming (PP) is more relevant than ever. As modern systems
grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have
become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption
remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to
understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well
as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory
single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data
through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and
performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is
that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to
daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team
attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP
engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits
with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the
practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is
also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners
seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.

TL;DR: 本文提出 Reptile 工具将正则表达式转换为 DPL 模式并优化，评估显示有较好效果，对迁移日志分析平台有实际意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户迁移到新日志分析平台时，手动将正则表达式转换为新模式语言成本高且易出错。

Method: 结合基于规则的方法和尽力而为的方法进行转换，集成 GPT - 4 优化 DPL 模式。

Result: 用 946 个正则表达式评估，73.7% 被安全转换；用 23 个真实正则表达式评估优化效果，F1 分数和 MCC 高于 0.91。

Conclusion: 结果有前景，对迁移到现代日志分析平台的公司有实际意义。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

*Antonios Saravanos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过系统映射研究，分析2000 - 2024年同行评审文献中瀑布模型在计算模拟中的呈现情况，发现离散事件模拟常用，工具从专有平台转向开源Python工具，且无研究完全实现原始模型，强调需易获取建模工具及未来研究结合瀑布模型与现代混合实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管敏捷方法主导当代软件设计实践，但瀑布模型仍存在于混合方法中，而其在研究环境中的模拟情况受关注较少，因此开展研究。

Method: 对主要学术数据库进行结构化搜索，确定2000 - 2024年的68篇同行评审研究，按模拟方法、平台工具、地理和时间趋势、与原始模型保真度四个维度分析筛选后的研究。

Result: 离散事件模拟最常用；早期用专有平台，近期多用开源Python工具；无研究完全实现Royce原始模型，多采用改编版。

Conclusion: 瀑布模型模拟虽小众但存在于学术论述中，强调需要易获取的建模工具，并呼吁未来研究将瀑布软件过程模型与现代混合实践相结合。

Abstract: This systematic mapping study examines how the Waterfall Model has been
represented in computational simulations within peer-reviewed literature. While
Agile methodologies dominate contemporary software design practices, the
Waterfall Model persists, particularly, within hybrid approaches that fuse
structured, sequential workflows with the adaptability of agile practices.
Despite its continued presence, little attention has been given to how the
Waterfall Model is simulated in research contexts. A structured search of major
academic databases identified 68 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000
and 2024. After applying inclusion criteria, selected studies were analyzed
across four dimensions: (1) simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete-event
simulation, system dynamics), (2) platforms and tools (e.g., Simphony.NET,
SimPy), (3) geographic and temporal trends, and (4) fidelity to Royce's
original seven-phase model. Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used,
reflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary
platforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based
tools. No studies fully implemented Royce's original formulation, most employed
adaptations. These findings suggest that although niche, simulation of the
Waterfall Model is present in academic discourse. This work highlights the need
for accessible modeling tools and calls for future research that integrates the
waterfall software process model with modern hybrid practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限、自托管环境中高效服务CodeLLMs的问题，现有系统静态批处理配置无法适应请求率波动和异构工作负载。

Method: 提出SABER动态批处理策略，实时预测每个请求的SLA可行性并调整决策。

Result: SABER比最佳静态配置提高了26%的吞吐量，减少了45%的延迟可变性，且无需手动调整或重启服务。

Conclusion: SLA感知的自适应调度是实现强大、高性能CodeLLM服务的关键。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly integrated into modern
software development workflows, yet efficiently serving them in
resource-constrained, self-hosted environments remains a significant challenge.
Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput
improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot
adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to
frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In
this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts
per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves
goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency
variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our
results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust,
high-performance CodeLLM serving.

Abstract: Context: Developer experience (DX) plays a key role in developers'
performance and their continued involvement in a software ecosystem (SECO)
platform. While researchers and practitioners have recognized several factors
affecting DX in SECO platforms, a clear roadmap of the most influential factors
is still missing. This is particularly important given the direct impact on
developers' interest in SECO and their ongoing engagement with the common
technological platform. Goal: This work aims to identify key DX factors and
understand how they influence third-party developers' decisions to adopt and
keep contributing to a SECO. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping study
(SMS), analyzing 29 studies to assess the state-of-the-art of DX in SECO.
Additionally, we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the influence of 27 DX
factors (identified in our SMS) from the perspective of 21 third-party
developers to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO. Results: The factors that
most strongly influence developers' adoption and ongoing contributions to a
SECO are: financial costs for using the platform, desired technical resources
for development, low barriers to entry into the applications market, and more
financial gains. Conclusion: DX is essential for the success and sustainability
of SECO. Our set of DX factors provides valuable insights and recommendations
for researchers and practitioners to address key DX concerns from the
perspective of third-party developers.

Abstract: Predicting the probability of default (PD) of prospective loans is a critical
objective for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide variety of prediction
tasks; yet, they remain relatively underutilised in credit risk analysis. This
paper highlights the opportunities that ML algorithms offer to this field by
comparing the performance of five predictive models-Random Forests, Decision
Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost-to the predominantly used
logistic regression, over a benchmark dataset from Scheule et al. (Credit Risk
Analytics: The R Companion). Our findings underscore the strengths and
weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into the most effective
ML algorithms for PD prediction in the context of loan portfolios.

Result: 利用HSLS:09数据展示了敏感性分析和基准方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性分析和基准方法可用于处理因果分解分析中二元风险因素的遗漏混杂问题。

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

Method: 研究浅层ReLU神经网络去噪器概率流，引入更简单的分数流，将结果扩展到钝角单纯形数据并进行正交情况模拟。

Result: 正交数据集下两种流轨迹相似，收敛到训练点或训练点之和；扩散时间调度器提前停止可使概率流到达更一般流形点；模拟证实概率流收敛情况；训练样本增多记忆性降低。

Conclusion: 在简化设置下研究了扩散模型记忆训练样本和生成新点的行为，明确概率流收敛情况及训练样本数量对记忆性的影响。

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

Conclusion: 研究推进了贝叶斯神经网络的理论基础，为其在高维结构化估计问题中的实际有效性提供了严格依据。

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究ABP算法硬度的潜在来源，解释ABP在一定约束密度下存在计算间隙的悖论。

Method: 利用完全提升随机对偶理论（fl RDT）和其大偏差升级（sfl LD RDT）的工具，开发通用框架研究LE。

Result: 在提升的第二层发现LE结果与复制方法结果紧密匹配，对于经典零阈值ABP，LE在(0.77, 0.78)区间崩溃。

Conclusion: LE的行为可能是ABP计算间隙可能存在的关键反映之一。

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Motivation: 研究随机参数ReLU神经网络的ℓᵖ -Lipschitz常数的性质。

Method: 推导宽网络和浅网络的高概率上下界。

Result: 宽网络上下界最多相差与网络宽度对数和深度线性相关的因子，浅网络有匹配界，不同p区间常数表现不同。

Conclusion: 不同p区间，ReLU神经网络的ℓᵖ -Lipschitz常数行为差异显著。

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Method: 对代表主要消费类别的20个Google Trends关键词，应用Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX)、enhanced SAX (eSAX)和Topological Data Analysis (TDA)三种无监督聚类方法。

Result: SAX和eSAX对稳定时间序列聚类快速且可解释，但难以处理波动性和复杂性，常产生模糊聚类；TDA通过持久同调捕获全局结构特征，实现更平衡和有意义的分组。

Conclusion: 给出在消费者分析中使用符号和拓扑方法的实用指导，认为结合两者的混合方法在未来应用中潜力大。

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

Motivation: 均值漂移算法收敛性的严格证明未知，此前文献[Gh1]、[Gh2]、[YT]有部分结果，本文旨在进一步推广。

Method: 利用Schoenberg和Bernstein对径向对称正定光滑核的两种刻画，并借鉴文献[Gh1]的证明步骤。

Result: 证明对于足够大带宽，任意径向对称且严格正定核的均值漂移算法在任意维度收敛。

Conclusion: 结果虽比文献[YT]更具限制性，但采用了不同假设和证明技术。

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

Conclusion: 对于轻尾或γ>3的多项式尾目标分布，重要性回火可提高时间平均估计量的精度并减少预烧期需求。

Abstract: We make two closely related theoretical contributions to the use of
importance sampling schemes. First, for independent sampling, we prove that the
minimax optimal trial distribution coincides with the target if and only if the
target distribution has no atom with probability greater than $1/2$, where
"minimax" means that the worst-case asymptotic variance of the self-normalized
importance sampling estimator is minimized. When a large atom exists, it should
be downweighted by the trial distribution. A similar phenomenon holds for a
continuous target distribution concentrated on a small set. Second, we argue
that it is often advantageous to run the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with a
tempered stationary distribution, $\pi(x)^\beta$, and correct for the bias by
importance weighting. The dynamics of this "importance-tempered" sampling
scheme can be described by a continuous-time Markov chain. We prove that for
one-dimensional targets with polynomial tails, $\pi(x) \propto (1 +
|x|)^{-\gamma}$, this chain is uniformly ergodic if and only if $1/\gamma <
\beta < (\gamma - 2)/\gamma$. These results suggest that for target
distributions with light or polynomial tails of order $\gamma > 3$, importance
tempering can improve the precision of time-average estimators and essentially
eliminate the need for burn-in.

Conclusion: 所提方法在有限数据新场景下可有效实现基于雷达的ECG恢复。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦中断信道下优化令牌分组，提出SemPA - Look框架，实验表明其能在保证分数的同时大幅降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 令牌通信中令牌间相互依赖，使得中断信道下单个令牌丢失会严重扭曲消息语义，需优化令牌分组。

Method: 提出语义分组聚合与前瞻搜索框架SemPA - Look，引入残差语义分数RSS，采用前瞻搜索启发式算法。

Result: 在远程AIGC任务实验中，SemPA - Look达到与穷举搜索相当的ATS和LPIPS分数，计算复杂度最高降低40倍，比遗传算法等线性复杂度算法低10倍。

Conclusion: SemPA - Look对远程AIGC和其他令牌通信应用具有实用性。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

TL;DR: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法及NAADA网络用于增强牙科全景X光片，比现有方法能更好恢复细节，提升图像质量和诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积去噪自编码器在恢复高频细节上有局限，传统注意力方法易忽略噪声区域特征，而牙科X光片需保留细微结构。

Method: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法，并构建噪声感知注意力增强去噪自编码器（NAADA）网络。

Result: 与Uformer、MResDNN等先进方法相比，更好地重建了精细细节。

Conclusion: 所提方法提升了图像质量和诊断准确性。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

Result: 模型能达到与其他先进模型相似的配准精度，推理时间大幅缩短，应变值计算结果一致。

Conclusion: 所提快速轻量级配准模型FLIR在心脏图像配准和应变量化方面表现良好。

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

Result: 在128个CT病例上，仅需少量代码就显著提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: 所提方法简单有效，能提升训练稳定性、收敛速度和重建性能。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的应用，需提升预填充效率。

Method: 将输入划分为带共享接收器的块级段，保留全注意力位置嵌入，对齐注意力权重以模拟全注意力分布。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，相比现有推理高效方法，准确率最高提升8.37%，注意力计算速度最高提升7.47倍，端到端延迟降低40%，严格延迟约束下准确率从23.26%提升到61.03%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中有效，适合自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 实时目标检测与深度OCR结合在智能交通系统中可行，可提供可扩展的车辆碳排放监测解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上实验，显著优于现有逐点和分段方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理复杂拓扑，在不依赖大量先验结构知识下保持全局路径连贯性。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Conclusion: Damba - ST保留了Mamba线性复杂度优势，增强了对异构域的适应性，可在新城市环境中无缝部署。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

Conclusion: HAWAII框架能以最小计算开销继承多个专家的互补优势，有效解决多视觉专家计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Motivation: 探究VLMs推断情感依赖的视觉线索，以及这些线索是否有心理学依据。

Method: 在AffectNet数据集的牙齿注释子集上对不同规模的VLMs进行基准测试，对表现最佳的GPT - 4o进行结构化内省。

Result: 发现模型表现随牙齿可见性有一致变化，眉毛位置等面部属性驱动情感推理，其效价 - 唤醒预测有高度内部一致性。

Conclusion: 凸显了FMs行为的涌现性，也揭示了快捷学习、偏差和公平性等风险。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动检测航空影像中小而稀有的野生动物对保护工作至关重要，但现有检测方法在应对草原犬鼠等物种时存在不足。

Method: 提出RareSpot框架，集成多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强。多尺度一致性利用特征金字塔的结构对齐，上下文感知增强将难检测样本嵌入真实环境。

Result: 在专家标注的草原犬鼠无人机影像基准上达到了最先进的性能，检测准确率比基线方法提高了35%以上，且能有效泛化到其他野生动物数据集。

Conclusion: RareSpot框架支持生态监测，为复杂航空场景中检测小而稀有物种奠定了新基础。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Motivation: CT检查需求增长引发诊断错误担忧，MLLMs存在信息不准确问题，现有医学VQA基准缺乏临床相关性和专家级知识评估。

Result: 定量评估显示不同模型在不同错误类型上能力有显著差异。

Conclusion: 该基准有助于开发更可靠和临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误，提高临床实践准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型处理长视频因高内存和计算成本难以兼顾性能和效率。

Method: 提出Video - XL - 2模型，采用基于任务感知的KV稀疏化，有分块预填充和双层键值解码两步。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中达最优，能在单GPU处理大量帧且耗时短。

Conclusion: Video - XL - 2在长视频理解中成本效益高，效果和效率表现好。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized

Conclusion: 提出的LM - AD和AQM有效解决了现有方法的局限性，能更好地完成3D点云的可及性检测任务。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感技术发展，对准确高效语义分割需求增加，现有方法面临计算效率和多尺度特征融合挑战。

Method: 提出GLCANet框架，采用双流架构融合全局语义和局部细节，使用自注意力机制增强长距离依赖，用掩码交叉注意力机制自适应融合全局 - 局部特征。

Result: GLCANet在精度和计算效率上优于现有方法，能以小内存处理大尺寸高分辨率图像。

Conclusion: GLCANet为实际遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Conclusion: 分层地图和双记忆模块不可或缺，代码开源

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Result: 通过KID分析表明合成数据集与真实图像分布差距显著降低；预训练EDM2模型FID降低11%，自编码器重建误差降低20%，ViT - S模型在ImageNet - 100分类准确率提升超10%。

Conclusion: 为缺乏足够大真实训练集时训练实用模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and

Result: 能有效减少伪影，保留解剖结构，生成高质量MVCT样重建结果，经定性和定量评估验证。

Conclusion: 该方法可缩小kVCT和MVCT差距，使肿瘤学家仅依靠kVCT，减少患者辐射暴露。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Conclusion: 在常见计算资源约束下开发特定领域基础模型时，应避免过度追求方法创新。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱影像云覆盖影响早期作物测绘，合成孔径雷达数据缺乏光谱细节，需解决多云区域多光谱数据重建问题。

Method: 提出时间序列ViT框架，利用多光谱影像时间连贯性和合成孔径雷达互补信息，通过注意力机制重建多云区域多光谱数据。

Result: 使用严格重建评估指标的综合实验表明，时间序列ViT框架明显优于不使用时间序列多光谱和合成孔径雷达或不使用合成孔径雷达的时间序列多光谱的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间序列ViT框架能有效增强多云区域多光谱影像重建效果。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击可使人脸识别系统在特定触发器激活时异常，威胁其在高安全应用中的适用性，需检测和识别此类攻击。

Method: 提出一种新技术，用于检测人脸识别网络是否被自然、物理可实现的触发器攻击，并在网络受损时识别此类触发器。

Result: 在受损人脸识别网络中，能以74%的前5准确率识别触发器，而简单暴力基线准确率为56%。

Conclusion: 所提技术在检测和识别自然触发器的后门攻击方面有效。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Result: VideoPCDNet在多个合成数据集上，无监督跟踪和预测性能优于多个目标中心基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoPCDNet能实现准确的无监督目标跟踪和未来视频帧预测，学习到可解释的对象和运动表示。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

Result: 在五名志愿者左右颈部区域图像上验证了基于场景图的图像解释和扫描指导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力通过提升超声对普通用户的可解释性和可用性，最大程度地实现超声的普及。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel

variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

TL;DR: 提出可分解流匹配（DFM）框架用于视觉媒体渐进生成，提升视觉质量且收敛快，架构简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维视觉模态生成计算量大，现有扩散模型较少采用显式多阶段架构且存在复杂度高的问题。

Method: 在用户定义的多尺度表示的每个级别独立应用流匹配。

Result: 在图像和视频上提升视觉质量，在Imagenet - 1k 512px上FDD分数有显著提升，微调大模型时收敛更快。

Conclusion: DFM框架简单有效，用单个模型、架构简单且对现有训练管道修改少就能实现诸多优势。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 ML - NIDS 检测多种攻击变种能力不确定，依赖同质数据集虚增性能，且依赖人类专业知识影响泛化能力，需改进。

Method: 提出 KnowML 框架，利用大语言模型自动分析攻击实现，构建攻击策略知识图，应用符号推理生成知识图增强输入。

Result: 在 28 种现实攻击变种上评估，基线模型 F1 分数低至 0%，KnowML 框架 F1 分数高达 99%，误报率低于 0.1%。

Conclusion: KnowML 框架能有效提升 ML - NIDS 检测多种攻击变种的能力。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (ML-NIDS), their capability to detect diverse attack variants
remains uncertain. Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,
which artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of
security. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack
variants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to
depend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of
system designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to
generalize across diverse attack types.
  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided
machine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML
systematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It
constructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it
applies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain
knowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.
  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly
collected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail
to detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %. In
contrast, our knowledge-guided approach achieves up to 99 % F1 score while
maintaining a False Positive Rate below 0.1 %.

Method: 分析六种对抗知识场景，提出三种攻击向量，通过系统评估攻击实例；提出结构噪声注入防御机制并在多种配置中验证。

Result: 不同攻击向量在完整知识条件下有不同成功率；80%现实部分知识场景攻击有效；结构噪声注入可额外降低攻击。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑是联邦学习系统的基本隐私漏洞，拓扑感知防御机制可缓解问题。

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: 可以使用通用分类器和低成本计算的账户特征来检测进化的机器人账号。

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

Motivation: 用户使用大语言模型作为个人代理时，面临将隐私数据发送给非信任大模型提供商增加风险，或使用本地较弱模型的两难问题，需解决此差距。

Method: 先将通用非隐私查询发送给强大非信任大模型生成CoT提示和子查询，再用同态加密向量数据库对用户私人数据进行加密语义搜索，最后将CoT提示和解密记录输入本地语言模型生成最终响应。

Result: 在LoCoMo长上下文QA基准上，结合GPT - 4o和本地Llama - 3.2 - 1B模型的混合框架比单独使用GPT - 4o性能最高提升7.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 该框架是向任务分解并在非信任强大LLM和本地弱模型间分配的系统迈出的第一步，可保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

Conclusion: 指出当前研究的局限性，为未来研究方向提供了建议。

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot
be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data
processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature
extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.
We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,
and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed
works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the
art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

TL;DR: 本文指出先前恶意URL检测工作的不足，提出WebGuard++检测框架，实验表明其效果优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于URL+HTML特征融合的恶意URL检测工作存在不完整的URL建模、HTML图稀疏、单向分析和决策不透明等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出WebGuard++框架，包含跨尺度URL编码器、子图感知HTML编码器、双向耦合模块和投票模块。

Result: WebGuard++在固定误报率下，真阳性率比现有基线高1.1 - 7.9倍。

Conclusion: WebGuard++检测框架能有效解决现有恶意URL检测工作的问题，提升检测效果。

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出特征差分隐私（FDP）框架，改进了传统差分隐私定义，能在保证隐私下提升模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私在特定机器学习应用中会造成不必要的效用损失，需要更灵活的隐私保护框架。

Method: 精确定义FDP，证明其性质，修改DP - SGD算法以满足FDP，并应用于机器学习任务。

Result: FDP能显著提升DP训练模型的效用，如在AFHQ数据集上训练扩散模型时FID大幅改善。

Conclusion: FDP提供了一种新的私有数据分析方法，可降低DP的效用成本并提供强隐私保证。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

Result: 在理论空间的研究区域验证方法，拓展到新的对称群。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合物理软件反馈的方法可用于中微子味理论，未来或可用于其他理论模型构建问题。

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning
with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical
model-building problems in the future.

Abstract: Network cascade refers to diffusion processes in which outcome changes within
part of an interconnected population trigger a sequence of changes across the
entire network. These cascades are governed by underlying diffusion networks,
which are often latent. Inferring such networks is critical for understanding
cascade pathways, uncovering Granger causality of interaction mechanisms among
individuals, and enabling tasks such as forecasting or maximizing information
propagation. In this project, we propose a novel double mixture directed graph
model for inferring multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data. The
proposed model represents cascade pathways as a mixture of diffusion networks
across different layers, effectively capturing the strong heterogeneity present
in real-world cascades. Additionally, the model imposes layer-specific
structural constraints, enabling diffusion networks at different layers to
capture complementary cascading patterns at the population level. A key
advantage of our model is its convex formulation, which allows us to establish
both statistical and computational guarantees for the resulting diffusion
network estimates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the
model's performance in recovering diverse diffusion structures. Finally, we
apply the proposed method to analyze cascades of research topics in the social
sciences across U.S. universities, revealing the underlying diffusion networks
of research topic propagation among institutions.

Conclusion: phylo2vec软件包为生物信息学界提供了一种高性能、易操作的系统发育树分析工具。

Abstract: Phylogenetics is a fundamental component of many analysis frameworks in
biology as well as linguistics to study the evolutionary relationships of
different entities. Recently, the advent of large-scale genomics and the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the necessity for phylogenetic software to
handle large datasets of genomes or phylogenetic trees. While significant
efforts have focused on scaling optimisation algorithms, visualization, and
lineage identification, an emerging body of research has been dedicated to
efficient representations of data for genomes and phylogenetic trees such as
phylo2vec. Compared to traditional tree representations such as the Newick
format, which represents trees using strings of nested parentheses, modern
representations of phylogenetic trees utilize integer vectors to define the
tree topology traversal. This approach offers several advantages, including
easier manipulability, increased memory efficiency, and applicability to
downstream tasks such as machine learning. Here, we present the latest release
of phylo2vec (or Phylo2Vec), a high-performance software package for encoding,
manipulating, and analysing binary phylogenetic trees. At its core, the package
is based on the phylo2vec representation of binary trees, which defines a
bijection from any tree topology with $n$ leaves into an integer vector of size
$n-1$. Compared to the traditional Newick format, phylo2vec is designed to
enable fast sampling and comparison of binary trees. This release features a
core implementation in Rust, providing significant performance improvements and
memory efficiency, while remaining available in Python (superseding the release
described in the original paper) and R via dedicated wrappers, making it
accessible to a broad audience in the bioinformatics community.

Conclusion: 该架构有潜力成为分子构象生成模型新类别基础。

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

Conclusion: Kling - Foley是一个有效的视频转音频生成模型，能实现高质量音频合成及良好的视听同步。

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

Result: 在小蛋白质上验证，基于流的内核仅从构象样本就能生成高质量粗粒化力。

Conclusion: 基于归一化流的内核能大幅减少局部失真，同时保持全局构象准确性。

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger

limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw
insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a
viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the
instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve
the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the
Mori--Zwanzig formalism.

Conclusion: 在对手从Kullback - Leibler分布不确定性集合中选择先验的重要情况下，计算DRBC最优策略的方法大大简化。

Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility
maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift
of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the
posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly.
However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and
the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy
performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a
distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the
controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence
neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in
economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization
settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation.
Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are
able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our
numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a
result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal
strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly
simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a
prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.

Conclusion: 基于优化的公式为矩阵序列化扩展到数据科学新领域提供了通用基础。

Abstract: Matrix seriation, the problem of permuting the rows and columns of a matrix
to uncover latent structure, is a fundamental technique in data science,
particularly in the visualization and analysis of relational data. Applications
span clustering, anomaly detection, and beyond. In this work, we present a
unified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix
seriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages
combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives
and constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional
heuristic methods and exact solution techniques.
  We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based
stress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized
counterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann
neighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that
enables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the
reordered matrix.
  To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set
of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly
curated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation
literature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not
only enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile
foundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.

Result: 能获得依赖改进条件数的线性收敛率，可能显著提升整体运行时间，且方法更易实现。

Conclusion: 使用稀疏更新可解决现有方法不足，有更好的运行时间和实现便利性。

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

Motivation: 现有多语言编程支持方法存在成本与性能难以兼顾的问题，需要新架构平衡效率与专业性。

Method: 引入MoLE架构，由基础模型、共享LoRA模块和特定语言LoRA模块组成，联合优化模块并在推理时自动路由。

Result: MoLE比训练单独特定语言LoRAs有更高的参数效率，在准确率上优于单共享LLM微调模型。

Conclusion: MoLE架构能有效平衡多语言编程的效率和专业性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: Nowadays, the main advances in computational power are due to parallelism.
However, most parallel languages have been designed with a focus on processors
and threads. This makes dealing with data and memory in programs hard, which
distances the implementation from its original algorithm. We propose a new
paradigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, where
computation is performed by autonomous data elements. Programs in this paradigm
are focused on making the data collaborate in a highly parallel fashion. We
furthermore present AuDaLa, the first data autonomous programming language, and
provide a full formalisation that includes a type system and operational
semantics. Programming in AuDaLa is very natural, as illustrated by examples,
albeit in a style very different from sequential and contemporary parallel
programming. Additionally, it lends itself for the formal verification of
parallel programs, which we demonstrate.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Motivation: 阈值逻辑门（TLGs）线性特性限制分类能力，需要网络完成复杂任务，希望找到提升分类性能的方法。

Method: 提出广义TLG模型receptron，研究其在3D空间立方域内模拟输入的特性，并将模型扩展到n维。

Result: 证明receptron在3D空间立方域内对模拟输入具有内在选择性激活特性，且模型可扩展到n维。

Conclusion: 基于receptron的网络是一类新设备，适用于需要高选择性和分类能力、无需复杂训练的边缘应用。

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模整个大气层对于理解重力波向上传播、影响高层大气动力学及各层耦合至关重要，需要高精度且高效的模型。

Method: 利用球形傅里叶神经算子（SFNO）捕捉全球尺度大气动力学，基于WACCM - X数据集训练；引入模块化架构分离示踪剂预测和核心动力学。

Result: CAM - NET精度与WACCM - X相当，推理时间加快超1000倍，几分钟可完成一年模拟；在O²示踪剂验证中表现良好。

Conclusion: CAM - NET能准确高效预测大气变量，其模块化架构可低成本适应特定示踪剂场景，有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓宽文献[104]中完全提升统计插值机制的适用范围，研究更难的非典型随机结构特征。

Method: 对文献[104]的比较进行大偏差升级。

Result: 新机制拓宽了适用范围，可研究非典型随机结构特征，结果与局部熵有联系，插值形式有优雅表达式。

Conclusion: 所得结果适用于文献[104]讨论的所有随机结构，提供了便于进一步研究的工具。

Abstract: [104] introduced a powerful \emph{fully lifted} (fl) statistical
interpolating mechanism. It established a nested connection between blirps
(bilinearly indexed random processes) and their decoupled (linearly indexed)
comparative counterparts. We here revisit the comparison from [104] and
introduce its a \emph{large deviation} upgrade. The new machinery allows to
substantially widen the [104]'s range of applicability. In addition to
\emph{typical}, studying analytically much harder \emph{atypical} random
structures features is now possible as well. To give a bit of a practical
flavor, we show how the obtained results connect to the so-called \emph{local
entropies} (LE) and their predicated role in understanding solutions clustering
and associated \emph{computational gaps} in hard random optimization problems.
As was the case in [104], even though the technical considerations often appear
as fairly involved, the final interpolating forms admit elegant expressions
thereby providing a relatively easy to use tool readily available for further
studies. Moreover, as the considered models encompass all well known random
structures discussed in [104], the obtained results automatically apply to them
as well.

Result: 引入的机制拓展了[103]的适用范围，涵盖非典型特征如局部熵。发现的基本插值参数关系形式优雅。

Conclusion: 所引入机制及发现的参数关系是有价值的工具，可进一步应用。

Abstract: We consider \emph{bilinearly indexed random processes} (blirp) and study
their interpolating comparative mechanisms. Generic introduction of the
\emph{fully lifted} (fl) blirp interpolation in [105] was followed by a
corresponding stationarization counterpart in [103]. A \emph{large deviation}
upgrade of [105] introduced in companion paper [106] is complemented here with
the corresponding one of [103]. Similarly to [106], the mechanism that we
introduce extends the range of [103]'s applicability so that it encompasses
random structures \emph{atypical} features. Among others these include the
\emph{local entropies} (LE) which explain atypical solutions clusterings in
hard random optimization problems believed to be directly responsible for the
presumable existence of the so-called \emph{computational gaps}. Moreover (and
similar to [105]), despite on occasion somewhat involved technical
considerations, the final forms of the uncovered fundamental interpolating
parameters relations are rather elegant and as such provide a valuable tool
readily available for further use.

Result: 在噪声量子数据任务中优于量子卷积神经网络，在经典图像分类基准中表现与经典神经网络相当。

Conclusion: IQFMs为解决当前量子增强机器学习的限制、发挥其潜力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Method: 将QEL与COM结合，构建混合算法COM - QEL。

Result: 在基准优化任务上，COM - QEL能可靠找到具有更高真实目标值的解决方案。

Conclusion: COM - QEL在离线设计问题上优于原始QEL。

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion - MNIST和CIFAR - 10上保留局部结构更有效，抗攻击能力强，下游分类任务准确率和F1分数超99%，在真实硬件和噪声模拟器测试有抗噪潜力。

Conclusion: qPGA是推进量子机器学习应用的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population
activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven
models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can
struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations,
leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we
introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS),
a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional
communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population
dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying
communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region
networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts
brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model
fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS
as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information
processing.

Conclusion: 指出主要挑战与机遇，为未来自动抑郁评估研究提供方向。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Motivation: 现有广泛采用的稀疏数据存储格式为文本格式，存在文件大、解析慢的问题，且缺乏跨平台二进制格式。

Method: 提出Binsparse格式规范，包含JSON描述符和二进制数组，提供多语言、框架和容器的参考实现。

Result: Binsparse HDF5 CSR格式无压缩时文件大小平均减少2.4倍，压缩时减少7.5倍；读写性能相比Matrix Market解析器有显著提升。

Conclusion: Binsparse是一种有效的跨平台二进制稀疏矩阵和张量存储格式。

Abstract: Sparse matrices and tensors are ubiquitous throughout multiple subfields of
computing. The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and
on-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are
the Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to
the inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes
and longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an
in-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse
computation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix
to disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is
common practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable
binary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently
no cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a
cross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse
is a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which
describes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of
binary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as
HDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse
spanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our
Binsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a
selection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format
shows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with
compression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a
state-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read
speedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write
speedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,

Result: 在数学和代码完成基准测试中，DUS比基于并行置信度的规划器分数更高，且减少去噪器调用次数。

Conclusion: DUS为高效高质量文本生成提供轻量级、预算友好的方法，有助于释放MDLM真正能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

TL;DR: 为解决预训练扩展的数据墙问题，提出REWIRE方法，通过丰富低质量文档增加合成数据表示，实验证明其有效且优于相关方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练依赖网络爬取数据，但自然数据增长慢且高质量文本有限，存在“数据墙”问题。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，即Recycling the Web with guIded REwrite，对现有过滤过程中丢弃的数据进行转换和回收，丰富低质量文档。

Result: 在DCLM基准的不同规模实验中，混合高质量原始文本和重写文本比仅用过滤网络数据有提升，且优于获取2倍网络数据，约82%混合文本来自低质量文档转换，REWIRE优于相关合成数据方法。

Conclusion: 回收网络文本是一种简单有效的扩展预训练数据的方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体发展使有害内容传播加剧，有害模因检测因语义隐含和多模态交互复杂面临挑战，缺乏系统、大规模、多样且高可解释性的数据集阻碍领域发展。

Method: 引入MemeMind数据集，提出MemeGuard检测框架，将多模态信息与推理过程建模有效结合。

Result: 在MemeMind数据集上的大量实验显示，MemeGuard在有害模因检测任务中始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind数据集为有害模因检测提供坚实基础，MemeGuard检测框架能有效提升模型理解和识别有害模因的能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

Motivation: 大语言模型响应存在固有偏差，现有评估方法忽视长文本响应偏差和输出的内在可变性。

Method: 提出FiSCo框架，在声明级别操作，利用蕴含检查评估响应含义一致性，分解模型输出并进行统计假设检验。

Result: FiSCo能更可靠地识别细微偏差，降低随机可变性影响，优于各种评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo是一种有效的评估大语言模型群体公平性的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

Result: 多数模型在世界建模任务上表现优于心智理论任务，对人类推理表现更好，发现模型存在启发式行为。

Conclusion: StorySim框架可有效评估大语言模型能力，代码开源可获取。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Result: 在日语和中文咨询场景实验中，EmoStage提升了基础模型回复质量，与数据驱动方法表现相当。

Conclusion: EmoStage框架能有效增强共情回复生成，有一定应用价值。

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Method: 使用Mamba（一种选择性状态空间模型），整合语音特征和提示策略。

Result: 在speechocean762基准上的一系列实验表明，模型始终优于先前方法，在MDD任务上表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一框架能有效提升CAPT中APA和MDD的性能。

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Result: 框架有效检测出先前方法遗漏的角色不一致，分析揭示任务结构和角色吸引力对模型适应性的影响。

Conclusion: 所提框架能更精确、现实地评估角色保真度，指出保持一致角色表达存在挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上的评估表明框架在黑盒设置中有效且优越。

Conclusion: VeilProbe能在无人工干预的黑盒场景下有效检测大语言模型预训练文本。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

Conclusion: 强调评估和改进大语言模型标注器在分歧建模方面的迫切需求。

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Conclusion: RCStat能有效利用原始注意力对数，在键值压缩和归因应用中有出色表现。

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型推理链可能无效的问题，提出ECCoT框架提升其可解释性、减少偏差并增强决策可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型缺乏透明度、输出不可靠，推理链存在无效问题，需要评估和完善推理链。

Method: 提出ECCoT框架，集成MRF - ETM进行主题感知的思维链生成，使用CSBert进行因果推理对齐，用结构化排序统计过滤无效链。

Result: ECCoT框架提高了大语言模型的可解释性，减少了偏差，增强了基于大语言模型决策的可信度。

Conclusion: ECCoT框架、MRF - ETM和CSBert的引入对大语言模型推理链的优化有积极作用，代码已开源。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language

efficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly
between dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient
needs. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster
behavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms
a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit
of conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals.

Result: SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达59.1%，比零RL方法高9.0%；在三个分布外基准测试中高10.9%。

Conclusion: SRFT能有效结合SFT和RL，在推理任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Continued adoption of agricultural robots postulates the farmer's trust in
the reliability, robustness and safety of the new technology. This motivates
our work on safety assurance of agricultural robots, particularly their ability
to detect, track and avoid obstacles and humans. This paper considers a
probabilistic modelling and risk analysis framework for use in the early
development phases. Starting off with hazard identification and a risk
assessment matrix, the behaviour of the mobile robot platform, sensor and
perception system, and any humans present are captured using three state
machines. An auto-generated probabilistic model is then solved and analysed
using the probabilistic model checker PRISM. The result provides unique insight
into fundamental development and engineering aspects by quantifying the effect
of the risk mitigation actions and risk reduction associated with distinct
design concepts. These include implications of adopting a higher performance
and more expensive Object Detection System or opting for a more elaborate
warning system to increase human awareness. Although this paper mainly focuses
on the initial concept-development phase, the proposed safety assurance
framework can also be used during implementation, and subsequent deployment and
operation phases.

Result: 该方法可有效验证安全关键属性，有助于早期发现设计问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于开发更安全的机器人和自主系统。

Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural
settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability
and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured
environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide
range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the
safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire
development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification.
The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk
assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety
requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to
capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified
safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is
demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results
show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical
properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues,
contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.

Method: 提出基于新颖影响函数理论公式的CUPID方法，根据评估轨迹估计每个训练演示对策略预期回报的影响，进行数据筛选。

Result: 在模拟和硬件实验中，使用不到33%的筛选数据可在模拟基准上产生先进扩散策略，还能识别分布偏移下的鲁棒策略等。

Conclusion: CUPID方法能有效识别驱动测试时性能的数据，提升机器人策略性能。

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

Motivation: 开发能在高度随机环境中实现高性能的双臂机器人操作的扩散策略框架。

Method: 集成三项创新，包括Simulator - Supervised Semantic Segmentation、Task - Conditioned Feature Encoders、Affordance - Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision，在大规模程序生成的模拟数据上训练。

Conclusion: 该框架与RoboTwin实到虚管道集成，有望从场景和指令中完全自主生成可部署的视觉运动策略，消除学习操作技能时对人类示范的依赖。

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

Abstract: In forecast reconciliation, the covariance matrix of the base forecasts
errors plays a crucial role. Typically, this matrix is estimated, and then
treated as known. In contrast, we propose a Bayesian reconciliation model that
explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in the covariance matrix. We choose an
Inverse-Wishart prior, which leads to a multivariate-t reconciled predictive
distribution and allows a completely analytical derivation. Empirical
experiments demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of the
prediction intervals with respect to MinT, leading to more reliable
probabilistic forecasts.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Educational disparities are rooted in and perpetuate social inequalities
across multiple dimensions such as race, socioeconomic status, and geography.
To reduce disparities, most intervention strategies focus on a single domain
and frequently evaluate their effectiveness by using causal decomposition
analysis. However, a growing body of research suggests that single-domain
interventions may be insufficient for individuals marginalized on multiple
fronts. While interventions across multiple domains are increasingly proposed,
there is limited guidance on appropriate methods for evaluating their
effectiveness. To address this gap, we develop an extended causal decomposition
analysis that simultaneously targets multiple causally ordered intervening
factors, allowing for the assessment of their synergistic effects. These
scenarios often involve challenges related to model misspecification due to
complex interactions among group categories, intervening factors, and their
confounders with the outcome. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a
triply robust estimator that leverages machine learning techniques to address
potential model misspecification. We apply our method to a cohort of students
from the High School Longitudinal Study, focusing on math achievement
disparities between Black, Hispanic, and White high schoolers. Specifically, we
examine how two sequential interventions - equalizing the proportion of
students who attend high-performing schools and equalizing enrollment in
Algebra I by 9th grade across racial groups - may reduce these disparities.

Conclusion: 财富热化假说可有效描述财富分布，且会导致社会不平等，还简单探讨了减少不平等的可能措施。

Abstract: We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the
wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the
Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system
wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional
parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range
determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there
is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical
systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor
households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant
fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society.
We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of
Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500
companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction
are briefly discussed.

TL;DR: 本文针对大语言模型在教育中的应用问题，提出教学提示概念并开发学习干预方案，评估显示能提升学生技能与态度，且方法可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生滥用大语言模型影响学习成果的问题，教学生有效使用大语言模型提升学习效果。

Method: 提出教学提示概念，以本科早期计算机科学教育为背景，通过对教师的调查确定教学设计，开发交互式学习系统进行教学干预，用前后测评估效果。

Result: 学习者基于大语言模型的教学求助技能显著提高，对系统态度积极，未来使用教学提示的意愿增加。

Conclusion: 提出教学提示理论框架，了解教师态度，设计的学习干预方案有良好效果，方法可在课堂广泛应用，有望集成到ChatGPT等工具中。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Motivation: 推进用户隐私和信任方面的研究。

Method: 采用规则过滤、迭代人工标注与审核、有针对性的数据增强、基于Transformer分类器的弱监督等策略，还手动标注7000条评论用于模型开发和评估。

Result: 对多种分类模型进行基准测试，证明可取得良好性能。

Conclusion: 发布HARPT作为公共资源，支持健康信息学、网络安全和自然语言处理领域的研究。

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store
reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset
comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a
baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support
work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文介绍多模态可访问性多智能体系统MATE，可按需进行模态转换，还引入ModCon - Task - Identifier模型，实验显示其性能出色，代码和数据公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统因闭源设计缺乏定制性，无法为有需求用户提供全面帮助，残障人士与数字环境交互存在障碍。

Method: 引入多模态可访问性多智能体系统MATE进行模态转换，支持多种模型；引入ModCon - Task - Identifier模型提取模态转换任务。

Result: ModCon - Task - Identifier在自定义数据上始终优于其他大语言模型和统计模型。

Conclusion: MATE系统可应用于多领域，能适应不同需求，确保信息隐私安全，可与机构技术集成。

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨知识产权规则对跨境贸易的实际影响。

Method: 基于三十年证据进行回顾，借助微观数据和TRIPS后的准自然实验。

Result: 更强知识产权权利有市场力量和动态激励，常促进贸易广延边际，引导部分活动转向许可和外资。

Conclusion: 政策捆绑和测量差距影响因果推断，未来要关注无形流动和执法质量以适应国际商务前沿。

Abstract: Intellectual property (IP) rules have the potential to shape cross-border
trade far more than their legalistic origins might suggest. Drawing on three
decades of evidence, this review shows that stronger IP rights simultaneously
create market-power forces that raise prices and market-expansion forces that
broaden demand, while dynamic incentives spur quality upgrading and new export
varieties. Micro-data and quasi-natural experiments after TRIPS reveal that IP
most often boosts trade along the extensive margin and redirects some activity
toward licensing and foreign investment. Policy bundling and measurement gaps
on the strength of IP rights still cloud causal inference. Future work must map
intangible flows and enforcement quality to capture the digital, data-driven
frontier of international commerce.

Motivation: 检验理性信息获取理论在新冠疫苗信息这一现实场景中的预测情况。

Method: 在台湾进行线上实验，让受试者选择新冠疫苗信息并更新对疫苗有效性和偏好的信念。

Result: 人们的信息获取总体符合理性理论框架预测，所选信息更能改变其信念，还会影响疫苗偏好和选择。

Conclusion: 受试者遵循理性信息获取框架。

Abstract: Rational information acquisition theory predicts that people select the more
informative information. Thus, people's beliefs will be more persuaded by the
information they select. We test the prediction in a critical real-world
context -- information about COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted an online
experiment in Taiwan where the subjects selected information about COVID-19
vaccines, and then the subjects updated their beliefs about vaccine
effectiveness and references to vaccines. As our design distinguishes different
stages of the rational acquisition framework, it allows us to diagnose the
underlying mechanism of the theory. Our empirical findings demonstrate evidence
that people's information acquisition generally coheres with the rational
theory framework predictions; that is, people choose information when the
information is more likely to alter their decisions. We show that our subjects'
beliefs change more when they see the information they select. We also find
evidence of change in vaccine preferences and choices after they receive the
information they select, which further suggests that the subjects follow the
rational information acquisition framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染等随机干扰可能影响认知表现，尤其在高风险场景下，研究其对波兰学校毕业考试成绩的短期影响。

Method: 利用连续三年考试日空气污染的随机变化，加入学校和时间固定效应，使用学校层面面板数据，结合局部和远距离聚合的空气污染测量方法。

Result: PM2.5和PM10浓度每增加一个标准差，学生考试成绩约降低0.07 - 0.08个标准差，结果的大小和显著性与空气污染读数的位置和时间有关，且空气污染影响随考试成绩分布分位数上升而增加。

Conclusion: 局部空气污染测量很重要，需区分同期和滞后影响，高能力学生更易受空气污染随机干扰的影响。

Abstract: Random disturbances such as air pollution may affect cognitive performance,
which, particularly in high-stakes settings, may have severe consequences for
an individual's productivity and well-being. This paper examines the short-term
effects of air pollution on school leaving exam results in Poland. I exploit
random variation in air pollution between the days on which exams are held
across three consecutive school years. I aim to capture this random variation
by including school and time fixed effects. The school-level panel data is
drawn from a governmental program where air pollution is continuously measured
in the schoolyard. This localized hourly air pollution measure is a unique
feature of my study, which increases the precision of the estimated effects. In
addition, using distant and aggregated air pollution measures allows me for the
comparison of the estimates in space and time. The findings suggest that a one
standard deviation increase in the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5
and PM10 decreases students' exam scores by around 0.07-0.08 standard
deviations. The magnitude and significance of these results depend on the
location and timing of the air pollution readings, indicating the importance of
the localized air pollution measure and the distinction between contemporaneous
and lingering effects. Further, air pollution effects gradually increase in
line with the quantiles of the exam score distribution, suggesting that
high-ability students are more affected by the random disturbances caused by
air pollution.

Motivation: 现有预训练模型不支持全长环状eccDNA下游分析，现有基因组模型有分辨率或效率问题。

Method: 引入eccDNAMamba，结合正反传递进行全上下文表征学习，用新的增强策略保留环状结构。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上测试，eccDNAMamba分类性能强，能处理长达200 Kbp的序列。

Conclusion: eccDNAMamba为环状基因组建模提供了强大且高效的框架。

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream
analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide
resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

Result: 客观分数显示在多声源情况下所提技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的声源定位技术在多声源场景有更好的性能。

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

Method: 引入包含50名讲英语的印度人27.17小时真实和深度伪造音频的IndieFake Dataset，对其进行平衡数据分布和说话者级特征刻画，并与现有数据集对比评估。

Result: IndieFake Dataset在性能上优于ASVspoof21 (DF)，且比基准ITW数据集更具挑战性。

Conclusion: IndieFake Dataset有助于解决现有数据集不足，提升在多样语言和文化背景下检测音频深度伪造的能力。

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 当前生成图像模型在生成简单概念图像时有失败情况，需确定是异常还是结构性局限。

Method: 利用稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）提取可解释概念嵌入，训练含32000个概念的RA - SAE，对比真实和生成图像概念流行度。

Result: 揭示特定抑制和夸张的概念盲点，在个体数据点层面分离出记忆伪影。

Conclusion: 提出理论框架，可系统识别生成模型概念盲点，评估其概念保真度。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise
research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,
enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: CAI（ChatGPT）能提升大班级学生学习内容参与度，并探讨了研究结果的意义。

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.
