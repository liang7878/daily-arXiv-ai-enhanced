QMs, and more generally\nfeature map-based nonlinear corrections, augment linear dimensionality\nreduction with a nonlinear correction term in the reconstruction map to\novercome approximation accuracy limitations of purely linear approaches. While\nfeature map-based approaches typically learn a least-squares optimal polynomial\ncorrection term, we generalize this approach by learning an optimal nonlinear\ncorrection from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our approach\nallows one to impose arbitrary nonlinear structure on the correction term,\nincluding polynomial structure, and includes feature map and radial basis\nfunction-based corrections as special cases. Furthermore, our method has\nrelatively low training cost and has monotonically decreasing error as the\nlatent space dimension increases. We compare our approach to proper orthogonal\ndecomposition and several recent QM approaches on data from several example\nproblems."}

To address this need, we propose a novel query\ntype, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the\noptimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.\nAn individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the\nflexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,\nknown as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query\nidentifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and\ndetour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead\ndistance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user\nmust travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in\ntheir trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the\ntotal trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries\nincreases with the number of POIs.

A data center server can\nrun many multiserver jobs in parallel, as long as it has sufficient resources\nto meet their demands. However, multiserver jobs are generally stateful,\nmeaning that job preemptions incur significant overhead from saving and\nreloading the state associated with running jobs. Hence, most systems try to\navoid these costly job preemptions altogether. Given these constraints, a\nscheduling policy must determine what set of jobs to run in parallel at each\nmoment in time to minimize the mean response time across a stream of arriving\njobs. Unfortunately, simple non-preemptive policies such as FCFS may leave many\ncores idle, resulting in high mean response times or even system instability.\nOur goal is to design and analyze non-preemptive scheduling policies for\nmultiserver jobs that maintain high system utilization to achieve low mean\nresponse time.\n  One well-known non-preemptive policy, Most Servers First (MSF), prioritizes\njobs with higher core requirements and achieves high resource utilization.\nHowever, MSF causes extreme variability in job waiting times, and can perform\nsignificantly worse than FCFS in practice. To address this, we propose and\nanalyze a class of scheduling policies called MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ) that\nperforms well. MSFQ reduces the variability of job waiting times by\nperiodically granting priority to other jobs in the system. We provide both\nstability results and an analysis of mean response time under MSFQ to prove\nthat our policy dramatically outperforms MSF in the case where jobs request one\ncore or all the cores. In more complex cases, we evaluate MSFQ in simulation.\nWe show that, with some additional optimization, variants of the MSFQ policy\ncan greatly outperform MSF and FCFS on real-world multiserver job workloads."}

Advances\nin machine learning have enabled highly flexible functional forms for\nconditional means and volatilities, yet few models deliver interpretable\nstate--dependent tail risk, capture multiple forecast horizons and yield\ndistributions amenable to backtesting and execution. This paper proposes a\nneural L\\'evy jump--diffusion framework that jointly learns, as functions of\nobservable state variables, the conditional drift, diffusion, jump intensity\nand jump size distribution. We show how a single shared encoder yields multiple\nforecasting heads corresponding to distinct horizons (daily, weekly, etc.),\nfacilitating multi--horizon density forecasts and risk measures. The state\nvector includes conventional price and volume features as well as novel\ncomplexity measures such as permutation entropy and recurrence quantification\nanalysis determinism, which quantify predictability in the underlying process.\nEstimation is based on a quasi--maximum likelihood approach that separates\ndiffusion and jump contributions via bipower variation weights and incorporates\nmonotonicity and smoothness regularisation to ensure identifiability. A\ncost--aware portfolio optimiser translates the model's conditional densities\ninto implementable trading strategies under leverage, turnover and\nno--trade--band constraints. Extensive empirical analyses on cross--sectional\nequity data demonstrate improved calibration, sharper tail control and\neconomically significant risk reduction relative to baseline diffusive and\nGARCH benchmarks.

The results reveal that developed markets\npredominantly serve as net transmitters of volatility spillovers under normal\nconditions, but often transition into net receivers during episodes of systemic\nstress, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, developing markets display\nheightened instability in their spillover roles, frequently oscillating between\ntransmitter and receiver positions. Denoising not only clarifies the dynamic\nand heterogeneous nature of spillover channels, but also sharpens the alignment\nbetween observed spillover patterns and known financial events. These findings\nhighlight the necessity of denoising in spillover analysis for effective\nmonitoring of systemic risk and market interconnectedness."}

Recent studies have\nmade notable progress in enhancing the flexibility and intelligence of open\ndataset search, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong\npotential in addressing long-standing challenges in this area. Therefore, a\nsystematic and comprehensive review of the open dataset search problem is\nessential, detailing the current state of research and exploring future\ndirections. In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search\nbeyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords. From the\nperspective of dataset modalities, we place particular emphasis on\nexample-based dataset search, advanced similarity measurement techniques based\non dataset content, and efficient search acceleration techniques. In addition,\nwe emphasize the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and open dataset\nsearch. On the one hand, LLMs help address complex challenges in query\nunderstanding, semantic modeling, and interactive guidance within open dataset\nsearch. In turn, advances in dataset search can support LLMs by enabling more\neffective integration into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and\ndata selection processes, thereby enhancing downstream task performance.\nFinally, we summarize open research problems and outline promising directions\nfor future work. This work aims to offer a structured reference for researchers\nand practitioners in the field of open dataset search."}

Here, agents are instantiated\nwith emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual\naccuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually\nrepresented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of\nthree classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)\ndatasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving\nneighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with\nmovement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative\nemotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,\nemotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of\nexperiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and\nscenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy\nclassifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,\nemotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By\ncontrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional\nclusters and resilience to emotional disruptions.

These applications place higher demands on model compression\nand inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,\ndue to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs\nface challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies\nlearned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self\nAttention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier\nKAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.\nThrough the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift\nmechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves\nits nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational\ncomplexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based\non teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive\nweighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the\nstudent model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD\nachieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models\nand 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model.

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem.

We show that this kind of model can indeed recall\nthe specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small\nnumber of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not\ngeneralize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic\nlearning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall\ncapabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded\ngradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in\na limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated\nrepresentations as found in the hippocampus."}

However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory\nPrediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,\ntrajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs\n(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary\ndifficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future\ntrajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This\nresearch presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic\nmethodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem\nthrough metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic\nnature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both\nhistorical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an\nenvironmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric\ntransformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and\nmap inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)\nMap-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing\nobstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose\nprobabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability\ndistributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This\nstudy introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of\nmultimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model\nrobustness against input transformations and contextual changes without\nreliance on ground-truth trajectories."}

An MTD is a Markov chain in\nwhich the transition probabilities are expressed as a convex combination of\nlower-order conditional distributions. Despite their generality, inference for\nMTD models has traditionally been limited by the need to estimate\nhigh-dimensional joint distributions. In particular, for a sample of size n,\nthe feasible order d of the MTD is typically restricted to d approximately\nO(log n). To overcome this limitation, Ost and Takahashi (2023) recently\nintroduced a computationally efficient non-parametric inference method that\nidentifies the relevant lags in high-order MTD models, even when d is\napproximately O(n), provided that the set of relevant lags is sparse. In this\narticle, we introduce hdMTD, an R package allowing us to estimate parameters of\nsuch high-dimensional Markovian models. Given a sample from an MTD chain, hdMTD\ncan retrieve the relevant past set using the BIC algorithm or the forward\nstepwise and cut algorithm described in Ost and Takahashi (2023). The package\nalso computes the maximum likelihood estimate for transition probabilities and\nestimates high-order MTD parameters through the expectation-maximization\nalgorithm. Additionally, hdMTD also allows for simulating an MTD chain from its\nstationary invariant distribution using the perfect (exact) sampling algorithm,\nenabling Monte Carlo simulation of the model.

However, these architectures are susceptible to thermal\nvulnerabilities due to the inherent vertical adjacency that occurs during the\nmanufacturing process of HBM architectures. We anticipate that adversaries may\nexploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop\nthermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host\ndata/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary\nmanages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or\nlaterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that\nmaximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its\ndata/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any\nout-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests\nand the operating system's memory management policies. In other words, since\nthe attack mimics legitimate workloads, it will be challenging to detect."}

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem.

For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity.

However, the practical use of these\ntechniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's\nGeneral Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of\nsensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving\ncomputational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx\nalgorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian\nBasic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was\ntrained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its\nperformance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two\nmillion student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an\naccuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of\n61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust\nprivacy guarantee.

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination.

Our framework defines generic control and data structure\nschemas which are passed among independent software processes (components),\nwith the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific\ntranslator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for\nexperimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation\nlogic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple\noverride mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To\nvalidate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate\nmanufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction\ncomponent."}

Our approach first employs a twostep\nabstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model\nto distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create\ndiverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.\nSubsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a\ncomputationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which\nstochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and\nrobustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public\nOSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly\noutperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work\nvalidates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient\nalternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced\nclassification tasks.

As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the\nclient side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges\nfor training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first\nto easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,\nclient-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased\npatterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,\nthe curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic\nknowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves\nweighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained\nstructural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior\nperformance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight\ntwo major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the\nengineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,\nand the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search\nfor novel solutions."}

Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact\nremoval rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace\nReconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without\nincorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This\nwork proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation\nattention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU\ndata to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals.

We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions.

Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a\nSpherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of\nERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\\sigma}-levels. The model\nincorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates\nprescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere\ndynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces\nclimatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,\nincluding surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2\nconcentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as\nequatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,\nwhile showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite\nrequiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,\ntraining in under five hours on four GPUs.

We generalize this\nlearning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data\nReprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target\nattribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction\naccuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating\nhigh-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large\nsearch space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from\nutility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative\nlearning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to\ndiscover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any\nregard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq\nencoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and\nadversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals\nduring feature generation.

We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the\ntoken embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed\nand direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these\nfindings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that\nmodulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or\nenvironment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source\nVLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in\nsimulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5).

Without reliable\nuncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals\n(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a\nmeaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical\ndecision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from\nthe Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure\nwell-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and\nsupport for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that\nprediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula\ndistribution, enabling closed-form PI computation.

However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance\nand do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was\nFDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,\nwe present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an\nindividual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.\nUsing an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,\nwe trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI\nDINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a\npatient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out\ntest set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions\nwithin 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL\napproaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a\npromising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work."}

Our trained neural networks attain the\nminimax-optimal quantity of \\textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject\nto logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling\nassumed in classical UATs.\n  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world\nneural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting\nsub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and\nfavourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training\ndata, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial\nclustering attention layer).

In\naddition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all\nhistorical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to\nrecognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately.

For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns.

We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our\nproposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of\nAI-generated poetry."}

For instance,\nStable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a\n2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step\ndiffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on\nlarge, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often\ntoo costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These\nrequirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely\non full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation.

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two\nshortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on\nhigh-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,\nit does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which\nestimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data\ndistributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the\nprobability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,\nand by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates\nusing all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world\nevaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently\nimproves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only\nrequiring minor modifications."}

We identify two major challenges with RL in this\nsetting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,\nusing only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A\nprogram that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.\nTo address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial\ncredit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early\n(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static\nlanguage model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the\nagent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as\nreward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that\nperforming gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with\nRL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent\nscaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks."}

We develop a comprehensive scaling\nframework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth\ninitialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation\nto achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy\namong scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete\nmodel training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving\nover 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \\$0.70 per million\noutput tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we\nconduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted\nmid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further\naugmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers\nhighly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional\nstrengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is\nopen-sourced to foster community research.\n  LongCat Chat: https://longcat.ai\n  Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat\n  GitHub: https://github.com/meituan-longcat"}

Unfortunately, despite abundant\nprior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality\nis that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.\n  This \"open problem\" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific\nworks in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the\nbenchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in\nresearch. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails\nthat -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly\nencompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and\nre-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),\nincluding large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an\n(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such\nmethods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same\ndataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future\nresearch outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the\ncreation of \"more challenging benchmarks\" that reflect current phishing trends,\nwe propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate\nnovel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a\nnovel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three\nlanguages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a\nmuch lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating\na larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with\na user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still\nan open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future\nresearch."}

This paper proposes a novel approach\ninspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in\nDiscrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and\nexterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \\star_0^{-1} d_0^T \\star_1 d_0)$. We adjust\nthe Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the\nmulti-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\\star_0$,\n$\\star_1$ and $\\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act\non mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a\ncomputationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in\nmesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning\nframework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition\noperations or complex preprocessing operations."}

In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on\nagents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.\nWe start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that\nare asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning\ngates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate\nwith real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and\nenvironmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework."}

Many\nexisting methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding\nuncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain.\nFor instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume\nthe training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these\nlocations are often not even randomly sampled.

However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and\ndiversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data\nutility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation\nand data utility remains a critical challenge.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework\nfor the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on\ndata utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the\nupper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that\nperturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining\nfidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs\nlocal extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of\nindividual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted\nprivacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our\nmethod effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are\nvulnerable to MIA.

We survey emerging trends in datasets,\nscene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from\npassive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities.

However, little is known about the\nprocesses of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To\nfacilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present\narticle offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in\npsychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests\nupon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked\nto the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'\nontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially\nsanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment\noutcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human\ntherapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can\nemerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these\npropositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical\napplications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human\ntherapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of\nartificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish\nuniversally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these\ninterventions."}

This paper presents a novel,\nnoninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We\nintroduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet\nmodel deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When\ntrained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for\ncrying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency\nsuitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a\ncritical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and\ndiagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures\n(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational\ncost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates\nthree key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%\nreduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT\ncommunication for clinical alerts.

This study conducts a\ncomparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed\nmultilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models\n(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained\non code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained\non non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google\nGemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER\ntags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,\nparticularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform\nothers - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to\ndomain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show\nlimited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot\nperformance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study\nprovides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized\nmodels for code-mixed NER tasks."}

RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards\nto guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output\nquality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR\nparadigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from\nsparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in\nRL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\\textbf{PACS}$, a\nnovel RLVR framework that achieves im$\\textbf{P}$licit $\\textbf{A}$ctor\n$\\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By\ntreating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR\nproblem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by\nthe policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient\nanalysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the\nclassical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic\nroles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as\nPPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS\nachieves 59.78\\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32\nand 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a\npromising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and\ndata are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS."}

We challenge\nthis assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),\ntraining monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality\nhuman-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior\nperformance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the\ncomparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small\nmodel, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium\nmodel.

This creates a tension: while\npost-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions\nand reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and\nexploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We\naddress this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a\nframework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.\nAt its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure\ndiversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is\nthen combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,\nencouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.\nExperiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING\ngeneralizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and\ncreative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks\nin the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL\nbaselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and\nnovelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution\nquality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing\nfor diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as\nhigher-quality responses."}

Building on this\nfoundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational\nprocesses and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive\nmanagement through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing\nprecise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,\nmapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining\nscalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on\nthe creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and\ninter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)\nframework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,\nmerging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging\njoint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource\nutilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model\nconsistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is\nconducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated\naggregation process.
