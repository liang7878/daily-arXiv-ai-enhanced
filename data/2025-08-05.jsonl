We introduce a novel,\ngame-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the\nMulti-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to\nsystematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM\nagents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs\nto condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,\neffortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium\n(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its\nsequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a\nstreamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining\nstrategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under\nrealistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles\noutperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other\ncooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale\nmodels across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks.

DAR concerns\nthe problem of enabling efficient access to arbitrary rank positions according\nto a ranking function, without enumerating all preceding tuples. To address\nthis need, we formalize the DAR problem and propose a theoretically efficient\nalgorithm based on geometric arrangements, achieving logarithmic query time.\nHowever, this method suffers from exponential space complexity in high\ndimensions. Therefore, we develop a second class of algorithms based on\n$\\varepsilon$-sampling, which consume a linear space. Since exactly locating\nthe tuple at a specific rank is challenging due to its connection to the range\ncounting problem, we introduce a relaxed variant called Conformal Set Ranked\nRetrieval (CSR), which returns a small subset guaranteed to contain the target\ntuple. To solve the CSR problem efficiently, we define an intermediate problem,\nStripe Range Retrieval (SRR), and design a hierarchical sampling data structure\ntailored for narrow-range queries. Our method achieves practical scalability in\nboth data size and dimensionality. We prove near-optimal bounds on the\nefficiency of our algorithms and validate their performance through extensive\nexperiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating scalability to\nmillions of tuples and hundreds of dimensions."}

To address these\nshortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual\nEdge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by\njointly modeling semantic and structural signals.

This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation.

These representations are then fused into a unified\nsystem embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy.

Recent work proposed the use of control theory to\nunderstand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to\nequilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature\nrequest, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of\ncontributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue\nresolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to\nprovide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical\nfoundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this\npaper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by\nexperimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest\nthat (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more\nfeasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)\nimproved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with\nascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves\nthe overall issue and pull request stability index.

Existing\ndebiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this\nattenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the\ndownstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in\ndata-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction\nmethods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that\nsubstantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled\ndata.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level.

For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic\npeeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls\nbelow a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to\ntransform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small\nadditive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph\nsetting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to\ncomposition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this\nproblem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we\ncall the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT\n(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As\nan application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better\nbounds than previous work.\n  We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety\nof problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree\nordering, and vertex coloring.

The\ndataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,\nwas curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of\nnon-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive\nsuite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based\nregressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated.

This has\ndriven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.\nThis paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels\nunder different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for\ntight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),\nwhile disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under\nbalanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.\n  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD\ndisaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of\nTTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation\narchitecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast\nprefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,\nslow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these\ninstances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by\nadjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD\naggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD\ndisaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode\nfor superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency\nshifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs\nto those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.\nThis fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling\nmechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill\nscheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our\nexperiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art\nsystems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs."}

However, improving both personalization and interpretability\nremains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback\nor heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid\nrecommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used\nto enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful\nprofiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These\nenriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie\nbipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering\nmodel. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that\ncombines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust\nnegative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated\nrecommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language\njustifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark\ndatasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines.

Given a\ntesting goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input\ndistribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic\ngrammar.

The topic gained prominence\nin fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -\nreplicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In\nrecent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part\nof this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and\nreliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other\nfields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In\naddition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism\nand computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly\nrecognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about\nhow these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to\nclosing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of\nML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly\nall articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key\ndimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the\ndataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available.

Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms,\nthis paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC)\nmechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional\nalgorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and\nmanage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower\nconsensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification\ncosts. It offers new reference ideas for solving the Internet of\nThings+blockchain+Internet court construction problem."}

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy\npresented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier\nto specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt\nscaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task\ngoals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and\ncode familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt\ninteractions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code\ntraceability, and consistency in generated summaries."}

Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused\nembeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine\nsimilarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of\nmaterial well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the\nPlatonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms\nagent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest\ngains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that\nagent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not\nfully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale\nmultimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite\nimages, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts."}

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation.

However, existing\nbenchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing\nhigh-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk\nof data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation\nframework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code\ngeneration tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates\nperformance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on\nimportance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted\nAutoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks\nto estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,\nwe introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations\nacross the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that\nsupports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,\noffering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination\nassessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points\nacross 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks.

The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals.

This insight leads to a principled\nderivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order\ndenoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise\ndistribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant\nto diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting\nfunction arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the\nexpected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical\ncomparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,\ncan achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter\ngradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training."}

We derive new forward and\nbackward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as\ncustom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training\npipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against\nthose of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that\npredict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical\nresults on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown\nto deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the\nproposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor\nparallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller\nphantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor\nparallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater\nenergy savings."}

In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering.

Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching.

As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

Rather, data is only\nused to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to\napply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous\ndata, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the\ndata density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced\ninterpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is\nraising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our\nproposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world\nEnvironmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and\nequitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of\nAmerica counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring\nequity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,\nwater quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the\nsociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables\nrelated to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe\nnegative impact on communities."}

This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new\nmodeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise\narchitecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages\nKAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven\nbenchmark datasets.

To address these challenges, we proposed a\nmulti-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves\nwith dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with\n43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation\nTheory with 16 relations).

Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated\nand streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with\nguided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS\nframework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the\nuncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data\ncleaning stage."}

This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),\ni.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points\nupon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full\nfine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the\noriginal training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and\nstorage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but\nsome rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain\nset, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this\npaper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet\neffective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU\nemploys gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of\nunlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.\nThis adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while\nmaintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate\nthat IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods."}

For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or\ntrains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent\npresence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable\nconnectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite\nbeams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address\nchallenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can\nanalyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific\nlocations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before\nconnectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of\ncommunication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over\nmultiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model\nachieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of\nmachine learning in predicting signal quality during flight.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown\nsuccess in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially\nobservable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.\nInferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective\napproach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations\nfocus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem\nformulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For\nthe first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement\nexisting Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for\nboth automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that\nsubsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata\nlearning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly\nreductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques\nand identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.\nExperimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of\nmagnitude over SOTA baselines."}

As a result, the\ntrue severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives\nremains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present\nDLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet\nindistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target\npromotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding\nspace, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively\nsynthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade\ndetection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes\nvariability and realism in generated behavioral patterns.

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it\npreserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and\n0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the\nreliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data\npoisoning attacks."}

Using\n145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's\neConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,\nClaude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to\nproduce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question\nschemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic\nautograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3\nachieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\\%), they consistently generate\nexcessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically\nimportant questions under length constraints.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust\nloss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,\nparticularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the\nunderfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$. Essentially, $\\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for\nthe softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the\nloss function. We prove theoretically that $\\epsilon$-softmax can achieve\nnoise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss\nfunction. Recognizing that $\\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly\nreduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one\nsymmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and\neffective learning.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents.

Our experiments demonstrate that this\nactivation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,\nprevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in\npeak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,\non-device deployments.\n  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference\nframework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.\nFlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based\nmethods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly\ninto both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD\navoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the\ntruncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the\nfly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra\nlatency.

This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,\nAutomatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies\nexpert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features\nextracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual\ntask. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for\nthis study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,\nAutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of\n0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is\nviable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is\navailable, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating\nthe model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly\ndelayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate\nthe automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing\nsetups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution\nbetween the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or\nthe task at hand changes rapidly).

We\npresent COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation\nlearning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of\nrelevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.\nCOLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to\nsubsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,\nappearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained\non each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are\nthen used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data\nmore densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general\nand feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by\nany retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest\nbenefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in\nsimulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,\nwhere we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

We propose\nRouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the\ndesign of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific\nexperts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.\nTo capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two\ncomplementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the\nintensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),\ncharacterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each\nexpert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields\nhigh similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.\nMoreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert\nreplacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,\npruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.\nOur work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly\napplicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging."}

However, for modern applications, e.g.,\nthe optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require\nhundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over\na high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs\n$\\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated\ninputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.\nExisting black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''\n(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address\nthis, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)\napproach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\\mathbf{x}^*$\nthat leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently\ninferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can\nselect solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.\nAssuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with\nunknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM\nestimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization\nrate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,\nthus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases.

However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose\nan efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues\nexperience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible\ncompute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay\nrates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a\nmore valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more\ncompute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of\nreplaying old examples."}

In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns.

While\nprior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from\nsignificant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is\ntypically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation\nsparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the\nacceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber\nPruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear\ncomputations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality\nand efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that\nintegrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach\npreserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable\nadvantages in generative tasks.

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to\nautomatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more\nefficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.\nAnother advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without\npost-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and\nreconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different\npruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark\ndatasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)\ndemonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while\nmaintaining high accuracy."}

By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online\nA/B tests and achieved a 1.54\\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).\nIn addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has\nbeen deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,\nserving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application\nscenarios."}
