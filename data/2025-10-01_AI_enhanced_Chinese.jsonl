However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that\nhuman decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is\nframed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges\nthis to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly\nnon-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a\nsignaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the\nclassic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this\nframework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of\npredicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we\nformulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.\nThis model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing\nframing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We\nsubstantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that\nleverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2)\noptimize over language space using a hill-climbing method.

Existing evaluations primarily\nfocus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,\nleaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To\naddress this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end\nautomated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's\nDepth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive\ndimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a\ncomprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge\nacquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and\nrobustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset\ncomprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,\nand 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically\nevaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying\nentropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in\nperformance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.\nFurthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables\nglobal research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison.

In other words, there should be joint\nanalysis of Machine Learning (ML) technique with the possible portfolio\nchoice-objective functions in terms of test period Sharpe Ratio or returns. The\nML method with the best objective function should provide the weight for\nportfolio formation. Empirically we analyze five time periods of interest, that\nare out-sample and show performance of some ML-Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nmethods.

In the process, we also\ntrain an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses\nwhen training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates\nhigh-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,\nwhile also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u86cb\u767d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u86cb\u767d\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u6784\u8c61\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u8fc7\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ece1D SELFIES\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u521b\u65b0\u7684SELFIES\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u86cb\u767d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u5206\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Our result\ncomprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive\nratio of $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen\net al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to\n(Bertram, ESA 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e8f\u5217\u5f97\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u6709\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u8fd1\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u653e\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7403\u653e\u5165\u7bb1\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5728 $O(\\log^2 n)$ \u56e0\u5b50\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u6709\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, FL and SL suffer from key\nlimitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while\nSL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed\nLearning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths\nof FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,\nand security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:\nSharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning\n(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by\ndistributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across\nmultiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized\nserver with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven\nconsensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an\nevaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby\nmitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations\nagainst baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and\nscalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases\nresilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior\nperformance under normal operating conditions.

The working memory of BDH during\ninference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using\nspiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses\nstrengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept\nwhile processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a\ngraph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model\nis biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human\nneurons could use to achieve speech.\n  BDH is designed for interpretability.

First, we sourced experts with top-tier\nexperience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created\nprompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts\ncreated rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models\non APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge.

Recent\nadvances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which\nalleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the\ncollapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current\ndiffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,\nwhich is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference\ndata in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in\ndiscrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based\nrecommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user\npreferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing\ndiffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of\npreference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item\npairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.\nThis formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature\nof recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of\ninjecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the\npreferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --\nthereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference\nreconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by\niteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.\nPreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical\nguarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across\nfive benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and\nempirical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edfPreferGrow\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u79bb\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u504f\u597d\u8870\u51cf\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u504f\u597d\u589e\u957f\u91cd\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u9002\u914d\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPreferGrow\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u8870\u51cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u589e\u957f\u91cd\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "PreferGrow\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PreferGrow\u7406\u8bba\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Recent studies highlight\nthe importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction\nperformance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the\nscene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by\ndevelopers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search\"\nand ``live\" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct\nfunctionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in\nuser engagement across them.

In this work, we propose a novel Dual\nSequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic\ninterests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior\nprediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'\ndynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement\nmodule to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.\nFurther, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to\ncapture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis\nsuggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships\nbetween scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one\npublic benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been\ndeployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\\%\ngrowth in deals, and 0.64\\% rise in GMV.

While graph-based\nANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by\nthe available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory\nusage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still\nsuffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage\nI/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant\nI/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.\n  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN\nintroduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with\nphysical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O\noperations.

The\nmaximin constraint, a common notion of fairness adopted in the FIM problem,\nimposes a direct and intuitive requirement that asks the utility (influenced\nratio within a group) of the worst-off group should be maximized. Although the\nobjective of FIM under maximin constraint is conceptually straightforward, the\ndevelopment of efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees remains\nan open challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the maximin\nobjective does not satisfy submodularity, a key property for designing\napproximate algorithms in traditional influence maximization settings. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing a two-step optimization framework\nconsisting of Inner-group Maximization (IGM) and Across-group Maximization\n(AGM). We first prove that the influence spread within any individual group\nremains submodular, enabling effective optimization within groups. Based on\nthis, IGM applies a greedy approach to pick high-quality seeds for each group.\nIn the second step, AGM coordinates seed selection across groups by introducing\ntwo strategies: Uniform Selection (US) and Greedy Selection (GS). We prove that\nAGM-GS holds a $(1 - 1/e - \\varepsilon)$ approximation to the optimal solution\nwhen groups are completely disconnected, while AGM-US guarantees a roughly\n$\\frac{1}{m}(1 - 1/e - \\varepsilon)$ lower bound regardless of the group\nstructure, with $m$ denoting the number of groups", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b50\u6a21\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7531\u7ec4\u5185\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08IGM\uff09\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08AGM\uff09\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0cIGM\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u5404\u7ec4\u79cd\u5b50\uff0cAGM\u5f15\u5165\u5747\u5300\u9009\u62e9\uff08US\uff09\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\uff08GS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u8c03\u7ec4\u95f4\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u610f\u7ec4\u5185\u5f71\u54cd\u4f20\u64ad\u5177\u6709\u5b50\u6a21\u6027\uff1bAGM - GS\u5728\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u76f8\u8fde\u65f6\u6709(1 - 1/e - \u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7387\uff0cAGM - US\u65e0\u8bba\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u5927\u81f41/m(1 - 1/e - \u03b5)\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u4e24\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and\nencumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on\nvector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact\nsummary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing\nsystematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.\nUsing this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,\npath-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key\naspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent\nto which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the\nreliance of new predictions on earlier computations.

However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by\nstatic and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization\nability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting\n(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary\noptimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation.

Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions.

However, these agents often exhibit\nhallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning\nmechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal\nunderstanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual\nProgramming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly\nintroducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally\nanchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a\npurely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations\nexperienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this\nstudy are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the\nproposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to\na user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the\nframework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors\ncaused by causal confusion in dynamic environments.

We present RANGER, a repository-level code\nretrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent\nworks that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a\ntool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,\ncapturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,\nand augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the\ngap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph\nthrough a dual-stage retrieval pipeline.

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as\nan explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational\napproach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned\ngenerative agents.

Existing failure detection techniques\nstruggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require\na complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge\nstems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve\na sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.\n  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose\nself-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the\nnovel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault\ninjections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To\nidentify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of\nfault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution\ntrace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same\ntest w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which\nare considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.\n  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake\nemploys a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes\nfaults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood\nof uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly\nconnecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,\nCSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the\ncompatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault\npropagations with low overhead.\n  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five\nsystems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCSnake\u6846\u67b6\u66b4\u9732\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u62fc\u63a5\u3001\u6545\u969c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa15\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u66b4\u9732\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u89e6\u53d1\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSnake\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u62fc\u63a5\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6545\u969c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff08FCA\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u94fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "CSnake\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa15\u4e2a\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d5\u4e2a\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c2\u4e2a\u5df2\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSnake\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u3002"}}

Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second\ndescent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the\nso-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied\nextensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in\nsimpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,\nwe revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied\nto a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in\nMycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We\nsystematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity\n(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double\ndescent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across\nthese axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to\nclassical U- or L-shaped patterns.

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents\ndriven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The\nMatrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether\nLLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking\nthe risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,\nensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our\nframework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks\n(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent\nbehaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and\nagents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk\nand capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings.

We implemented the\nTinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.\nExperiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection\nimproves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average\ninference time on the TinyML device.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76TinyML\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684DES - Clustering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0TinyDES - Clustering\u5e93\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u5927\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6c60\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "TinyML\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b0ML\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76DES - Clustering\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7684TinyDES - Clustering\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6c60\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4TinyML\u8bbe\u5907\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "DES - Clustering\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728TinyML\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

While\nthese accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital\nand operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and\ncooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a\ncritical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter\nlifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep\npace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse\nhardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme\nacross three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how\ndesign choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term\nTCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,\nwe use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these\noptimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential\nrequires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle\nmanagement framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all\nthree stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system\naging.

The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

Current systems lack a framework\nthat can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,\nand therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with\nthree contributions.

To address this gap, we propose\nRainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly\nchallenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,\ntemporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation\nwithin the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of\nmeteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six\nessential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations\nglobally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a\ncrucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further\ndesign specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key\nmeteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall\nevents, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major\narchitectures on RainfallBench.

In this work, we introduce\nMAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing\nmultimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for\nalignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete\nmodality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these\napproaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary\nmodality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large\n(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in\narbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-\nand cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic\ntokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal\nsequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting\ncross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality\ncombinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets\nspanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%\nand 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,\nrespectively, under complete observations.

In recent years, various automated\nFault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in\nidentifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges\nwhen applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method\nlevel without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for\nstudents who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While\nsome approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on\npredicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to\nLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,\nexplainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via\nLLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual\ninformation specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying\nfaulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the\nLLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both\nlocalization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we\nintroduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from\nmultiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault\nlocalization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207\nmore faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline.

These models are often trained using flow\nmatching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points\n$(\\mathbf{x}_0,\\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,\non average, with $\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment\nlinking $\\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled\nindependently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching\nbatches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)\nsolver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is\nnot widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that\nOT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,\nwhich only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.\nUnfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring\n$O(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity\nfield, where $\\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be\ntypically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of\nOT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete\nformulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is\nusually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual\npotential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at\ntrain time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner\nproduct search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency\non $n/\\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM.

Choosing the right reasoning\nmodel for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two\nkey levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher\nreasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and\nlatency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model\nconfiguration routing for different queries, and present RADAR\n(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,\nand scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item\nresponse model from model responses with different budgets to different\nqueries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and\nmodel-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to\nmodel-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa.

However, on-call engineers are often\nburdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root\ncauses. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in\npractice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize\ncomplex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot\nintroduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert\ndefinitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and\nrequests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into\na spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring\nexecution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for\ndiagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in\ndiagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.\nEvaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the\nusefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization\naccuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods.

We show that our bias\ncorrection strategy yields $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimators of the ECC across\ndifferent sample splitting strategies and estimator choices. We then derive the\nasymptotic variances of these debiased estimators to illustrate the nuanced\ninterplay between the sample splitting strategy, estimator choice, and tuning\nparameters of the nuisance function estimators for optimally estimating the\nECC. Our analysis reveals that prediction-optimal tuning parameters (i.e.,\nthose that optimally estimate the nuisance functions) may not lead to the\nlowest asymptotic variance of the ECC estimator -- thereby demonstrating the\nneed to be careful in selecting tuning parameters based on the final goal of\ninference.

To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which\ngenerates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce\npatches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in\nthree main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points\nfor vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading\nreproduction and error information while preserving the original issue\nsemantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements\nbased on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent\npipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that\nare both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the\ncorrect patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).\nBased on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional\nassumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,\nhighlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR\nagents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSWExploit\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7fAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edfAPR\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709APR\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u5426\u8bef\u5bfcAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "method": "SWExploit\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u627e\u6ce8\u5165\u70b9\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u9648\u8ff0\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u540e\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe0.91\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e0.20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u6311\u6218\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u5c31\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our\nexperiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling\nproperties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable\nperformance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing\nbelief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,\nshowing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs\nscale up.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their\narms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the\nfirst challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited\nby others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has\nleft, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm\nachieves a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T} + {\\log T}/{\\Delta^2})$,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms.

Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens\nto undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of\nvalue to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns\nthat demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are\nconsistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of\nstrategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the\nrecently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that\nthis problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and\nconstruct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and\nincompetence from sequences of test scores.

For the\nuninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to\nvalidate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program\nequivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8\nincorrect judgments made by the agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-based\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "LLM-based\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u8f85\u52a9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee3\u7406\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc113/20\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7b49\u4ef7\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6355\u63496/8\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms\nconventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and\nDunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches\n(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust).

Based on 54 experiments across\ndiverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,\ndata volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our\nanalysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,\nlarger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models\ntrained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger\nmodels achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In\ndata-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly\neffective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of\noptimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples.

These scaling\nbehaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share\nsimilar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even\nwhile differing in absolute accuracy.

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of\nLLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward\nto supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,\nwhich limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address\nthis by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and\nencouraging grounded problem solving.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding.

Recently, researchers have begun to\nexplore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three\nprimary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code\nsnippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into\ngame engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and\nstate management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated\nUniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not\nonly democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also\nreduces development time by 91.4%.

In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an\nLLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the\nability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different\ncomputational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize\nLLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,\nReplication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).\nUsing a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities\nand computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled\nenvironment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent\ntasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of\noverall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into\nspecific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides\nthe first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM\nself-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,\nto our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future\nmulti-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors\nwithin them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and\nproprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent\nself-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and\nmulti-agent decision-making.

However, a\npersistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across\noperating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work\ninvestigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)\nwithin a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter\nidentification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from\nthe same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related\ntasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise\ncharacteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear\nand cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under\nthree excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to\nreproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms\nwhen excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics.

However, the robustness of TGNNs\nagainst adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit\nthe temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack\nmethods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,\neasily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and\nfail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum\nimpact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box\nattack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose\ncritical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model\nto identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and\ndynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It\nthen employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection\n(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt\nessential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation.

We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in\nframework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than\nbranching at every step.

For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the\nspecific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the\ntense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector\nto recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it\ninto a \"preventative fine-tuning\", forcing the model to learn a more robust\nrefusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack\nsuccess rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and\nminimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and\nutility.

To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves\nto provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a\nwrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the\nsignificant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during\nrescue operations and show their impact on health professionals and patients in\nneed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0cKIRETT\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u6551\u63f4\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u60c5\u51b5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u5bf9\u6551\u63f4\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5371\u53ca\u751f\u547d\u7684\u6551\u63f4\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u8d28\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6551\u63f4\u4eba\u5458\u65f6\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5e76\u4e3a\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7KIRETT\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u60c5\u51b5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u5728\u6551\u63f4\u884c\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

It shows particular\nstrength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating\nits practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually\nlabeled fault data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faT - BiGAN\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u7535\u7f51\u5f39\u6027\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u53ca\u65f6\u4e14\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165T - BiGAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u53cc\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08BiGAN\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6570\u5b9e\u65f6\u6807\u8bb0\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73afPMU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cROC - AUC\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u52300.996\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "T - BiGAN\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7535\u538b\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e7f\u57df\u76d1\u6d4b\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In other words, they can only improve performance on\nproblems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.\nConsequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training,\neven though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.\nThese hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards\nand thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,\nwe propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM\nreasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the\nproblem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the\nmodel generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge\nneeded to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the\nbase policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be\ninjected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and\nregenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint\nboosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals\nfor previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,\navoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves\nconsistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining\ncomplementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper\nlimit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.\nFurthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and\nwhen hints are most useful.

Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture\nto static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby\nsidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally\naligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating\ninterpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI\nalignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of \"thick\ndescription,\" we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect\ndeeper cultural meanings--what we term \"thick outputs\"-grounded firmly in\nuser-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for\nsuccessful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,\nthe capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural\ncontexts implied within prompts.

To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep\nsigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The\nfinal framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed\nmean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder\nfor bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for\nsource, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer\nthat provides calibrated predictive uncertainty.

Please cite the arXiv\n  version until the final version is published", "summary": "Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing\napproaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly\nconform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local\nautonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by\nfeature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering\noutcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with\nsignificant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase\ntransitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules.

While recent advances have focused on\nlarge language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work\nrevisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,\nwhich offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to\nontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE\nmethods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a\nfew models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem\nover merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular\nframework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse\nKGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns\nentities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We\nevaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets\nspanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material\nScience and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u968f\u5206\u914d\u8eab\u4efd\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u5e94\u907f\u514d\u51b3\u7b56\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u77e5\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6545\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c5\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u7ea620000\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u8bcd\u8bed\u8054\u60f3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7API\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u6a21\u578b\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bcd\u8bed\u8054\u60f3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\uff0cAPI\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u968f\u5206\u914d\u8eab\u4efd\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\u6df1\u690d\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u89e3\u51b3\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the\ngeneration-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative\nfunction to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the\nunderstanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal\nGenerative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions\nare often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting\nwith semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We\npropose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that\nexploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,\nour method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the\ntarget query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative\ntheory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while\nconcealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack\nstrategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to\nproduce images for these scenes.

However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information\ndensity over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,\npresenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.\nCurrent TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture\nthis dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as\nfixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their\nability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional\npositional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to\nmodel diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a\ndynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.\nKairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional\nencodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained\non a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus\ncomprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction\nstrategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much\nfewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the\nTime-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods\nacross diverse tasks.

While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives\nor optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We\npropose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned\nsamples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using\nunimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.\nHowever, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident\nmodality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce\nweak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the\nleast confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker\nmodality.

However, there exists\na notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of\nmajority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,\nwe develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust\nradius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted\nmajority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the\ngeneralization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified\nrobust radius.

In this paper, we propose\nContinuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and\ndifferentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or \"N:M\")\nsparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and\nweights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,\nwhile progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.\nSpecifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware\noptimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification\nacross all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the\nmagnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;\n3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to\nenhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns\nacross multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training\nresources.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties.

This\npaper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ\nparameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while\nbalancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected\nfrom a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three\narchitectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and\na hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ\nvariables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the\nbest short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas\nCNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting\nwindows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The\ncomparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data\nresolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions.

However,\ntraditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every\nquery. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy\ninputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety\nmonitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult\nto assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce\nTruncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes\nfor dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be\ntrained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can\nearly-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger\nguardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:\nby evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger\nguardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases\nexit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated\nonly for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs.

In this work, we benchmark generative\nmodels across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of\nstochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between\ncurrent and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity\nof successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that\ncan use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models\nrelying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative\nmodels need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and\nprobabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially\nfulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling.

Instead of directly\nmanipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output\ntoken candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a\nuser-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over\ndifferent parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to\nsteer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's\nefficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show\nthat AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success\nrate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show\nthat guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or\ncontextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in\nboth closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,\nentropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces\ncomputational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.\nOur work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for\nenhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\uff08AGD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53\u51cf\u5c11\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u56e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\uff08AGD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROI\uff09\u5f52\u56e0\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0cROI\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AGD\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u9075\u5faa\u7387\uff0c\u5982Llama 3.1\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece66.0%\u63d0\u5347\u523079.1%\uff1b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "AGD\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using DeepSeek, we\ngenerated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from\nthe CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality\ntraits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was\nmeasured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a\nsingle-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and\nsimulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,\nsystematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in\nextraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and\nconsistently reported lower happiness.

This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal\ntransport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections\nto diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the\nnatural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics\nonly for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this\npaper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\\\"odinger bridges\nwhen one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,\nwith no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the\niterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired\nby recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of\ndiffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy\nIPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports\nbetween multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our\nreinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation\nscheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion\ncoefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to\nthe problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative\nmodels, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental.

Under review", "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their\ninherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to\nautoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise\nsemi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their\nnatural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.\nHowever, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional\nsemi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding\noverhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current\nblock is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where\nlow-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading\nto incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time\noptimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and\nconfidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdaBlock - dLLM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u5b58\u5728\u540e\u671f\u89e3\u7801\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8fc7\u65e9\u89e3\u7801\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e26\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684AdaBlock - dLLM\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAdaBlock - dLLM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6709\u671b\u542f\u53d1dLLM\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This\nlimitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost\nsupermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square\nsummable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the\nincrements of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable\ncondition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we\nfurther provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration\nbounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates.

Given a\nuser-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in\nwhich a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the\nset. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and\nevaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the\nvalue set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended\nevaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,\nsuch as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user\nautonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings.

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we\npropose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level\nExistence Bench (MLE-Bench).

These projected datasets\ncan be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML\nmodel robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their\nbehavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSPATA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30ML\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f1a\u5a01\u80c1\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u62ab\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSystematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u5f71\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9ML\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "SPATA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u6cc4\u9732\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30ML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, malicious actors\nhave started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks\nduring video meetings.

While the actual initial guesses\nare often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density\nmatrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing\nworks mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining\nhigh-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both\nnumerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering\nthe application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose\na method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density\nin a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural\nnetworks.

To\naddress this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,\nhowever, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a\nlearned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality\nhuman annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we\nintroduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables\n\"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for\npaired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched\nprompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original\ncaptions using a large language model.

Few-shot learning\nmethods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled\nexamples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot\nlearning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical\napplications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require\nlearning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously\nknown ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot\nclassification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been\nscarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public\ndatabases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for\nstandard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating\nmulti-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a\nstandard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide\nrange of few-shot multi-label classification tasks.

As\nlarge language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human\ndecision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is\nessential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in\ncontexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently\nambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to\nrecognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter\ndecision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex\nsocial dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over\n13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying\ntheir associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)\nand situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different\nLLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual\ncues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are\npredominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles\nrather than situational information.

Existing methods attempt\nto address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive\nper-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,\na lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.\nOur method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic\ncontent intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is\nclosed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,\ncombining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.\nExperiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a\nfraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,\nparticularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots).

We begin with common failure cases-prompts like \"a cat and a\ndog\" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or\ncolliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the\ndiffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it\nlearned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a\ncorrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint\nprompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.\nThe goal is to steer towards \"pure\" joint modes where all concepts can coexist\nwith balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept\nguidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;\nwe characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our\napproach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements\nstandard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts\nindicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer\ndropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior\ncompositional methods.

The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two\nalgorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired\nmetaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for\noptimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom\ndataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation\ntime, and scalability.

Based on the extended framework and the\nproposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study\nusing a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video\nsummarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the\nmore plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating\nplausible textual explanations for video summarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210LLaVA - OneVision\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u7528SBERT\u548cSimCSE\u521b\u5efa\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b\u7528CA - SUM\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cSumMe\u3001TVSum\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u66f4\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, many KG-RAG systems\ncompose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),\ninflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To\naddress this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation\n(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single\nagent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each\nstep and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and\ngeneration. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL.

To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging\nbenchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in\nreal-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store\nconsumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the\nmost complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.\nThrough a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable\nflexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario\ntasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from\nmultiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and\nspatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous\ninstructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn\nconversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,\nenabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments\nand stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the\nmost advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and\nless than 50% success rate on others.

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no\nreliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or\noutdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor\naccess points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and\nreducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate\nindoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling\nautomatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To\nthis end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for\nI/O classification.

More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations.

By comparing LM\nconvergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a\nfour-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a\nsharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a\nslow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge\nfaster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually\nreconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to\nlearn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token\nfrequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is\nuneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words\nconverge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens\nand content words).

Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free.
