Although we know optimal online\nalgorithms with $\\ell_p$-norm objectives, recent developments for general norms\nand convex objectives that rely on the online primal-dual framework apply only\nto fractional settings due to large integrality gaps.\n  Our work focuses on directly designing integral online algorithms for Set\nCover and Load Balancing with convex objectives, bypassing the\nconvex-relaxation and the primal-dual technique.

Previous works could only handle the offline version of this\nproblem with norm objectives (Deng, Li, and Rabani 2023).\n  3. Our methods easily extend to settings with disjoint-composition of norms.\nThis allows us to recover or improve the norm-composition results of Nagarajan\nand Shen (2020), and Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024), and to extend our\nresults to a large class of norms beyond symmetric.\n  Our approach is to first reduce these problems to online packing problems,\nand then to design good approximation algorithms for the latter.

The reports are known as suspicious\ntransaction or activity reports (we use the former term) and are intended to\nhelp authorities detect and prosecute money laundering. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the relationship between suspicious transaction reports and\nconvictions for money laundering in the European Union. We use publicly\navailable data from Europol, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,\nand the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics. To\nanalyze the data, we employ a log-transformation and fit pooled (i.e., ordinary\nleast squares) and fixed effects regression models. The fixed effects models,\nin particular, allow us to control for unobserved country-specific confounders\n(e.g., different laws regarding when and how reports should be filed). Initial\nresults indicate that the number of suspicious transaction reports and\nconvictions for money laundering in a country follow a sub-linear power law.\nThus, while more reports may lead to more convictions, their marginal effect\ndecreases with their amount. The relationship is robust to control variables\nsuch as the size of shadow economies and police forces. However, when we\ninclude time as a control, the relationship disappears in the fixed effects\nmodels. This suggests that the relationship is spurious rather than causal,\ndriven by cross-country differences and a common time trend. In turn, a country\ncannot, ceteris paribus and with statistical confidence, expect that an\nincrease in suspicious transaction reports will drive an increase in\nconvictions.\n  Our results have important implications for international anti-money\nlaundering efforts and policies.

Here, we take\nan alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in\nparallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for\nparallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence\nas a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a\nparallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to\nparallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nsampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the\nsimulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of\nparallel Newton iterations.

In this study, we propose a\nmulti-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer\nembeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict\nthe drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting\nenvironmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,\nobject mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using\nsimulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift\ncoefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive\nthe net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time\nseries, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and\nobject-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a\nlanguage model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nlong-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift\ntrajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,\n$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different\nobjects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and\ntraditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and\ntemporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal\nmodels perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term\nforecasting in place of single-step prediction.

The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit.

Previous methods suffer from\ntransaction aborts that lead to wasted work and can further burden the system\ndue to their cascading effects. Brook-2PL addresses this limitation by\nstatically analyzing a new graph-based dependency structure called SLW-Graph,\nenabling deadlock-free two-phase locking through predetermined lock\nacquisition. Brook-2PL also reduces contention by enabling early lock release\nusing partial transaction chopping and static transaction analysis.

The objective is to develop a methodology\nto forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected\nvolumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on\ninformation from geological models, fluid properties or details of well\ncompletions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the\nproduction and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit\nthe problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a\npriority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and\nthe periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the\nproduction forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based\non regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our\napplication in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we\nevaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III\ncompositional simulation model.

We further\ndevelop two complementary maintenance strategies for dynamic bipartite graphs\nto support efficient updates to the BD-Index. The space-efficient strategy\nupdates the index in time complexity of $O(p \\cdot |E|^{1.5})$ per edge\ninsertion or deletion, while maintaining a low space cost of $O(|E|)$ (the same\nas the index itself), where $p$ is typically a small constant in real-world\ngraphs. In contrast, the time-efficient strategy significantly reduces the\nupdate time to $O(p \\cdot |E|)$ per edge update by maintaining auxiliary\norientation structures, at the cost of increased memory usage up to $O(p \\cdot\n|E|)$. These two strategies provide flexible trade-offs between maintenance\nefficiency and memory usage, enabling BD-Index to adapt to diverse application\nrequirements.

However, the current methods for\nranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics\nlike user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently\nfind high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an\nautomated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of\nthree main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical\nway to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static\nindicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability\nmetrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,\nscenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific\nevaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.\nExperiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its\nautomated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's\nrho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in\ntravel planning).

However, exact counting\nbecomes impractical due to the massive size of real-world graph streams. To\naddress this, approximate algorithms have been developed, but existing\ndistributed streaming algorithms lack adaptability and struggle with edge\ndeletions. In this article, we propose DTC, a novel family of single-pass\ndistributed streaming algorithms for global and local triangle counting in\nfully dynamic graph streams. Our DTC-AR algorithm accurately estimates triangle\ncounts without prior knowledge of graph size, leveraging multi-machine\nresources. Additionally, we introduce DTC-FD, an algorithm tailored for fully\ndynamic graph streams, incorporating edge insertions and deletions. Using\nRandom Pairing and future edge insertion compensation, DTC-FD achieves unbiased\nand accurate approximations across multiple machines. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements over baselines. DTC-AR achieves up to\n$2029.4\\times$ and $27.1\\times$ more accuracy, while maintaining the best\ntrade-off between accuracy and storage space.

The cross-validation method with ten folds was applied\non the training datasets to assess the effectiveness of the models. To evaluate\nthe accuracy and reliability of the models, the accuracy, neighborhood\naccuracy, and macro averaged f1 score were determined.

Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`,\nfinding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods\nrequire either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of\n`v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both\ncostly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for\nnon-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible.\n  We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single\nrun with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior\nfrom a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing\ncriterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime\ndefinition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit\nvariables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles:\n(1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered\nvariables with recorded memory to analyze definitions.\n  We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing\nbenchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution\nSlicer.

While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining.

Furthermore, in the cases\nthey are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets\nwith other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only\nwith the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and\nis, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the\neffects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public\nand private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is\nknown to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the\nclassifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL\nmethods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both\napproaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the\nnumber of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods\nsubstantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational\nalignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.\nThroughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,\nshowing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard\nmethods achieve in the public setting.

However, current RL systems continue\nto grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:\n(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time\nscaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in\nGPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation\noffer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.\n  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout\nresponses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based\non the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate\nRL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we\npresent HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the\nsimilarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.\nSecond, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier\nscheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout\ndistributions to balance workload among rollout workers.

However, little is known about how open-source projects\nuse and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub\nprojects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:\nWe conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub\nActions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using\nSonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud\nprojects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among\n265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default\nquality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to\npass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate\nprovided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with\ndifferent conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with\nSonarQube Cloud's \"Clean as You Code\" principle and enforce security,\nmaintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or\nmodified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined\nconfigurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to\nmeet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a\nfuture research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software\noutcomes (e.g., improvement of software security).

Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.\nHowever, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,\nnecessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.\nTo fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first\nfully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log\nfile formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its\ncore, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting\nmechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive\nqueries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic\nchunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using\nembedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical\nQ-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual\nevolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation\ndemonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,\nachieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u65e5\u5fd7\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6SchemaCoder\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Residual Question - Tree\uff08Q - Tree\uff09Boosting\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6709\u754c\u5206\u5272\u5206\u533a\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u91c7\u6837\u9009\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u5206\u5c42Q - Tree\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LogHub - 2.0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u534721.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "SchemaCoder\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u65e5\u5fd7\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from\n1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs\nand rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an\nAI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and\nsegmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under\ndermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,\neSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual\ncaptions, and clinical concepts.

Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing\nquality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint\nfollowing (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement\nlearning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward\nstrategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight\nmixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.\nTo address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards\n(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model\nevaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model\nassessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward\nweight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled\ngroups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in\nGRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this\nproposed method.

However, real-world test data often exhibit domain\nshifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we\nfound that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test\nstreams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for\nfiltering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

The framework is built on four core\nprinciples: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,\nself-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent\ntasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:\nAgents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal\nexperiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent\nmemory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting\nrecurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively\nrefined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge\nInternalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into\nimplicit and intuitive capabilities as \"second nature\".\n  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a\nstudent's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal\ndevelopment, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife\nis designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From\nContext to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning.

Both\nacoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable\nthree-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and\nArousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),\nwe construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between\nscripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a\npronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not\nforecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the\nout-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility\npredictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive\ntransitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual\nstability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant\narousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal\napproach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the\ncomplementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e09\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u62d3\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4fa7\u91cd\u7406\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u2018\u98ce\u683c\u2019\u662f\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u54f2\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u8003\u5bdf\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u542b\u4e49\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u9a71\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u805a\u7126\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5143\u7d20\u7b49\u62d3\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard\ndetection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded\nassessment of 240 dialogues.

GaaS employs declarative rules\nand a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and\nseverity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive\ninterventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.\n  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models\n(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial\ndecision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,\nGaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All\nactions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that\nGaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving\nthroughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing\nuntrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.\n  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,\nGaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent\necosystems.

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art.

This setup is well suited for implicit choices users\nmake when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible\ncomparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable\nfeedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be\ndescribed as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after\nconsuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen\nfrom the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison\nitem can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading\nto better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of\nthe temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we\nfirst show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the\nhistory is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show\nthat a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm\nto accumulate a rich history with high probability.

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions.

We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

It has crucial\nbiological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and\nmolecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion\nmodels and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling\nmolecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow\nmatching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and\ninference of structure generation models.

Extensive experiments of four\ndownstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over\nexisting peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight\nstate-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell\nsubtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell\nsubpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods.

In\naddition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two\nsubpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely\ndistinguish the mixed cells.

In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their\ntraditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in\nconjunction with symbolic regression.

However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline.

Through\ntraining on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data\naugmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\\% harmonic\nmean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12\npercentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0\nrequires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on\nCPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the\ncritical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which\ntypically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce\n\\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level\nTTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more\nrobust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,\ncombining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable\npitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite.

SOC\npersonnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live\nsecurity operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the\nLLM into their work.\n  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing\nGPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two\ntopic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model\n(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.\n  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed\nthat SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of\ncomplex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM\nusage.\n  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands\nand similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support\nthis activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by\ndesigning collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.\n  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security\nOperations Centres.

TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to\nextract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future\nrepresentations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based\nsemantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through\ncontext-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using\nInfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic\nrepresentations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by\nmodulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features.

However, when addressing the side effects\nof objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to\neliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.\nThis paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework\nthat systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be\ncategorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency\nand mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the\naforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data\ngeneration. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data\npreparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,\nobjects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an\nvideo inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all\nobject-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for\nreference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to\nexplicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed\nthrough the differential mask between the paired videos.

ModAn-MulSupCon is a\nstrong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas\nSimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faModAn - MulSupCon\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5143\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u9650\u5236\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u591a\u70ed\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7528Jaccard\u52a0\u6743\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5728miniRIN\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ResNet - 18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0cModAn - MulSupCon\u5728MRNet - ACL\u548cThyroid\u4e0aAUC\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728Breast\u4e0a\u6392\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff1b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u51bb\u7ed3\u65f6\uff0cSimCLR/ImageNet\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6a21\u6001/\u89e3\u5256\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0cModAn - MulSupCon\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\uff0cSimCLR/ImageNet\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u51bb\u7ed3\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,\nadaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep\nlearning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,\nadaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent\nbehavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each\ntrained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors.

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aRoofSeg\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u5c4b\u9876\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1EAMM\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c4b\u9876\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u7279\u5f81\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1RoofSeg\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u9762\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u9762\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1EAMM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail\nto meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\nExisting approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and\nstruggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world\nmanufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed\nsupervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we\npropose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model\nbuilt on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel\nsynthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an\nimproved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four\nsupervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging\nall available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for\nperformance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four\nchallenging benchmark datasets.

With its ability to unify diverse supervision\nparadigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet\nrepresents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing\nchallenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial\napplications.
