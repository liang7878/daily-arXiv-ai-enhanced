However, these parts are prone to internal defects and\ngeometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This\npaper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for\nregulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior\nfrom small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic\nprediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done\nby operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal\nmodel that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a\nreduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately\nwith minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on\na complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results\nshowed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric\ninaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode\nvariation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach\ndemonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can\nsignificantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient\nand readily extensible to other materials and machines."}

To this end, we propose a novel\ninterpretable dynamic selection network (IDS-Net) based on feature information\nfusion to achieve accurate few-shot prediction. This transfer learning\nframework primarily consists of two parts. In the first stage, we pre-train on\nthe large dataset, utilizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select the\nsource domain dataset most similar to the target domain data distribution.\nSubsequently, the ReliefF algorithm is utilized for feature selection, reducing\nthe influence of feature redundancy. Then, the Hampel Identifier (HI) is used\nfor training dataset outlier correction. In the IDS-Net model, we first obtain\nthe initial extracted features from a pool of predictive models. Following\nthis, two separate weighting channels are utilized to determine the\ninterpretable weights for each sub-model and the adaptive selection outcomes,\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted feature results from each sub-model\nare multiplied by their corresponding weights and then summed to obtain the\nweighted extracted features. Then, we perform cross-embedding on the additional\nfeatures and fuse them with the extracted weighted features. This fused\ninformation is then passed through the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer to\nobtain predictions.

This improves upon the $(\\frac{1}{2} +\n\\varepsilon_0)$-approximation of Feige and Langberg (2001) for $\\maxcut_k$ (the\nspecial case when $c=1, k_1 = k$), and generalizes the $(0.858 -\n\\varepsilon)$-approximation of Raghavendra and Tan (2012), which only applies\nwhen $\\min\\{k,n-k\\}=\\Omega(n)$ and does not handle multiple constraints.\n  We also establish that, for general values of $c$, it is NP-hard to determine\nwhether a feasible solution exists that cuts all edges. Finally, we present a\n$1/2$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut under an arbitrary matroid\nconstraint."}

This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,\ntheoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We\ndistinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and\nparameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated\nacross a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,\nadaptability, and generalization.

However, they struggle\nwith integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.\n  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,\nwhich involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned\nactions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how\nto integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this\ncould be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine\nthinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three\nauxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery\nUnit.

Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment\nassignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard\nrandomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to\nthis situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To\naddress this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated\npropensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these\nmethods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve\nthis issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet),\nwhich lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the\nbalancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the\naverage treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the\nfeedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the\naverage treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity\nscore framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used\nfor the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the\nproposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation\nsetups and real-world datasets.

DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data.

This setting aligns with the strongly bonded\n(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different\nways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the\nsaturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.\nWithin this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer\nconcentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers\nare in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even\nif not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper\nbounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial\narguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to\nreal-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to\ndecreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new\nframework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when\nconfigurations are distinguished by entropic forces."}

Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has\nbeen of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors\npartitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of\ngraphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the\ncomponents perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of\njust one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take\nexponential time.

Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016).

In one of our training clusters, more\nthan 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training\nstartup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of\nstartup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job\nsize. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level\noptimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)\ncontainer image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model\ncheckpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three\ntechniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and\n(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment\nand evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in\nstartup overhead."}

Given an input grammar, our\ntechnique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers\nto reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in\nspecifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program\nexecutions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we\nsystematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This\nenables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nour approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately\nreproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars."}

However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations.

Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

Our approach\ncompensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and\nhelps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks."}

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this\nranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each\nrelation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply\nacross all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes.

The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog\nsimulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term\npotential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired\nindividuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including\nrobotic guide and alert dogs.\n  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key\nevaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,\nsensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor\ninputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to\ndetermine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex\nenvironments.\n  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three\nalgorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.\nResults show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep\nQ-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and\nmedian steps to goal per episode.\n  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI\nand medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven\nquadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics."}

In this paper, we focus on two\ntypes of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise\nunder the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with\n$p\\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the\nin-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively\nstudied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth\noptimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are\nconducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex\nobjectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that\nthe theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and\nnumber of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the\ncase of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the\nnon-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the\ntheoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to\nthe smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a\nwell-known lower bound for smooth optimization."}

However, the performance of these policies is heavily\ndependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive\ndata collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data\ncollection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging\nexisting or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as\npublic robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human\ndata from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play."}

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink."}

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy.
