This study investigates the PINN loss landscape to identify the failure mechanisms of two primary formulations: the high-order strong formulation and the energy-based formulation. The results demonstrate that the Strong Formulation suffers from landscape ill-conditioning driven by the boundary conditions (BCs), leading to convergence issues in the doubly-clamped case. Conversely, while the energy-based formulation requires only lower-order derivatives, its loss functional can become indefinite, causing optimization difficulties near saddle points. Based on strain field benchmarks against Finite Element Method (FEM), it is found that the strong formulation, combined with a BC handling method and the L-BFGS optimizer, yields the best performance across three classical boundary condition cases. These findings clarify distinct, formulation-dependent failure modes, offering a diagnostic foundation for developing robust physics-based surrogate models for complex beam systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76PINNs\u5728\u53cc\u7aef\u56fa\u5b9a\u6881\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "PINNs\u5728\u53cc\u7aef\u56fa\u5b9a\u6881\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76PINN\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u9636\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u5e94\u53d8\u573a\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u56e0\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u666f\u89c2\u75c5\u6001\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u516c\u5f0f\u635f\u5931\u6cdb\u51fd\u4e0d\u5b9a\uff1b\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cL - BFGS\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6881\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Standard sparse grids offer a powerful solution by mitigating the curse of dimensionality compared to full tensor grids. However, they treat all regions of the domain isotropically, which may not be efficient for functions with localized or anisotropic behavior. This work presents a surrogate-informed framework for constructing sparse grid interpolants, which is guided by an error indicator that serves as a zero-cost estimate for the hierarchical surplus. This indicator is calculated for all candidate points, defined as those in the next-level grid $w+1$ not already present in the base grid $w$. It quantifies the local approximation error by measuring the relative difference between the predictions of two consecutive interpolants of level $w$ and $w-1$. The candidates are then ranked by this metric to select the most impactful points for refinement up to a given budget or following another criterion, as, e.g., a given threshold in the error indicator. The final higher-order model is then constructed using a surrogate-informed approach: the objective function is evaluated only at the selected high-priority points, while for the remaining nodes of the $w+1$ grid, we assign the values predicted by the initial $w$-level surrogate. This strategy significantly reduces the required number of expensive evaluations, yielding a final model that closely approximates the accuracy of a fully-resolved $w+1$ grid at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed surrogate-informed refinement criterion is demonstrated for several analytic function and for a real engineering problem, i.e., the analysis of sensitivity to geometrical parameters of numerically predicted flashback phenomenon in hydrogen-fueled perforated burners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u683c\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u683c\u5904\u7406\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u683c\u63d2\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u76c8\u4f59\u96f6\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u9009\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u70b9\uff0c\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec6\u5316\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In an online fashion, workloads arrive on some of the $n$ processors and are stored in an input buffer. Processors can run and reduce these workloads, but conflicts between pairs of processors restrict simultaneous task execution. Conflicts are represented by a graph, where vertices correspond to processors and edges indicate conflicting pairs. An online algorithm must decide which processors are run at a time; so provide a valid schedule respecting the conflict constraints.\n  The objective is to minimize the maximal workload observed across all processors during the schedule. Unlike the original model, where workloads arrive as discrete blocks at specific time points, the flow model assumes workloads arrive continuously over intervals or not at all. We present tight bounds for all graphs with four vertices (except the path, which has been solved previously) and for the families of general complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs.

However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.\n  We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6Nirvana\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u4e49\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u5b50\u6355\u6349\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNirvana\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u6570\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9LLM\u540e\u7aef\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u63a8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNirvana\u80fd\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1110% - 85%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c76%\u3002", "conclusion": "Nirvana\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

More and more, energy production is becoming decentralized, highly variable and intermittent (solar, wind), while demand is diversifying (electric vehicles). As a result, balancing supply and demand is becoming more complex, making the adjustment of demand an interesting tool. Demand response is a typical leader-follower problem: a consumer (follower) adjusts his energy consumption based on the prices (or any other incentive) set by the supplier (leader). We propose a versatile and modular framework to address any leader-follower problem, focusing on the handling of often overlooked informational issues. First, we introduce a model that defines the rules of the game (W-model): agents are decision-makers, and Nature encapsulates everything beyond their control, such as private knowledge and exogenous factors. Following the so-called Witsenhausen intrinsic model, we present an efficient way to represent - on a product set, equipped with a product $\u03c3$-algebra - the information available to agents when making decisions. Next, we introduce Games in Product Form (W-games) by equipping each player (a group of agents) with preferences (objective function and belief) over different outcomes.

First, current approaches lack a mechanism for automated, data-driven discovery of effective reasoning patterns, relying instead on brittle manual templates or unstable zero-shot prompting. Second, they employ structure-collapsing integration: direct prompting incurs prohibitive online inference costs, while feature extraction collapses reasoning chains into single vectors, discarding stepwise logic. To address these challenges, we propose SCoTER (Structured Chain-of-Thought Transfer for Enhanced Recommendation), a unified framework that treats pattern discovery and structure-aware transfer as a jointly optimized problem. Specifically, SCoTER operationalizes this through two synergistic components: a GVM pipeline for automated pattern discovery and a structure-preserving integration architecture that transfers stepwise logic to efficient models. Formally, we provide information-theoretic justification proving that structure-preserving transfer achieves tighter performance bounds than structure-agnostic alternatives. Empirically, experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 3.75\\%-11.59\\% over a strong TIGER backbone. Moreover, in production deployment on the Tencent Advertising Platform, SCoTER achieved a 2.14\\% lift in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) while eliminating online LLM inference costs.

However, larger brains also carry higher energy demands, imposing additional metabolic burdens. Alongside brain size, brain organization plays a key role in cognitive ability and, with suitable architectures, may help mitigate energy challenges. This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks.

Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOpt4GPTQ\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8evLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOpt4GPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u77e2\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u52a0\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5185\u8054\u6c47\u7f16\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Opt4GPTQ\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534784.42%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e51.35%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u5f02\u6784AI\u52a0\u901f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We focus on two distinct rare-event regimes where standard Monte Carlo methods suffer from significant variance deterioration: the limit as maturity approaches zero and the limit as the strike price tends to infinity. Leveraging the large deviation principle (LDP), we design a state-dependent change of measure derived from the asymptotic behavior of the log-price cumulant generating functions. In the short-maturity regime, we rigorously prove that our proposed IS drift, inspired by the variational characterization of the rate function, achieves logarithmic efficiency (asymptotic optimality) by minimizing the decay rate of the second moment of the estimator. In the deep OTM regime, we introduce a novel slow mean-reversion scaling for the variance process, where the mean-reversion speed scales as the inverse square of the small-noise parameter (defined as the reciprocal of the log-moneyness). We establish that under this specific scaling, the variance process contributes non-trivially to the large deviation rate function, requiring a specialized Riccati analysis to verify optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial variance reduction--characterized by factors exceeding several orders of magnitude--compared to standard estimators in both asymptotic regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Heston\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6b27\u5f0f\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5230\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6076\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u6570\u4ef7\u683c\u7d2f\u79ef\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u5728\u77ed\u5230\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u865a\u503c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6162\u5747\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684Riccati\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6e10\u8fd1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u5b50\u8d85\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5728Heston\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u6b27\u5f0f\u770b\u6da8\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3002"}}

Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection attacks make general-purpose autonomous operation fundamentally unsafe. The paper argues against developing general browsing intelligence in favor of specialized tools with programmatic constraints, where safety boundaries are enforced through code instead of large language model (LLM) reasoning.

Using over a decade of quarterly municipality--industry data (2014Q1--2025Q1), I identify ``first sizable entries'' as large, persistent jumps in establishments, covered employment, and wage bill, and treat these as shocks to local industry presence at the municipio--industry level. Methodologically, I combine staggered-adoption difference-in-differences estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment timing with an imputation-based event-study approach, and I use a doubly robust difference-in-differences framework that explicitly allows for interference through pre-specified exposure mappings on a contiguity graph. The estimates show large and persistent direct gains in covered employment and wage bill in the treated municipality--industry cells over 0--16 quarters. Same-industry neighbors experience sizable short-run gains that reverse over the medium run, while within-municipality cross-industry and neighbor all-industries spillovers are small and imprecisely estimated. Once these spillovers are taken into account and spatially robust inference and sensitivity checks are applied, the net regional 0--16 quarter effect on covered employment is positive but modest in magnitude and estimated with considerable uncertainty. The results imply that first sizable entries generate substantial local gains where they occur, but much smaller and less precisely measured net employment gains for the broader regional economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial spillovers when evaluating place-based policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6ce2\u591a\u9ece\u5404\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e1a\u8fdb\u5165\u5bf9\u5f53\u5730\u548c\u5468\u8fb9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5730\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u51c0\u5c31\u4e1a\u6536\u76ca\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e1a\u8fdb\u5165\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6ce2\u591a\u9ece\u5404\u5f53\u5730\u548c\u5468\u8fb9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u7a33\u5065\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5e02\u653f - \u884c\u4e1a\u5355\u5143\u5c31\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u6709\u957f\u671f\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u540c\u884c\u4e1a\u90bb\u5c45\u77ed\u671f\u6709\u6536\u76ca\u540e\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b\u884c\u4e1a\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u884c\u4e1a\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\uff1b\u533a\u57df\u51c0\u5c31\u4e1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3a\u6b63\u4f46\u5e45\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e1a\u8fdb\u5165\u5f53\u5730\u6536\u76ca\u5927\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u51c0\u5c31\u4e1a\u6536\u76ca\u5c0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u7b56\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a \"vanishing phase gradient\" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%.

To appear", "summary": "Diverse types of edge data, such as 2D geo-locations and 3D point clouds, are collected by sensors like lidar and GPS receivers on edge devices. On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task. Experimental results show that UnIS achieves average speedups of 17.96x in index construction, 1.60x in insertion, 7.15x in kNN search, and 1.09x in radius search compared to the BMKD-tree.

Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles.

This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport.

However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\\% while achieving a 92\\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faZ - Space\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3MCP\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u5339\u914d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u997f\u4e86\u4e48\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7MCP\u670d\u52a1\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8131\u8282\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faZ - Space\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u63a8\u7406\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u997f\u4e86\u4e48\u5e73\u53f0\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e96.26%\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92%\u3002", "conclusion": "Z - Space\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

In 2024, Rx Kids was launched in Flint, Michigan, achieving near 100% aggregate take up and providing every expectant mother with unconditional cash transfers during pregnancy and infancy. Synthetic difference-in-differences was used to compare changes in allegations of maltreatment within the first six months of life in Flint before and after implementation of Rx Kids relative to the corresponding change in control cities without the program. In the three years prior to the implementation of Rx Kids, the proportion of infants with a maltreatment allegation within the first six months of life was 21.7% in Flint and 19.5% among control cities. After implementation of Rx Kids in 2024, the maltreatment allegation rate dropped to 15.5% in Flint, falling below the maltreatment allegation rate of 20.6% among the control cities. Rx Kids was associated with a statistically significant 7.0 percentage-point decrease in the maltreatment allegation rate (p = 0.021), corresponding to a 32% decrease relative to the pre-intervention period. There was a decrease in the rate of neglect-related, non-neglect-related, and substantiated allegations; these were directionally consistent with the primary outcome but not statistically significant. Results were robust to alternative model specifications. The Rx Kids prenatal and infant cash prescription program led to a significant reduction in allegations of maltreatment among infants.

While such approaches are often considered advantageous for enabling data-driven regularization, we show that their performance critically depends on the sharpness of the employed likelihood form. By introducing a sharpness parameter and exploring alternative likelihood formulations proportional to the target objective function, we demonstrate how likelihood curvature governs both in-sample performance and the degree of regularization inferred by the training data.

Under this modeling framework, the regression function is approximated by an ensemble of decision trees, interpreted as weak learners that capture different features of the data. In this work, we propose a generalization of the BART model that has two main features: first, it automatically selects the number of decision trees using the given data; second, the model allows clusters of observations to have different regression functions since each data point can only use a selection of weak learners, instead of all of them. This model generalization is accomplished by including a binary weight matrix in the conditional distribution of the response variable, which activates only a specific subset of decision trees for each observation. Such a matrix is endowed with an Indian Buffet process prior, and sampled within the MCMC sampler, together with the other BART parameters.

This paper considers a generalisation of this problem to \\emph{temporal graphs}, i.e., to graphs whose structure changes according to an ordered sequence of edge sets. In the simultaneous resource updating problem on temporal graphs, the resources which can be accessed will change, however, the necessity of symmetry breaking to avoid conflicts remains.\n  In this paper, we focus on the problem of \\emph{maintaining proper colourings} on temporal graphs in general, with a particular focus on bipartite colourings. Our aim is to minimise the total number of times that the vertices change colour, or, in the form of a decision problem, whether we can maintain a proper colouring by allowing not more colour changes than some given \\emph{budget}. On the negative side, we show that, despite bipartite colouring being easy on static graphs, the problem of maintaining such a colouring on graphs that are bipartite in each snapshot is NP-Hard to even approximate within \\emph{any} constant factor unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails. On the positive side, we provide an exact algorithm for a temporal graph with $n$ vertices, a lifetime $T$ and at most $k$ components in any given snapshot in $O(T \\vert E \\vert 2^{k} + n T 2^{2k})$ time, and an $O\\left(\\sqrt{\\log(nT)}\\right)$-factor approximation algorithm running in $\\tilde{O}((nT)^3)$ time.\n  Our results contribute to the structural complexity of networks that change with time with respect to a fundamental computational problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As data become increasingly recognized as an economic asset, data marketplaces have emerged as a key infrastructure for data-driven innovation. However, unlike mature product or service markets, data-trading environments remain nascent and suffer from pronounced information asymmetry. Buyers cannot verify the content or quality before purchasing data, making trust and quality assurance central challenges. To address these issues, this study develops a multi-agent data-market simulator that models participant behavior and evaluates the institutional mechanisms for trust formation. Focusing on the manufacturing sector, where initiatives such as GAIA-X and Catena-X are advancing, the simulator integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive agent behavior and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate utility functions from empirical behavioral data. Using the simulator, we examine the market-level effects of five representative reputation systems-Time-decay, Bayesian-beta, PageRank, PowerTrust, and PeerTrust-and found that PeerTrust achieved the strongest alignment between data price and quality, while preventing monopolistic dominance. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid reputation mechanism that integrates the strengths of existing systems to achieve improved price-quality consistency and overall market stability.

It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6NNGPT\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdbAutoML\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u6539\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd9\u4e00AI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "NNGPT\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "NN - RAG\u57281289\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b073%\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\uff0c3 - shot\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0cHPO\u5728LEMUR\u4e0aRMSE\u4e3a0.60\u4f18\u4e8eOptuna\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668RMSE\u4e3a0.14\u7b49\uff0c\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u8d855K\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NNGPT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684AutoML\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u793e\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines.

In this model, $d = n^{\u03a9(1)}$ cliques of size approximately $k$ are randomly planted by choosing the vertices to participate in each clique independently with probability $\u03b4$. While there has been extensive work on recovering one, or multiple disjointly planted cliques in random graphs, the natural extension of this question to recovering overlapping cliques has been, surprisingly, largely unexplored. Moreover, because every vertex can be part of polynomially many cliques, this task is significantly harder than in case of disjointly planted cliques (as recently studied by Kothari, Vempala, Wein and Xu [COLT'23]) and manifests in the failure of simple combinatorial and even spectral algorithms.\n  In this work we obtain the first efficient algorithms for recovering the community structure of RIGs both from the perspective of exact and approximate recovery.

While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation.

Our first result is a strong impossibility: For submodular reward functions, no randomized poly-time algorithm can approximate the optimal budget-feasible value within \\textit{any finite factor}, even with demand-oracle access. This result rules out extending known constant-factor guarantees from either (i) unbudgeted settings with combinatorial actions or (ii) budgeted settings with binary actions, to their combination. The hardness is tight: It holds even when all but one agent have binary actions and the remaining agent has just one additional action. On the positive side, we show that gross substitutes rewards (a well-studied strict subclass of submodular functions) admit a deterministic poly-time $O(1)$-approximation, using only value queries. Our results thus draw the first sharp separation between budgeted and unbudgeted settings in combinatorial contracts, and identifies gross substitutes as a tractable frontier for budgeted combinatorial contracts. Finally, we present an FPTAS for additive rewards, demonstrating that arbitrary approximation is tractable under any budget. This constitutes the first FPTAS for the multi-agent combinatorial-actions setting, even in the absence of budget constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8d1f\u3001\u6b63\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u65e0\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u533a\u522b\u53ca\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u6da6\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u884c\u52a8\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8d1f\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5b50\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u968f\u673a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6b63\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u603b\u66ff\u4ee3\u5956\u52b1\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4O(1)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u52a0\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u6709FPTAS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u540c\u4e2d\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u65e0\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u603b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e3a\u9884\u7b97\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u52a0\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u7684FPTAS\u3002"}}

By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model.

Supporting emerging third-party applications calls for a general-purpose, queryable onboard storage system.

This paper presents AVS, an Autonomous Vehicle Storage system that co-designs computation with a hierarchical layout: modality-aware reduction and compression, hot-cold tiering with daily archival, and a lightweight metadata layer for indexing.

We develop a model in which users act as both creators and consumers, differing in their ideological affiliation and propensity to produce toxic content. Affective polarization, i.e., users' aversion to ideologically opposed content, interacts with moderation in unintended ways. We show that even ideologically neutral moderation that targets only toxicity can suppress non-toxic content creation, particularly from ideological minorities. Our analysis reveals a content-level externality: when toxic content is removed, non-toxic posts gain exposure. While creators from the ideological majority group sometimes benefit from this exposure, they do not internalize the negative spillovers, i.e., increased out-group animosity toward minority creators. This can discourage minority creation and polarize the content supply, ultimately leaving minority users in a more ideologically imbalanced environment: a mechanism reminiscent of the \"spiral of silence.\" Thus, our model offers an alternative perspective to a common debate: what appears as bias in moderation needs not reflect bias in rules, but can instead emerge endogenously as self-censorship in equilibrium.

We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe.

Curticapean and Marx (FOCS'14) show that if the graph $H$ has vertex cover number $\u03c4$, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(|H|^{2^{O(\u03c4)}} |G|^{\u03c4+ O(1)})$. This raises the question of whether this upper bound can be improved for input graphs $G$ from a restricted family of graphs. Earlier work by Eppstein~(IPL'94) shows that this is indeed possible, by proving that when $G$ is a $d$-degenerate graph and $H$ is a biclique of arbitrary size, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(d 3^{d/3} |G|)$. We show that if the input is restricted to $d$-degenerate graphs, the upper bound of Curticapean and Marx can be improved for a family of graphs $H$ that includes all bicliques and satisfies a property we call $(c,d)$-locatable. Importantly, our algorithm's running time only has a polynomial dependence on the size of~$H$. A key feature of $(c,d)$-locatable graphs $H$ is that they admit a vertex cover of size at most $cd$. We further characterize $(1,d)$-locatable graphs, for which our algorithms achieve a linear running time dependence on $|G|$, and we establish a lower bound showing that counting graphs which are barely not $(1,d)$-locatable is already $\\#\\text{W}[1]$-hard. We note that the restriction to $d$-degenerate graphs has been a fruitful line of research leading to two very general results (FOCS'21, SODA'25) and this creates the impression that we largely understand the complexity of counting substructures in degenerate graphs. However, all aforementioned results have an exponential dependency on the size of the pattern graph $H$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650d - \u9000\u5316\u56fe\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u6790(c,d) - \u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "Curticapean\u548cMarx\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b50\u56fe\u8ba1\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d7\u9650\u56fe\u65cfG\u8be5\u4e0a\u754c\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9d - \u9000\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6ee1\u8db3(c,d) - \u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u56fe\u65cfH\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Curticapean\u548cMarx\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9|H|\u662f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bf9(1,d) - \u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9|G|\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u5bf9d - \u9000\u5316\u56fe\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u56feH\u5927\u5c0f\u6709\u6307\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While well studied in static settings, this tradeoff becomes significantly more complex when content creators strategically adapt to platform incentives. To analyze how such competition reshapes the tradeoff for maximizing user welfare, we introduce the Content Creator Competition with Bias-Variance Tradeoff framework, a tractable game-theoretic model that captures the platform's decision on regularization strength in user feature estimation. We derive and compare the platform's optimal policy under two key settings: a non-strategic baseline with fixed content and a strategic environment where creators compete in response to the platform's algorithmic design.\n  Our theoretical analysis in a stylized model shows that, compared to the non-strategic environment, content creator competition shifts the platform's optimal policy toward weaker regularization, thereby favoring lower bias in the bias-variance tradeoff. To validate and assess the robustness of these insights beyond the stylized setting, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The empirical results consistently support our theoretical conclusion: in strategic environments, reducing bias leads to higher user welfare.

Existing cross-disciplinary methods rely on overlapping entities between disciplines for knowledge transfer through simple mapping functions, but suffer from two key limitations: (1) overlapping entities are scarce in real-world scenarios, and (2) simple mappings inadequately capture cross-disciplinary knowledge complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mixed of Experts and Adversarial Generative Network-based Cross-disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing Framework. Our approach consists of three key components: First, we pre-train a source discipline model and cluster student knowledge states into K categories. Second, these cluster attributes guide a mixture-of-experts network through a gating mechanism, serving as a cross-domain mapping bridge.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation.

While heterogeneous agent models offer a more realistic alternative to representative agent frameworks, their implementation poses significant computational challenges, particularly in continuous time. The Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, recast as a system of partial differential equations, typically relies on grid-based solvers that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computational cost, and numerical inaccuracies. This paper introduces the ABH-PINN solver, an approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embeds the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations directly into the neural network training objective. By replacing grid-based approximation with mesh-free, differentiable function learning, the ABH-PINN solver benefits from the advantages of PINNs of improved scalability, smoother solutions, and computational efficiency.

Correspondence: Rui.Tong@warwick.ac.uk", "summary": "Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training.

Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed.

We observe that the problem is simplest when $U$ is diagonal, where we see that the `paths' in the graph defined by non-zero elements of $A_l$ and $B_l$ determine the solution. Inspired by this we generalize this to the case when $U$ is block-diagonal to identify a form refered to as the `Solution-form' using `paths' determined by non-zero sub-matrices of $A_l,B_l$ which are non-zero multiples of Unitary. When not in Solution form we find an equivalent problem to solve by diagonalizing a Hermitian or a Normal matrix related to the sub-matrices. The problem is solved in a maximum of $n$ steps.

Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining.

The core contribution is the application of a weighted entropy heuristic, based on the Belis-Guias, u framework, which assigns context-dependent utility values to each of the possible feedback types. A genetic algorithm optimization approach discovers interpretable weight patterns that reflect strategic game dynamics. First, I demonstrate that a single, fixed vector of optimized weights achieves a remarkable 4.3565 average guesses with a maximum of 5. Building upon this, I introduce a stage-weighted heuristic with distinct utility vectors for each turn, achieving 4.3488 average guesses with a maximum of 6, approaching the theoretical optimum of 4.3403 by less than 0.2%. The method retains the computational efficiency of classical one-step-ahead heuristics while significantly improving performance through principled information valuation.

This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models.

In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x. Also, SparOA achieves optimal energy-per-inference, consuming 7\\%-16\\% less energy than the SOTA co-execution baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSparOA CPU - GPU\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "DNN\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparOA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9608\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "SparOA\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f1.22 - 1.31\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u7528CPU\u6700\u591a\u5feb50.7\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u6bd4SOTA\u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e7% - 16%\u3002", "conclusion": "SparOA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002"}}

We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdAgint\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u56fe\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801DAGs\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56e2\u961f\u9ad8\u6548\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\u5c42\u548c\u6df7\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u7684JIT\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684Unix\u98ce\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u7b49\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Agint\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e2\u961f\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u65e0\u7f1d\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4ee5\u56e2\u961f\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding.

This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems.

However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08ST - HCMs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u574d\u7f29\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e38\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u3001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ST - HCMs\u56fe\u5f62\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u574d\u7f29\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9a\u7406\u8868\u660e\u590d\u6742ST - HCMs\u968f\u5b50\u5355\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u6241\u5e73\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ST - HCMs\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ST - HCMs\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Partial-mastery CDMs (PM-CDMs) are an important extension of CDMs. They model individuals' status for each attribute to be continuous for measuring the partial mastery level, which relaxes the restrictive discrete-attribute assumption of classical CDMs. As a result, PM-CDMs often yield better fits for real-world data and refined measurement of the substantive attributes of interest. However, these models inherit some strong parametric assumptions from the traditional CDMs about the item response functions and, thus, still suffer from a significant risk of model misspecification. This paper proposes a generalized additive PM-CDM (GaPM-CDM) that substantially relaxes the parametric assumptions of PM-CDMs. This proposal leverages model parsimony and interpretability by modeling each item response function as a mixture of nonparametric monotone functions of attributes. A method for the estimation of GaPM-CDM is developed, which combines the marginal maximum likelihood estimator with a sieve approximation of the nonparametric functions. The new model is applicable under both confirmatory and exploratory settings, depending on whether prior knowledge is available about the relationship between observed variables and attributes. The proposed method is applied to two measurement problems from educational testing and healthcare research, respectively, and further evaluated and compared with PM-CDMs through extensive simulation studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u52a0\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u638c\u63e1\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08GaPM - CDM\uff09\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u638c\u63e1\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08PM - CDM\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPM - CDM\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDMs\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u9645\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7b5b\u6cd5\u903c\u8fd1\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e0ePM - CDM\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GaPM - CDM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u653e\u677ePM - CDM\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \\emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model.

An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies.

However, traditional collaborative filtering-based sequential recommendation models often lead to suboptimal performance due to the limited information of their collaborative signals. With the rapid development of LLMs, an increasing number of works have incorporated LLMs' world knowledge into sequential recommendation. Although they achieve considerable gains, these approaches typically assume the correctness of LLM-generated results and remain susceptible to noise induced by LLM hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a flexible framework that integrates generation augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval, and holistic attention enhancement which employs multi-level attention to effectively employ LLM's world knowledge even with hallucinations and better capture users' dynamic interests. The retrieved similar users/items serve as auxiliary contextual information for the later holistic attention enhancement module, effectively mitigating the noisy guidance of supervision-based methods.

We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs).

Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies.

However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability.

This model is designed to rectify sample selection biases based on the assumption of bivariate normal error terms. However, real data diverge from this assumption in the presence of heavy tails and/or atypical observations. Recently, this assumption has been relaxed via a more flexible Student's t-distribution, which has appealing statistical properties. This paper introduces a novel Heckman selection model using a bivariate contaminated normal distribution for the error terms. We present an efficient ECM algorithm for parameter estimation with closed-form expressions at the E-step based on truncated multinormal distribution formulas. The identifiability of the proposed model is also discussed, and its properties have been examined. Through simulation studies, we compare our proposed model with the normal and Student's t counterparts and investigate the finite-sample properties and the variation in missing rate.

Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain.

We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $\u0394(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/\u03b4))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering.

This archived version has a full appendix", "summary": "Real-world AI/ML workflows often apply inference computations to feature vectors joined from multiple datasets. To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInferF\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u5b50\u5316ML\u5728\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u5bf9AI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u56e0\u5b50\u5316ML\u5728\u591a\u8def\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u5bf9AI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInferF\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u4e0b\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5230\u8fde\u63a5\u6811\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728Velox\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0InferF\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6700\u9ad811.3\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u5b50\u5316ML\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4f7fAI/ML\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose HKRAG, a new holistic RAG framework designed to explicitly capture and integrate both knowledge types. Our framework features two key components: (1) a Hybrid Masking-based Holistic Retriever that employs explicit masking strategies to separately model salient and fine-print knowledge, ensuring a query-relevant holistic information retrieval; and (2) an Uncertainty-guided Agentic Generator that dynamically assesses the uncertainty of initial answers and actively decides how to integrate the two distinct knowledge streams for optimal response generation.

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfKOM\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\uff08KOA\uff09\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u62a4\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "KOA\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u4f17\u591a\u4eba\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u96be\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfKOM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eKOA\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u60a3\u8005\u60c5\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dKOM\u5728\u6210\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5904\u65b9\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u4e09\u81c2\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aKOM\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u51cf\u5c1138.5%\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KOM\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316KOA\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u62a4\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u6162\u6027\u75c5AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This paper introduces AgoneTest, an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Model-generated (LLM) unit tests in Java. AgoneTest does not aim to propose a novel test generation algorithm; rather, it supports researchers and developers in comparing different LLMs and prompting strategies through a standardized end-to-end evaluation pipeline under realistic conditions. We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment.

Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text.

This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation.

Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable.

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

ADL compilers optimize datapaths and convert software-like control flow constructs into control paths. Such compilers are necessarily complex and often unpredictable: they must bridge the wide semantic gap between high-level semantics and cycle-level schedules, and they typically rely on advanced heuristics to optimize circuits. The resulting performance can be difficult to control, requiring guesswork to find and resolve performance problems in the generated hardware. We conjecture that ADL compilers will never be perfect: some performance unpredictability is endemic to the problem they solve.\n  In lieu of compiler perfection, we argue for compiler understanding tools that give ADL programmers insight into how the compiler's decisions affect performance. We introduce Petal, a cycle-level Petal for the Calyx intermediate language (IL). Petal instruments the Calyx code with probes and then analyzes the trace from a register-transfer-level simulation. It maps the events in the trace back to high-level control constructs in the Calyx code to track the clock cycles when each construct was active. Using case studies, we demonstrate that Petal's cycle-level profiles can identify performance problems in existing accelerator designs.

Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting.

We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification.

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e91\u539f\u751fRDBMS\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5171\u4eab\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edfPolarStore\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u538b\u7f29\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u672c\u589e\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u539f\u751fRDBMS\u867d\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5343\u53f0\u5b58\u50a8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8d85100PB\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd43.55\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u96c6\u7fa4\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "PolarStore\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u538b\u7f29\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared.

Together, they enable continual learning, allowing the system to expand its understanding of the data and improve over time. The proposed model also outperformed existing approaches in open-world learning. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance in continuous learning, achieving a highest average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u5e76\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u963b\u788d\u4fdd\u7559\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u548c\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7c7b\u3001\u5bf9\u65b0\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u76f8\u8fde\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe82.54%\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u738765.87%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals.

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5c11\u8003\u8651NUMA\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fanFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eNUMA\u7684HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "HPC\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u56e0NUMA\u67b6\u6784\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651NUMA\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76NUMA\u5bf9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eNUMA\u7684HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4fNUMA\u8003\u8651\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models.

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements.

However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely.

In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising.

Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training.

Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.\n  We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.\n  We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error.

This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u768415\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u878d\u5165\u5404\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa15\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

On the other hand, methods based on BIC or the Hannan-Quinn (HQ) criteria are shown to require large sample sizes in order to accurately estimate the order for larger-dimensional processes. We propose the mean square information criterion (MIC) based on the observation that the expected squared error loss is flat once the fitted order reaches or exceeds the true order. MIC is shown to consistently estimate the order of the process under relatively mild conditions.

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts.

Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels.

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts.

These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.\n  We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.\n  We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text.

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBeluga\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8ba9GPU\u548cCPU\u8bbf\u95ee\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Beluga - KVCache\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684KVCache\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4RDMA\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u4f7f\u5185\u5b58\u6210GPU\u52a0\u901f\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709RDMA\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u9ad8\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cCXL\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBeluga\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8ba9GPU\u548cCPU\u8bbf\u95ee\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\uff1b\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1aCXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0Beluga - KVCache\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "Beluga - KVCache\u5728vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u4f7fTime - To - First - Token (TTFT)\u964d\u4f4e89.6%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53477.35\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Beluga\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u8ba9GPU\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5411GPU\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u75c7\u72b6\u6982\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u795e\u5065\u5eb7\u969c\u788d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b80\u5316\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5c06DSM - 5\u53d9\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u75c7\u72b6\u6982\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc7\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\uff0cMPCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4fbf\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u5927\u77e9\u9635\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u969c\u788d\u95f4\u7279\u5b9aMPCS\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u75c7\u72b6\u6982\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u662f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u75c7\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation.

While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance.

We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $\u03bb$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(\u03bb;\\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes.

Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding.

Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faParaBlock\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u7387\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u5757\u53c2\u6570\u591a\uff0c\u7ed9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faParaBlock\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eParaBlock\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u7387\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ParaBlock\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance.

We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity.

Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability.

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes.

Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman.

Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ gradient queries per round.

Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5.\n  In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments.

We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora.

In specifying the variational family, mean-field classes are commonly used, which enables efficient algorithms such as coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) but fails to capture parameter dependence and typically underestimates uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a variational bagging approach that integrates a bagging procedure with variational Bayes, resulting in a bagged variational posterior for improved inference. We establish strong theoretical guarantees, including posterior contraction rates for general models and a Bernstein-von Mises (BVM) type theorem that ensures valid uncertainty quantification. Notably, our results show that even when using a mean-field variational family, our approach can recover off-diagonal elements of the limiting covariance structure and provide proper uncertainty quantification. In addition, variational bagging is robust to model misspecification, with covariance structures matching those of the target covariance.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior.

Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics.

We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets.

Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios.

While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6FRAGMENTA\u7528\u4e8e\u836f\u7269\u5148\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5c11\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u4f18\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u534f\u4f5c\u4e14\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u788e\u7247\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u201c\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u52a8\u6001Q\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHuman - Agent\u914d\u7f6e\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4e24\u500d\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u5b50\uff0cAgent - Agent\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfHuman - Human\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4ChatGPT - 4o\u548cDeepSeek - R1\u57282017 - 2021\u5e74\u4e2d\u56fd\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u7167\u8003\u8bd5\u771f\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DeepSeek - R1\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u7167\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9AI\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5b98\u65b9\u8003\u8bd5\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u6750\u6599\u548c\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6536\u96c62306\u9053\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u539f\u4e2d\u6587\u683c\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7528Pearson\u5361\u65b9\u68c0\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7528Fisher\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u9a8c\u6309\u5e74\u4efd\u5206\u6790\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek - R1\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eChatGPT - 4o\uff0890.0% vs. 76.1%\uff0cp < 0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5355\u5143\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9010\u5e74\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u66f4\u4f18\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u5355\u5143\u5e74\u4efd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08p > 0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepSeek - R1\u4e0e\u836f\u5e08\u6267\u7167\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement.

Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance.

Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions.

PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \\emph{Trust Nodes} and \\emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \\emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \\emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios.

However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6LLM - AL\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LLM - AL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "LLM - AL\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8570%\u5230\u8fbe\u6700\u4f73\u5019\u9009\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u8303\u56f4\u66f4\u5e7f\u4e14\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5927\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM - AL\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components.

Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts.

However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select\" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\\% accuracy in the top 1\\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\\% asym), and gets 99.8\\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSG - OIF\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u9006\u66f2\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4f7f\u9759\u6001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SG - OIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u968f\u673aRichardson\u548c\u9884\u6761\u4ef6Neumann\u7ef4\u62a4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u951a\u5b9aIHVPs\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u540e\u7aef\u8c03\u8282\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "SG - OIF\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u5982\u5728CIFAR - 10\u4e0atop 1%\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u738791.1%\uff0cMNIST\u4e0aAUPR\u5206\u657099.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "SG - OIF\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002"}}

The U-Net may have been trained on a different dataset, so its guesses are often imprecise but usually in the correct region. The edges of the resulting foundation model guesses are smoothed to improve alignment with the MRI.

In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u7684VAD/VAU\u57fa\u51c6Pistachio\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\uff0cVAU\u96be\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efaPistachio\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u573a\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660ePistachio\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Pistachio\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u591a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6SATA\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSATA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE)\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT)\u7ba1\u9053\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "SATA\u572818\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SATA\u4e3a\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \\textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains.

Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.\n  Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity.

In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range.

Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.\n  Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity.

In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calder\u00f3n problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE.

In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses. Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684MPNN\u6a21\u578bDDSM\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e15\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570MPNN\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5e94\u529b\u4e3b\u5143\u5316\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8282\u70b9\u6269\u6563\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u5bfc\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DDSM\u5728\u540c\u6784\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u4e0a\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e15\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DDSM\u662f\u89e3\u51b3MPNN\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, it is unclear whether compute scaling will persist at current rates through 2030, raising the question of how possible compute slowdowns might impact AI agent capability forecasts. Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress (which, notably, precludes the possibility of a software-only singularity), and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019--2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth. We provide additional, albeit limited, experimental evidence consistent with this theory.

However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations.

The code is available at https://github.com/HaoranZ99/DGF", "summary": "Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.\n  Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations.

The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity.

SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines. We also evaluate SOMBRL on a dynamic RC car hardware and show SOMBRL outperforms the state-of-the-art, illustrating the benefits of principled exploration for MBRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSOMBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSOMBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5916\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6216\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u3001\u65e0\u9650\u6298\u6263\u548c\u975e\u7247\u6bb5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u52a8\u6001RC\u6c7d\u8f66\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SOMBRL\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks.

In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations.

Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.\n  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.\n  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%).

For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization.

We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $\u03bb$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability.

Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers.

This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $\u0398\\left(1/t\\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound.

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency.

We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SPQR\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u826f\u6027\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u662f\u5426\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e94\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u826f\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SPQR\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b\u7ec6\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u5e38\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SPQR\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "SPQR\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Accepted at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets.

While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search.

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.\n  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier.

While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning.

GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently.

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed.

To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAnon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u5982\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff08IDU\uff09\u3002", "result": "Anon\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6269\u6563\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0cAnon\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations.

Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment.

We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost.

In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMalSynGen\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528cGAN\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5353\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5353\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7528AI\u4f7f\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9003\u907f\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f18\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMalSynGen\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08cGAN\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eMalSynGen\u80fd\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "MalSynGen\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes.

We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality.

Extensive experiments across crystal structure-based benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM improves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, significantly enhancing crystal property prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6PRISM\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6676\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u660e\u786e\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRISM\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6676\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer.

Version identical to the camera-ready paper", "summary": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.\n  We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MPNNs\uff09\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u4e0d\u9650\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8868\u660eTransformer\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "MPNNs\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5176\u5728\u77ed\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u77ed\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u672a\u6db5\u76d6\u77ed\u7a0b\u74f6\u9888\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\uff0cTransformer\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e13\u95e8\u7684MPNNs\uff0cTransformer\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u66f4\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Submitted to PLDI 2026", "summary": "Machine learning (ML) involves private data and proprietary model parameters. MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline.

The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics.

We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt Fencing\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u9632\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ba1\u9053\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u91cf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt Fencing\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u8bbe\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b7e\u540d\u5143\u6570\u636e\u88c5\u9970\u63d0\u793a\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u610f\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u4ee4\u5b8c\u5168\u9632\u6b62\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece86.7%\u964d\u81f30%\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c100\u6837\u672c\u603b\u5f00\u95000.224\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u589e\u91cf\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u539f\u751f\u56f4\u680f\u610f\u8bc6\u4ee5\u8fbe\u6700\u4f73\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.\n  This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30CSI\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u73b0\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eCSI\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u6613\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines.

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.

One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u3001\u585e\u4f69\u8fea\u3001\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec534%\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5feb\u901f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6807\u6ce8\u82f1\u6587\u63a8\u6587\u51c6\u786e\u738766%\uff0c\u585e\u4f69\u8fea\u8bed\u63a8\u658769%\uff0c\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u63a8\u658763%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec534%\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u9700\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2 \\in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5176\u65e0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u8be5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u7ec8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u65e0\u5408\u9002\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6709\u65f6\u6709\u5bb3\uff1b\u53ef\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7eb3\u5165Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions.

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6E2E - GRec\u7edf\u4e00GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faE2E - GRec\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\u3001GFAE\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e24\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aE2E - GRec\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "E2E - GRec\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u81f3\u975e\u51f8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u523b\u753b\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u51f8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51f8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u65e0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u6709\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

Evaluation across 6 production LLMs with 1,198 traces", "summary": "As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing.

We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs.

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features.

Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning.

To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth.

This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness.

We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u51f8\u663eLLMs\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7269\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u752840\u4e2aLLM\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e17\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c12\u573a\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u8d5b\u548c\u7ea640k\u573a\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u591a\u6570LLM\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u51fb\u8d25\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u7684LLM\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u5f3a\u8c03\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios.

We address this limitation by proposing \\textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns.

This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact.

Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content.

Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities.

Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration.

Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed.

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.\n  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\".\n  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs.

While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses.

However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \\pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \\pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \\pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances.

However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration.

However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge.

We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities.

Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection.

Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels.

In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods.

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples.

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8RTL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6R3A\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eRTL\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673aTree - Of - Thoughts\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u6545\u969c\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u3002", "result": "R3A\u80fd\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4fee\u590dRTL\u4fee\u590d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d90.6%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u8986\u76d645%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e73\u5747pass@5\u7387\u8fbe86.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "R3A\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684RTL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u542b\u8d8520K\u6807\u6ce8\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba9250\u540d\u6807\u6ce8\u5458\u6807\u6ce8\u6838\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528Qwen - 2.5VL\u548cGPT - 4o\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u547d\u540d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f00\u59cb\u6216\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u5e27\u4ee5\u53ca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u523b\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6240\u9700\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Due to the scarcity of labeled ground truth in real-world networks, evaluating these algorithms poses significant challenges. To address this, researchers use synthetic network generators that produce networks with ground-truth community labels. RECCS is one such algorithm that takes a network and its clustering as input and generates a synthetic network through a modular pipeline. Each generated ground truth cluster preserves key characteristics of the corresponding input cluster, including connectivity, minimum degree, and degree sequence distribution. The output consists of a synthetically generated network, and disjoint ground truth cluster labels for all nodes. In this paper, we present two enhanced versions: RECCS+ and RECCS++. RECCS+ maintains algorithmic fidelity to the original RECCS while introducing parallelization through an orchestrator that coordinates algorithmic components across multiple processes and employs multithreading. RECCS++ builds upon this foundation with additional algorithmic optimizations to achieve further speedup. Our experimental results demonstrate that RECCS+ and RECCS++ achieve speedups of up to 49x and 139x respectively on our benchmark datasets, with RECCS++'s additional performance gains involving a modest accuracy tradeoff.

In parallel, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are being increasingly used throughout the drug development process, providing scalability and flexibility but also presenting challenges in interpretability and rigor that traditional statistics do not face. This Perspective argues that the future of evidence generation will not depend on RCTs versus RWD, or statistics versus AI/ML, but on their principled integration. To this end, a causal roadmap is needed to clarify inferential goals, make assumptions explicit, and ensure transparency about tradeoffs. We highlight key objectives of integrative evidence synthesis, including transporting RCT results to broader populations, embedding AI-assisted analyses within RCTs, designing hybrid controlled trials, and extending short-term RCTs with long-term RWD.

This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion.

To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates.

The DaVinci Xi system overlays a graphical user interface (UI) that indicates the state of each robotic arm, including the activation of the endoscope arm. Detecting this activation provides valuable metadata such as camera movement information, which can support downstream surgical data science tasks including tool tracking, skill assessment, or camera control automation.\n  Methods: We developed a lightweight pipeline based on a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to automatically identify the position of the camera tile and its activation state within the DaVinci Xi UI. The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.\n  Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.\n  Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications.

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality.

Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.\n  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u6216\u4efb\u610f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u542b307\u6761\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u79c1\u58f0\u660e\u548c14,682\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c61,446\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86%\uff1b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u4e2a\u522b\u7528\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u5b89\u5168\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

(ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability.

As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking.

To address this gap, we introduce Language-Controlled Diverse Style Policies (LCDSP), a novel LC-RL paradigm specifically designed for complex scenarios. LCDSP comprises two key components: a Diverse Style Training (DST) method and a Style Interpreter (SI). The DST method efficiently trains a single policy capable of exhibiting a wide range of diverse behaviors by modulating agent actions through style parameters (SP). The SI is designed to accurately and rapidly translate high-level language instructions into these corresponding SP. Through extensive experiments in a complex 5v5 football environment, we demonstrate that LCDSP effectively comprehends abstract tactical instructions and accurately executes the desired diverse behavioral styles, showcasing its potential for complex, real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0fLCDSP\uff0c\u7ecf\u8db3\u7403\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5982\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LCDSP\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DST\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff08SI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u67425v5\u8db3\u7403\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLCDSP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u62bd\u8c61\u6218\u672f\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u6267\u884c\u6240\u9700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "conclusion": "LCDSP\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy.

We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem.

In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation.

Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data.

However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMBCD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\uff08WA\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMBCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06WA\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u4f7fWA\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u6536\u655b\u8f83\u5feb\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u635f\u5931\u8868\u9762\u504f\u5411\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMBCD\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u65e9\u671f\u5bf9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u548c\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWA\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMBCD\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MBCD\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559WA\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Calder\u00f3n\u53cd\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u53cd\u6f14\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFourier\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Calder\u00f3n\u53cd\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u903c\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53cd\u6f14\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "Fourier\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51fa\u8272\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aEIT\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

Reiss"], "title": "Differentiable Attenuation Filters for Feedback Delay Networks", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce a novel method for designing attenuation filters in digital audio reverberation systems based on Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). Our approach uses Second Order Sections (SOS) of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters arranged as parametric equalizers (PEQ), enabling fine control over frequency-dependent reverberation decay. Unlike traditional graphic equalizer designs, which require numerous filters per delay line, we propose a scalable solution where the number of filters can be adjusted. The frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q) parameters are shared parameters across delay lines and only the gain is adjusted based on delay length.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain.

Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics.

Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods.

Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \\textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210 - \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u800c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5e38\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model.

While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance.

To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efaDataConcept\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53caCABS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e14\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDataConcept\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6CABS\uff0c\u5305\u542bCABS - DM\u548cCABS - FM\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf28\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cCABS\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347CLIP/SigLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CABS\u662f\u4e13\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5f00\u6e90\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}
