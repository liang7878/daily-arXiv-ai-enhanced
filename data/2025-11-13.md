### [1] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语转化为ASP程序解决逻辑谜题，该系统成功创建解决组合逻辑问题的ASP程序，是创建轻量级、可解释系统的重要一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP需要用户学习语法，而越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需与代码交互，因此要将无约束英语转化为ASP程序。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，从简化语言解析AMR图并系统生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建解决组合逻辑问题的完整ASP程序。

Conclusion: 此方法是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言转化系统以解决复杂逻辑问题的重要第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

### [2] [Vector Symbolic Algebras for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08747)
*Isaac Joffe,Chris Eliasmith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于VSAs的神经符号方法的ARC - AGI求解器，初步结果显示在ARC - AGI及其他基准测试中表现良好，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC - AGI对人工智能系统难度大，受人类智能建模方法启发，要提出认知上合理的ARC - AGI求解器。

Method: 使用基于向量符号代数（VSAs）的神经符号方法，将系统1直觉与系统2推理集成，通过以对象为中心的程序合成工作。

Result: 在ARC - AGI - 1 - Train得分10.8%，ARC - AGI - 1 - Eval得分3.0%，Sort - of - ARC得分94.5%，1D - ARC得分83.1%且在1D - ARC上计算成本远低于GPT - 4。

Conclusion: 该方法独特，是首个将VSAs应用于ARC - AGI的，开发出了最具认知合理性的ARC - AGI求解器。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

### [3] [Interpretable by Design: Query-Specific Neural Modules for Explainable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08749)
*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战强化学习单一目标范式，提出QDIN架构处理多种查询，发现推理准确性与控制性能可分离，实验表明查询专用架构表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习专注单一目标的范式，将强化学习系统设计为能回答环境多样查询的推理引擎，解决当前架构无法高效暴露环境信息的问题。

Method: 引入Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN)统一架构，用专门的神经模块优化每种推理模式。

Result: 推理准确性可接近完美（99%可达性IoU），但控制性能仍欠佳（31%回报）；查询专用架构优于统一模型和事后提取方法，且控制性能有竞争力。

Conclusion: 为从一开始就设计为可查询知识库的强化学习系统确立了研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人机协作有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [4] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Neural Value Iteration算法，用神经网络表示POMDP值函数，可解决大规模POMDP问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于α - 向量的POMDP求解器在大规模问题上因计算成本高而难以处理。

Method: 利用POMDP值函数的PWLC特性，用有限集的神经网络表示值函数，结合神经网络泛化能力和经典值迭代框架，提出Neural Value Iteration算法。

Result: 在现有离线求解器难以处理的超大规模POMDP问题中能获得接近最优解。

Conclusion: Neural Value Iteration算法在解决大规模POMDP问题上有效。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

### [5] [UCO: A Multi-Turn Interactive Reinforcement Learning Method for Adaptive Teaching with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08873)
*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型教育应用监督微调方法有局限，强化学习方法也面临挑战，提出UCO方法，实验显示其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在教育场景监督微调方法缺乏动态适应能力，强化学习方法无法判断学生是否真懂及实时感知认知状态。

Method: 提出UCO方法，采用多轮交互式强化学习范式，有进度奖励和支架奖励两个协同奖励函数。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准上与11个基线模型对比，UCO模型优于同等规模模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法能有效解决现有大语言模型在教育场景应用的问题，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

*Weihao Tan,Xiangyang Li,Yunhao Fang,Heyuan Yao,Shi Yan,Hao Luo,Tenglong Ao,Huihui Li,Hongbin Ren,Bairen Yi,Yujia Qin,Bo An,Libin Liu,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍Lumine，首个开发通用智能体的开放方案，能在3D开放世界实时完成复杂任务，有跨游戏泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能在3D开放世界实时完成长时间复杂任务的通用智能体。

Method: 采用类人交互范式，用视觉语言模型端到端统一感知、推理和行动，必要时调用推理。

Result: 在《原神》完成五小时主线剧情，按指令完成多种任务，在《鸣潮》和《崩坏：星穹铁道》无微调完成任务。

Conclusion: Lumine在不同世界和交互动态中有效，向开放环境通用智能体迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

### [7] [The Double Contingency Problem: AI Recursion and the Limits of Interspecies Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08927)
*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有生物声学AI系统虽表现出色，但忽略与其他物种递归交流问题，应从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式的外交相遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指出当前生物声学AI系统忽略与其他物种递归交流过程的问题，探讨AI系统信息处理对其他物种交流结构的影响。

Method: 借鉴哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归和偶然性的研究进行论证。

Result: 发现AI系统信息处理可能掩盖或扭曲其他物种交流结构，存在双重偶然性问题。

Conclusion: 解决此挑战需将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式的外交相遇，并对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法有影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

### [9] [AlphaCast: A Human Wisdom-LLM Intelligence Co-Reasoning Framework for Interactive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08947)
*Xiaohan Zhang,Tian Gao,Mingyue Cheng,Bokai Pan,Ze Guo,Yaguo Liu,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AlphaCast框架，将预测定义为交互式过程，由两阶段组成，实验显示其预测准确性超现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法多为静态一次性映射任务，缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，在复杂环境中实用性受限。

Method: 提出AlphaCast框架，包括自动化预测准备和生成推理与反思优化两阶段。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的大量实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性上始终优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: AlphaCast框架能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/SkyeGT/AlphaCast_Official .

### [10] [Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Assumption-Based Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08982)
*Preesha Gehlot,Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出首个用于ABA近似可信接受的GNN方法，模型表现优于基线，还开发扩展重建算法，为结构化论证可扩展近似推理开辟新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABA在稳定语义下扩展的精确计算对大型框架来说难以处理，需要近似方法。

Method: 通过依赖图表示ABA框架，提出ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，在基准上训练，用贝叶斯搜索优化超参数，开发扩展重建算法。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA实例上节点级F1分数高达0.71，扩展重建算法在小框架上F1超0.85，大框架约0.58。

Conclusion: 为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统部署后会面临多种驾驶危险，需要具备监测危险和自适应响应的弹性能力，当前存在差距。

Method: 提出Argus框架，持续监测轨迹危险，当车辆不安全时通过危险缓解器接管控制，并将其集成到三个端到端自动驾驶系统中。

Result: Argus有效提升了自动驾驶系统的弹性，平均将驾驶分数提高达150.30%，最多可防止64.38%的违规，且额外时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus框架能有效减轻驾驶危险，防止潜在安全违规，提高自动驾驶系统的驾驶性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

*Alvin Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出理解和优化大语言模型推理的框架，用递归细化方法实现搜索，实验表明复杂模型表现更好，递归细化能增强推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大语言模型中提取更强推理能力。

Method: 提出基于逐步、增量和顺序搜索空间遍历的框架，用递归细化方法实现该搜索，设计对比实验，用定量和定性方法评估性能。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试用例中始终优于简单模型，平均得分88.3高于71.7，论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面更优。

Conclusion: 递归细化是通过搜索增强大语言模型推理的可靠架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长程任务上存在错误率高、难以规模化的问题，需要探索解决长程任务的有效方法。

Method: 提出MAKER系统，将任务极端分解为子任务，由专注的微代理处理，通过高效的多智能体投票方案在每一步进行纠错。

Result: MAKER系统成功以零错误解决超百万步的任务，且原则上可进一步扩展。

Conclusion: 大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）可能是高效解决组织和社会层面问题的途径，而非依赖现有大语言模型的持续改进。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

TL;DR: 提出数据高效训练框架OR - R1用于自动优化建模与求解，用少量数据达SOTA性能，降低专业知识和数据门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动优化建模与求解方法泛化能力和数据效率有限，需大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差。

Method: OR - R1先采用监督微调从有限标注数据获取推理模式，再通过测试时组相对策略优化提高能力和一致性，两阶段设计利用少量标注和大量未标注数据学习。

Result: OR - R1用1/10合成数据达67.7%平均求解准确率，超ORLM最多4.2%；仅100合成样本时超ORLM超2.4%；TGRPO使准确率提升3.1% - 6.4%，缩小单次和多次尝试性能差距。

Conclusion: OR - R1为自动运筹学优化问题建模与求解提供了强大、可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，降低了工业运筹学应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原生GUI代理在显式推理中短期记忆弱，历史无关推理影响GUI自动化性能，需改进。

Method: 提出HAR框架，包括构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南和设计混合强化学习奖励函数，开发端到端模型HAR - GUI - 3B。

Result: 模型将推理模式从历史无关变为历史感知，使GUI代理有稳定短期记忆和可靠屏幕细节感知。

Conclusion: 综合评估证明方法有效且有泛化性。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 指出了现有GUI代理存在的问题，为未来改进给出具体方向。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Result: 理论上证明新奖励在方差减少和收敛性上的优势；实验在五个数学基准数据集上实现Qwen2.5 - 7B准确率提升8.1%，响应令牌长度减少19.9%，且对其他LLMs泛化性好。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决LRMs过度思考问题，提高推理效率和准确性，具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床时间序列嵌入策略难以捕捉值依赖的特征交互，需更好方法处理不规则数据。

Method: 提出以MuFuse模块为核心的MedFuse框架，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于现有基线，乘法融合增强表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse是一种可泛化的不规则临床时间序列建模方法。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Result: 在四个真实交通数据集实验中，HyperD达到了最先进的预测精度，在干扰下有更好的鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD是解决交通预测挑战的有效框架，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Method: 提出从“模型训练”到“模型培育”的范式转变，围绕重新设计训练语料库确定了几个关键组件，包括从第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社交互动和构建训练数据顺序。

Result: 预期重新设计训练语料库能使模型从第一个训练令牌起就坚定地遵循价值观，使知识、技能和价值观更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大语言模型能力超越人类的生态系统中，这种范式转变是至关重要的需求。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Result: 在BarrierBench基准测试中，框架生成有效证书的成功率超90%。

Conclusion: 发布BarrierBench和工具链，可作为社区测试平台推进动力系统中基于语言的推理与形式验证的融合。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型相比前代有显著改进，在具有挑战性的基准测试上与规划器的性能差距缩小。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，凸显了表面理解和现实创意领域可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种新的、与模型无关的AI安全方法，可将集合中未知子集模型的安全保证扩展到单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Conclusion: 所提方法解决了合作环境中对抗优化的自毁问题，有效提升性能。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

Motivation: 贪心搜索方法在UHRs面临困难，需比较BrFS和RRWs两种逃离UHRs的方法。

Method: 推导BrFS和RRWs逃离UHRs的预期运行时间，对比标准EHC和EHC - RRW变体，在PDDL规划基准上实验。

Result: EHC - RRW在EHC有效的情况下有强预期运行时间保证。

Conclusion: 通过理论推导和实验，对BrFS和RRWs逃离UHRs的效果有了更清晰认识。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

TL;DR: 研究Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) 在不同系统中的表现，发现其在非线性系统存在局限，提出频谱图损失函数改进，验证FNO成功取决于系统非线性而非维度或复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 广泛测试FNOs在非线性和非平稳系统中的性能，找出其失效机制并改进。

Method: 用多种强迫函数测试FNOs，进行离散化误差分析，与LSTM对比，开发频谱图损失函数。

Result: FNOs在线性系统表现出色，在非线性系统失效，频谱图损失函数可改进性能，IEA 15MW涡轮机模型验证结果。

Conclusion: 系统非线性决定FNO成功，为从业者提供指导，挑战FNO通用性假设。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as promising surrogates for partial differential equation solvers. In this work, we extensively tested FNOs on a variety of systems with non-linear and non-stationary properties, using a wide range of forcing functions to isolate failure mechanisms. FNOs stand out in modeling linear systems, regardless of complexity, while achieving near-perfect energy preservation and accurate spectral representation for linear dynamics. However, they fail on non-linear systems, where the failure manifests as artificial energy dissipation and manipulated frequency content. This limitation persists regardless of training dataset size, and we discuss the root cause through discretization error analysis. Comparison with LSTM as the baseline shows FNOs are superior for both linear and non-linear systems, independent of the training dataset size. We develop a spectrogram-based loss function that combines time-domain Mean Squared Error (MSE) with frequency-domain magnitude and phase errors, addressing the low-frequency bias of FNOs. This frequency-aware training eliminates artificial dissipation in linear systems and enhances the energy ratios of non-linear systems. The IEA 15MW turbine model validates our findings. Despite hundreds of degrees of freedom, FNO predictions remain accurate because the turbine behaves in a predominantly linear regime. Our findings establish that system non-linearity, rather than dimensionality or complexity, determines the success of FNO. These results provide clear guidelines for practitioners and challenge assumptions about FNOs' universality.

Conclusion: 结合算子学习与DPC在PDE约束最优控制的基于模型的自监督学习中有前景。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end learning to control framework for partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach integrates Time-Integrated Deep Operator Networks (TI-DeepONets) as differentiable PDE surrogate models within the Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC)-a self-supervised learning framework for constrained neural control policies. The TI-DeepONet architecture learns temporal derivatives and couples them with numerical integrators, thus preserving the temporal causality of infinite-dimensional PDEs while reducing error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. Within DPC, we leverage automatic differentiation to compute policy gradients by backpropagating the expectations of optimal control loss through the learned TI-DeepONet, enabling efficient offline optimization of neural policies without the need for online optimization or supervisory controllers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method learns feasible parametric policies across diverse PDE systems, including the heat, the nonlinear Burgers', and the reaction-diffusion equations. The learned policies achieve target tracking, constraint satisfaction, and curvature minimization objectives, while generalizing across distributions of initial conditions and problem parameters. These results highlight the promise of combining operator learning with DPC for scalable, model-based self-supervised learning in PDE-constrained optimal control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长时序预测模型受感受野瓶颈限制，主流方法依赖有限回溯窗口，扩展窗口无效且有弊端，影响预测性能。

Method: 提出CometNet框架，包含上下文主题提取模块识别主导主题，以及主题引导预测模块将主题融入预测。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上实验，CometNet显著优于当前SOTA方法，在长预测区间表现更佳。

Conclusion: CometNet能有效解决长时序预测的现有问题，提升长时序预测能力。

Abstract: Long-term Time Series Forecasting is crucial across numerous critical domains, yet its accuracy remains fundamentally constrained by the receptive field bottleneck in existing models. Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.

Conclusion: FlashMap是高性能的针对闪存SSD优化的键值存储。

Abstract: Key-value stores are a fundamental class of NoSQL databases that offer a simple yet powerful model for data storage and retrieval, representing information as pairs of unique keys and associated values. Their minimal structure enables exceptionally fast access times, scalability, and flexibility in storing diverse data types, making them ideal for high-performance applications such as caching, session management, and distributed systems. As modern computing increasingly demands responsiveness and scalability, key-value stores have become a critical component of the data infrastructure in both industry and research contexts. In this work, we present FlashMap, a high-performance key-value store optimized for Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Experiments show that FlashMap achieves outstanding throughput, averaging 19.8 million inserts and 23.8 million random lookups per second with a 100-byte payload, all on a single data center-grade server.

Abstract: As organizations continue to access diverse datasets, the demand for effective data integration has increased. Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data. However, we identified specific failure cases, such as columns that were semantically similar but distinct, which remains a challenge for our method. The study highlights two main insights: (i) contextual embeddings enhance the matching reliability, and (ii) dataset characteristics significantly affect the integration outcomes. These contributions can advance the development of practical data integration systems that can support real-world enterprise applications.

Result: 在分布式场景（数十台机器）实现“最小边割+负载均衡+不可中断查询”。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提高了分布式子图匹配的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Exact subgraph matching on large-scale graphs remains a challenging problem due to high computational complexity and distributed system constraints. Existing GNN-based path embedding (GNN-PE) frameworks achieve efficient exact matching on single machines but lack scalability and optimization for distributed environments. To address this gap, we propose three core innovations to extend GNN-PE to distributed systems: (1) a lightweight dynamic correlation-aware load balancing and hot migration mechanism that fuses multi-dimensional metrics (CPU, communication, memory) and guarantees index consistency; (2) an online incremental learning-based multi-GPU collaborative dynamic caching strategy with heterogeneous GPU adaptation and graph-structure-aware replacement; (3) a query plan ranking method driven by dominance embedding pruning potential (PE-score) that optimizes execution order. Through METIS partitioning, parallel offline preprocessing, and lightweight metadata management, our approach achieves "minimum edge cut + load balancing + non-interruptible queries" in distributed scenarios (tens of machines), significantly improving the efficiency and stability of distributed subgraph matching.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上进行了广泛实验。

Conclusion: CheetahGIS具有良好的可扩展性和高效性，其通用范式能处理多种代表性流式查询。

Abstract: Spatial data analytics systems are widely studied in both the academia and industry. However, existing systems are limited when handling a large number of moving objects and real time spatial queries. In this work, we architect a scalable and efficient system CheetahGIS to process streaming spatial queries over massive moving objects. In particular, CheetahGIS is built upon Apache Flink Stateful Functions (StateFun), an API for building distributed streaming applications with an actor-like model. CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms. We also formulate a generic paradigm for spatial query processing in CheetahGIS, and verify its generality by processing three representative streaming queries (i.e., object query, range count query, and k nearest neighbor query). We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets to evaluate CheetahGIS.

Motivation: 摩尔定律放缓，FPGA等异构计算平台用于加速HPC工作负载受关注，现有OpenMP FPGA工作依赖自定义编译器，本文旨在解决此问题。

Method: 将MLIR OpenMP方言与HLS方言结合，集成到MLIR中，支持任何MLIR兼容前端，利用现有MLIR构建块，通过标准OpenMP指令支持手动优化卸载内核。

Result: 建立了灵活可扩展的基于指令的FPGA加速路径，集成于MLIR生态系统。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了MLIR生态系统的可组合性优势，为基于指令的FPGA加速提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With the slowing of Moore's Law, heterogeneous computing platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have gained increasing interest for accelerating HPC workloads. In this work we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of selective code offloading to FPGAs via the OpenMP target directive within MLIR. Our approach combines the MLIR OpenMP dialect with a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dialect to provide a portable compilation flow targeting FPGAs. Unlike prior OpenMP FPGA efforts that rely on custom compilers, by contrast we integrate with MLIR and so support any MLIR-compatible front end, demonstrated here with Flang. Building upon a range of existing MLIR building blocks significantly reduces the effort required and demonstrates the composability benefits of the MLIR ecosystem. Our approach supports manual optimisation of offloaded kernels through standard OpenMP directives, and this work establishes a flexible and extensible path for directive-based FPGA acceleration integrated within the MLIR ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无锁队列实现因追求无限保护以防止回收风险而变得复杂，在AI时代高并发场景下，保护和协调开销过大。

Method: 提出循环内存保护（CMP）队列，通过有界保护窗口提供实际回收保证，利用线性化和有界回收分析证明严格FIFO和安全性。

Result: 实验表明，CMP在高竞争下比最先进的无锁队列性能高1.72 - 4倍，且可扩展到数百个线程。

Conclusion: 高度并发的队列可以在不削弱队列语义的情况下回归基本的简单性。

Abstract: The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.
  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads. Our work demonstrates that highly concurrent queues can return to their fundamental simplicity without weakening queue semantics.

Motivation: AI和云数据中心功耗大，碳排放问题突出，数据中心灵活性可提升电网可再生能源吸纳，降低碳排放，但解耦成本高，需研究最佳分配和管理方式。

Method: 先定义和计算数据中心负载解耦的电力和能源需求，再评估设计的分配和管理方法。

Result: 优化分配用70%的解耦需求实现超98%的潜在电网碳减排；数据中心与电网合作使电网碳减排提升1.4倍；解耦经济上可行，但不同站点有差异。

Conclusion: 数据中心负载解耦可有效降低碳排放且经济可行，但因站点差异可能需电网干预。

Abstract: The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs' need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.
  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.
  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.

Motivation: 评估虚拟化云基础设施中HPC风格CPU性能和成本，为实例类型选择提供参考。

Method: 使用SPEC ACCEL套件中OpenMP工作负载子集，对AWS、Azure、GCP和OCI四大云提供商，在Intel、AMD和ARM通用实例类型下，按按需和一年折扣定价进行比较。

Result: AWS运行时间最短但收费高；OCI最经济但运行慢；Azure性能和成本居中；GCP表现不一；AWS的ARM实例运行时间可超Intel和AMD实例达49%。

Conclusion: 实例和提供商选择会使运行时间和价格有显著差异，工作负载优先级应指导实例类型决策。

Abstract: This paper evaluates HPC-style CPU performance and cost in virtualized cloud infrastructures using a subset of OpenMP workloads in the SPEC ACCEL suite. Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.

Conclusion: 该框架有望弥合研究原型与企业级部署的差距，实现科学领域可扩展、可靠且保护隐私的人工智能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.

Motivation: 多租户GPU集群资源利用率低，MIG虽有硬件隔离优势，但存在硬件刚性和传统一对一分配模式导致的碎片化和利用率低问题。

Method: 提出仅用软件实现的Flex - MIG框架，用一对多分配模式替代一对一模式，在不修改硬件的情况下实现跨MIG实例的主机共享内存集合通信。

Result: 消除了需要排空的重新配置，减少了碎片化，在不同工作负载下使完成时间最多缩短17%。

Conclusion: 将MIG的操作模型重新设计为软件协调层，可大幅提高集群效率。

Abstract: GPU clusters in multi-tenant settings often suffer from underutilization, making GPU-sharing technologies essential for efficient resource use. Among them, NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) has gained traction for providing hardware-level isolation that enables concurrent workloads without interference. However, MIG's hardware rigidity and the conventional one-to-one allocation model jointly lead to severe fragmentation and cluster-wide underutilization. We present Flex-MIG, a software-only framework that replaces one-to-one with a one-to-many allocation model and enables host-shared-memory collectives across MIG instances without hardware modification. Flex-MIG eliminates drain-required reconfiguration, reduces fragmentation, and improves makespan by up to 17% across diverse traces, showing that rethinking MIG's operational model as a software-coordinated layer substantially improves cluster efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文重新思考用户空间任务同步，提出CES调度方法，可应用于多种语言和库，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户空间同步原语从内核级调度角度处理同步，在应用关键路径引入不必要延迟，限制吞吐量。

Method: 开发了Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES) 调度方法，确保竞争的临界区在同一执行线程，并行工作均匀分布在其余线程。

Result: 该方法可应用于许多现有语言和库，应用基准测试性能提升3倍，微基准测试性能提升8倍。

Conclusion: 提出的CES调度方法能有效提升用户空间任务同步性能。

Abstract: Coroutines are experiencing a renaissance as many modern programming languages support the use of cooperative multitasking for highly parallel or asynchronous applications. One of the greatest advantages of this is that concurrency and synchronization is manged entirely in the userspace, omitting heavy-weight system calls. However, we find that state-of-the-art userspace synchronization primitives approach synchronization in the userspace from the perspective of kernel-level scheduling. This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.). We develop Combine-and-Exchange Scheduling (CES), a novel scheduling approach that ensures contended critical sections stay on the same thread of execution while parallelizable work is evenly spread across the remaining threads. We show that our approach can be applied to many existing languages and libraries, resulting in 3-fold performance improvements in application benchmarks as well as 8-fold performance improvements in microbenchmarks.

*Lukas Gianinazzi,Tal Ben-Nun,Torsten Hoefler*

TL;DR: 提出编程语言SPADA，为空间数据流架构编程提供精确控制与抽象，减少代码量并实现良好扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FPGA和CGRA编程模型忽视空间数据流架构独特能力，该架构编程有挑战，需新编程方案。

Method: 提出SPADA语言，引入严格数据流语义框架，设计实现针对Cerebras CSL的多级降低编译器。

Result: SPADA能让开发者用比CSL少6 - 8倍代码表达复杂并行模式，实现近理想弱扩展。

Conclusion: SPADA统一了空间数据流架构编程，推动了此类高性能计算平台的理论基础和实用性发展。

Abstract: Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.
  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.
  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.

Result: 模型检查器PAT自动证明了通用TDM通信算法的正确性。

Conclusion: 可以使用CSP过程代数对Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms框架中的通用TDM通信算法进行有效形式化验证。

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple FL framework targeting edge systems, which provides the three generic algorithms: the centralized federated learning, the decentralized federated learning, and the universal TDM communication in the current time slot. The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模增大，分布式推理重要性提升，需高效的多节点模型并行策略。

Method: 对多个推理引擎进行实验，分析不同模型并行方案的强扩展性，开发基于递归加倍和NVSHMEM的分层全规约算法NVRAR。

Result: NVRAR在特定消息大小下比NCCL延迟低1.9 - 3.6倍，集成到YALIS后，在多节点解码密集型工作负载中使Llama 3.1 405B模型端到端批处理延迟降低1.72倍。

Conclusion: NVRAR能有效提升大语言模型多节点分布式推理性能，降低延迟。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

Motivation: 以往LCBS解决方案空间复杂度高，为解决该问题并使精确计算适用于更多输入。

Method: 采用改进的滚动行实现降低空间，将LCBS转化为稀疏DAG中的最长路径问题求解。

Result: 实现θ(nm)时间和θ(min(n, m))额外内存的计算，在M << n m时时间复杂度优于二次基线。

Conclusion: 新结果使之前难以处理的输入可进行精确LCBS计算，并展现新的细粒度复杂度格局。

Abstract: The longest common bitonic subsequence (LCBS) of two sequences A and B is the longest subsequence that increases to a single peak and then decreases while appearing, in order, in both inputs. Although LCBS naturally models rise-fall patterns in bioinformatics, finance, and signal analysis, the only previously documented solution was a quadratic dynamic program that needs θ(nm) time and space. We show that this space barrier is not inherent: a refined rolling-row implementation evaluates the same recurrence in θ(nm) time with only θ(min(n, m)) additional memory. By isolating the M symbol matches and their C bitonic-compatible pairs, we cast LCBS as a longest-path problem in a sparse DAG and solve it in O((n + m) log n + M log M) time and O(M) space, which is asymptotically faster than the quadratic baseline whenever M << n m. These results make exact LCBS computation practical for inputs that were previously out of reach and expose a new fine-grained complexity landscape that invites further exploration.

Conclusion: 研究结果在固定到达数和泊松过程到达两种情况下均成立，且泊松和固定到达数设定间的约简有更广泛意义。

Abstract: Many online problems are studied in stochastic settings for which inputs are samples from a known distribution, given in advance, or from an unknown distribution. Such distributions model both beyond-worst-case inputs and, when given, partial foreknowledge for the online algorithm. But how robust can such algorithms be to misspecification of the given distribution? When is this detectable, and when does it matter? When can algorithms give good competitive ratios both when the input distribution is as specified, and when it is not?
  We consider these questions in the setting of optimal stopping, where the cases of known and unknown distributions correspond to the well-known prophet inequality and to the secretary problem, respectively. Here we ask: Can a stopping rule be competitive for the i.i.d. prophet inequality problem and the secretary problem at the same time? We constrain the Pareto frontier of simultaneous approximation ratios $(α, β)$ that a stopping rule can attain.
  We introduce a family of algorithms that give nontrivial joint guarantees and are optimal for the extremal i.i.d. prophet and secretary problems. We also prove impossibilities, identifying $(α, β)$ unattainable by any adaptive stopping rule. Our results hold for both $n$ fixed arrivals and for arrivals from a Poisson process with rate $n$. We work primarily in the Poisson setting, and provide reductions between the Poisson and $n$-arrival settings that may be of broader interest.

Conclusion: 通过逻辑形式化和模型检查程序，可对扩散拍卖进行形式验证和战略推理。

Abstract: In diffusion auctions, sellers can leverage an underlying social network to broaden participation, thereby increasing their potential revenue. Specifically, sellers can incentivise participants in their auction to diffuse information about the auction through the network. While numerous variants of such auctions have been recently studied in the literature, the formal verification and strategic reasoning perspectives have not been investigated yet.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce a logical formalism that captures the dynamics of diffusion and its strategic dimension. Second, for such a logic, we provide model-checking procedures that allow one to verify properties as the Nash equilibrium, and that pave the way towards checking the existence of sellers' strategies. Third, we establish computational complexity results for the presented algorithms.

Conclusion: 提出的Δ-后悔瓦尔拉斯均衡概念及相关理论可用于解决组合多物品市场的均衡计算问题，利用已有近似算法可计算低后悔均衡。

Abstract: We consider combinatorial multi-item markets and propose the notion of a $Δ$-regret Walras equilibrium, which is an allocation of items to players and a set of item prices that achieve the following goals: prices clear the market, the allocation is capacity-feasible, and the players' strategies lead to a total regret of $Δ$. The regret is defined as the sum of individual player regrets measured by the utility gap with respect to the optimal item bundle given the prices. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $Δ$-regret equilibria, where we establish a connection to the duality gap and the integrality gap of the social welfare problem. For the special case of monotone valuations, the derived necessary and sufficient optimality conditions coincide and lead to a complete characterization of achievable $Δ$-regret equilibria. For general valuations, we establish an interesting connection to the area of sensitivity theory in linear optimization. We show that the sensitivity gap of the optimal-value function of two (configuration) linear programs with changed right-hand side can be used to establish a bound on the achievable regret. Finally, we use these general structural results to translate known approximation algorithms for the social welfare optimization problem into algorithms computing low-regret Walras equilibria. We also demonstrate how to derive strong lower bounds based on integrality and duality gaps but also based on NP-complexity theory.

Method: 将服务市场建模为Stackelberg博弈，结合客观因素和主观用户偏好，采用深度聚合网络学习供应商抽象，提供定价决策解释。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，PriLLM达到最优利润的95%以上，仅需最优解计算时间的不到5%。

Conclusion: PriLLM是一种实用且可扩展的实时动态定价解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established LLM routing as a standard service delivery mechanism, where users select models based on cost, Quality of Service (QoS), among other things. However, optimal pricing in LLM routing platforms requires precise modeling for dynamic service markets, and solving this problem in real time at scale is computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose \PriLLM, a novel practical and scalable solution for real-time dynamic pricing in competitive LLM routing. \PriLLM models the service market as a Stackelberg game, where providers set prices and users select services based on multiple criteria. To capture real-world market dynamics, we incorporate both objective factors (\eg~cost, QoS) and subjective user preferences into the model. For scalability, we employ a deep aggregation network to learn provider abstraction that preserve user-side equilibrium behavior across pricing strategies. Moreover, \PriLLM offers interpretability by explaining its pricing decisions. Empirical evaluation on real-world data shows that \PriLLM achieves over 95\% of the optimal profit while only requiring less than 5\% of the optimal solution's computation time.

Conclusion: 所提框架能引导系统达到理想结果，在经典非合作博弈中有应用潜力。

Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.

Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical research on proportionality in approval-based multiwinner voting, its impact on which committees and candidates can be selected in practice remains poorly understood. We address this gap by (i) analyzing the computational complexity of several natural problems related to the behavior of proportionality axioms, and (ii) conducting an extensive experimental study on both real-world and synthetic elections. Our findings reveal substantial variation in the restrictiveness of proportionality across instances, including previously unobserved high levels of restrictiveness in some real-world cases. We also introduce and evaluate new measures for quantifying a candidate's importance for achieving proportional outcomes, which differ clearly from assessing candidate strength by approval score.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验，GIRAM始终优于现有方法，且在更新时间和内存消耗上保持高效。

Conclusion: GIRAM能有效解决持续下一个POI推荐问题，在性能和效率上表现良好。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.

Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR community. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simulation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query predictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.

Abstract: This paper addresses the guessing game in building production RAG. Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations. Together, these components provide practitioner Pareto guidance and auditable guardrails to support reproducible, budget/SLA-aware decisions.

Evaluated on the CPSC 2018 dataset, the model addresses class imbalance using a class-weighted loss and demonstrates superior accuracy and F1- scores over baseline models. With only 0.945 million parameters, our model is well-suited for real-time deployment in wearable health monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CGAR训练方法，在数独任务上提升递归推理模型训练效率，减少计算成本，且推理效率也更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型训练计算成本高，限制其广泛应用和研究。

Method: 提出CGAR训练方法，包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件。

Result: 在Sudoku - Extreme上实现1.71倍训练加速，成本降低42%，准确率仅下降0.63%；单独渐进深度课程可实现2.26倍加速，准确率85.47%；模型推理效率高，停止准确率100%，推理步骤减少11%。

Conclusion: 基于架构深度的课程学习能在普通硬件上高效训练递归推理模型。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态、几何定义的基函数，如RWG基，需要新的可学习基表示进行电磁建模。

Method: 提出物理信息的Kolmogorov - Arnold网络PhyKAN，将局部KAN分支与嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支结合。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差和准确的无监督雷达截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN为经典求解器和现代神经网络模型在电磁建模中搭建了可解释、符合物理规律的桥梁。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PBT变体中，超参数更新间隔步数这一元超参数缺乏有效设置方法。

Method: 通过重启以任务无关方式复用权重信息，利用时变贝叶斯优化重新初始化超参数。

Result: 在8个图像分类和强化学习任务上，平均表现匹配或优于5个先前PBT变体及其他HPO算法。

Conclusion: IPBT算法无需增加预算或更改超参数，表现良好，代码开源。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

*Philipp Anthes,Dominik Sobania,Franz Rothlauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Transformer语义遗传编程（TSGP），在24个数据集上表现优于多种方法，目标语义距离可平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义遗传编程方法依赖固定句法转换，需学习多样结构变化以生成语义相似解。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，生成与给定父代语义相似的子代程序。

Result: 在24个数据集上显著优于标准GP等方法，平均排名1.58，生成的解更紧凑，目标语义距离能控制语义空间步长。

Conclusion: TSGP有效，目标语义距离可作为平衡探索与利用的机制。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性问题。

Method: 提出PEGNet，通过嵌入PDE动态到消息函数、采用分层架构和物理正则化。

Result: 在呼吸气流和药物输送等基准测试中，PEGNet在长期预测准确性和物理一致性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PEGNet能有效解决PDE模拟问题，实现更稳定和物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统实际应用中需兼顾准确性、公平性、隐私保护和责任性，但三者难以同时实现，故需新方法。

Method: 构建隐私 - 公平边界，允许利益相关者交互式输入，嵌入差分隐私审计循环。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FAIRPLAI能保持强隐私保护，减少公平性差异。

Conclusion: FAIRPLAI将人类判断嵌入关键环节，为构建有效、负责、可信的机器学习系统提供途径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的AI代理行为研究结果稳健性存疑，很多研究忽视系统提示的作用及提示变化对结果的影响，而研究LLM复杂行为需稳健基线。

Method: 提出LLM - ABS框架，探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响，利用中性提示变体获取更可靠的代理偏好见解，分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征。

Result: 代理常表现出对公平的强烈偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响，模型表达响应方式不同。

Conclusion: 虽提示敏感性仍是挑战，但提出的框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies. Our code artifacts are available at https://github.com/andreaseinwiller/LLM-ABS.

Result: 生成数据驱动的eMFDs，深入理解其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的位置依赖性。

Conclusion: 有助于交通部门衡量碳排放，优化特定位置的交通管理和规划决策以减少网络排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合二阶优化的联邦学习方法在异构数据下本地预条件器漂移，影响参数训练收敛。

Method: 将理想二阶更新分解为服务器上的参数混合和客户端的本地参数更新，在服务器上引入本地参数的预条件混合。

Result: 理论分析表明在单本地更新场景下强凸目标有超线性收敛率，实验显示FedPM测试准确率比传统简单混合方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: FedPM能有效减轻本地预条件器漂移，充分发挥二阶优化潜力。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Conclusion: DP - PMLF方法能有效同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，提升隐私 - 效用权衡。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: CSTs结合了PCA和VNNs的优点，在低数据设置下有良好表现，无需训练。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: EEG-X是一个有效的设备无关且抗噪声的EEG表征学习基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Conclusion: 用临床有意义特征增强学习表征可提升性能和可解释性，为上下文感知的睡眠分期系统提供实用可扩展路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver模型能有效解决交通网络时空预测问题，在性能和训练效率上表现良好。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的离线强化学习方法对低质量数据集中冗余动作进行无差别正则化，导致过度保守和扩散建模表达性与效率失衡。

Method: 提出DIVO方法，引入二元加权机制引导扩散模型训练，在策略改进时动态过滤高回报潜力动作。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，DIVO平均回报显著提升，在AntMaze领域优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIVO方法实现了离线强化学习中保守性和探索性的关键平衡，性能优越。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Result: 在CIFAR - 10、GTSRB和TinyImageNet上的实验显示，该方法在不同攻击类型、数据集和架构下均能以高干净准确率实现卓越的后门抑制。

Conclusion: 所提方法优于现有防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Method: 将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数，用归一化流估计CVAEs中潜在空间给定标签的条件分布。

Result: 相比现有方法，FID降低5%，对数似然增加7.7%。

Conclusion: 使用特定方法改进的CVAE在图像生成上比现有方法效果更好。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，相比基线，Bayesian - MoE改善了预期校准误差（ECE）和负对数似然（NLL）。

Conclusion: Bayesian - MoE对可靠的下游决策有效。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR)解决现有Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE)模型问题，在多任务上表现更好。


<details>

Motivation: 现有SMoE模型依赖辅助损失和额外可训练参数导致目标不一致和模型复杂，基于Sinkhorn的方法训练开销大。

Method: 将token到专家的分配表述为最优传输问题，引入基于最优传输的路由，提出SSR机制替代辅助损失。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR训练更快、准确率更高、对输入损坏更鲁棒。

Conclusion: SSR能有效促进平衡的token分配，同时保留专家选择的灵活性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: FedSDWC方法有效提升了联邦学习的泛化能力和检测OOD数据的能力。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI.

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多个文本编码器上的实验表明，GeoGNN能大幅缓解语义漂移，持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 流形感知聚合在文本属性图学习中很重要。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Result: 通过大量实验表明该方法实现了更优的分类性能，且对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HCL在实际弱监督场景中是有效的。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLHF/DPO流程的基本漏洞，提供评估其抗低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: TERLA具有泛化性，单个代理可多次部署防御不同拓扑和规模网络，提升防御性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 这是全潜在空间代理间通信的可行性研究，结果显示其潜力，为未来研究提供见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

Result: 在九个涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类方面始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并能选择与有意义模式一致的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS是一种有效的无监督特征选择方法，可在不依赖固定先验组或标签监督的情况下发现潜在特征组并选择最具信息性的组。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: 为构建紧凑记忆开辟新方向，对未来持续深度学习有用。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

Conclusion: DFDT能有效解决跨域策略适应中轨迹片段拼接性差的问题，提升决策转换器策略的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

Conclusion: FSampler能有效加速扩散采样，且不改变采样器公式。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Motivation: 传统分支定界（B&B）求解混合整数线性规划（MILP）问题时，静态手工启发式变量选择策略效率有限，需探索新策略。

Result: 计算实验表明，MBRL分支智能体在四个标准MILP基准上优于先前的最先进强化学习方法。

Conclusion: PlanB&B方法能有效提升MILP问题的求解效率。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布式GNN训练框架能有效解决组合优化问题，具有良好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Conclusion: 为预测编码何时及为何诱导结构化表征提供了原则性理解，弥合了实证观察和理论基础间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: DFA能有效同时降低联邦学习模型的效用和公平性，GuardFed可有效防御此类攻击，实现模型准确性和公平性的保护。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Conclusion: RENTT算法在解决神经网络可解释性问题上具有优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Conclusion: TCNN具有更出色的泛化和鲁棒性，激活操作、并行架构和信息融合层有优势。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Motivation: 大语言模型扩展范式有巨大内存开销，现有研究主要解决参数和优化器状态内存减少问题，激活内存尤其是前馈网络（FFNs）的激活内存成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 对大语言模型进行详细内存分析，确定FFN激活是激活内存开销的主要来源，引入MoC架构，通过SwiGLU的原生门控机制为每个token选择Top - K最相关通道，部分加载权重到GPU SRAM。

Result: MoC在预训练时大幅减少激活内存，通过减少内存访问提高推理效率。

Conclusion: MoC能显著节省内存和提高吞吐量，同时保持有竞争力的模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Result: 证明在MAI准则下，QWI几乎肯定收敛到最优Q函数和Whittle指标，在推荐系统中QWI能适应潜在状态变化并收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型和QWI方法能有效处理非平稳环境下的决策问题，理论和实验结果相符。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: DFAX是一种更优的特征归因方法，能更好地满足复杂黑盒AI模型决策解释需求。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: WOODELF能实现快速计算且可无缝集成到现有框架，支持SHAP及其他博弈论值的大规模计算。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Conclusion: 为新颖、经济且对患者友好的PET几何设计在临床应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Result: 通过大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性。

Conclusion: CREAT能平衡对抗效果和隐蔽性，以最小的可检测性实现目标污染。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Conclusion: AGT为分析通过一阶优化方法训练的模型行为提供了正式方法。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，CallosumNet与黄金模型相比相对MAE损失仅1%-2%，显著优于现有基线。消融实验验证技术有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet是一种有效的时空图完全遗忘方法。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge.

To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Motivation: SAEs在语言领域外应用有挑战，如处理具有群对称性的科学数据时效果受限，需提升其在这些领域的有效性。

Method: 在合成图像上训练自动编码器，发现单个矩阵可解释激活如何随图像旋转而变换，开发能适应基础模型等变性水平的自适应等变SAEs。

Result: 自适应SAEs发现的特征在探测性能上优于常规SAEs。

Conclusion: 在机械可解释性工具中融入对称性具有价值。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: 新框架增强了模型透明度，有助于对SEP事件预测进行更基于物理的理解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Result: 在国际象棋中，SOLIS仅用浅搜索结合学习到的嵌入在受限条件下达到有竞争力的水平。

Conclusion: 评估对齐潜在规划是传统动力学模型或策略学习的轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL能有效解决现有强化学习训练大语言模型时存在的问题，具有较好性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: 所提的PDAC和SPDAC方法能有效解决基于排练的持续学习中核心集选择的效率问题，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了以数据为中心的AI中的冷启动问题，为主观大语言模型任务提供可扩展、经济高效的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Conclusion: 所提方法通用，适用于任何可微策略类，能有效提升强化学习效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Conclusion: GenePheno是首个可解释的多标签预测框架，能有效预测表型异常并揭示基因功能机制。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

Conclusion: NSL - MT是有限标注平行语料场景下的数据高效替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Conclusion: 所提出的MP - Init和TrSG方法有效，能解决SNN训练中的问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

Motivation: 现代数据中心作业并置导致性能干扰，现有对手检测方法存在成本高、不可扩展、测量有噪声等问题。

Method: PANDA使用每指令周期（CPI）作为性能指标，利用全局历史知识抑制采样噪声，引入机器级CPI指标捕捉多任务共享资源竞争。

Result: 在谷歌生产跟踪数据上评估，PANDA比现有方法更准确地对真正对手排序，平均怀疑百分位从50 - 55%提高到82.6%，在多受害者场景下能一致识别对手，运行时开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PANDA是一种有效的生产规模数据中心抗噪声对手识别框架。

Abstract: Modern warehouse-scale datacenters commonly collocate multiple jobs on shared machines to improve resource utilization. However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.

Abstract: As modern software systems continue to grow in complexity, triage has become a fundamental process in system operations and maintenance. Triage aims to efficiently prioritize, assign, and assess issues to ensure the reliability of complex environments. The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated by software systems has made effective triage indispensable for maintaining reliability, facilitating maintainability, and enabling rapid issue response. Motivated by these challenges, researchers have devoted extensive effort to advancing triage automation and have achieved significant progress over the past two decades. This survey provides a comprehensive review of 234 papers from 2004 to the present, offering an in-depth examination of the fundamental concepts, system architecture, and problem statement. By comparing the distinct goals of academic and industrial research and by analyzing empirical studies of industrial practices, we identify the major obstacles that limit the practical deployment of triage systems. To assist practitioners in method selection and performance evaluation, we summarize widely adopted open-source datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a unified perspective on the measurement of triage effectiveness. Finally, we outline potential future directions and emerging opportunities to foster a closer integration between academic innovation and industrial application. All reviewed papers and projects are available at https://github.com/AIOps-Lab-NKU/TriageSurvey.

Motivation: 识别稳定源代码回移植时新的技术债务产生的时间和原因。

Method: 研究三个软件生态系统（Apache、Eclipse和Python）87个仓库中31,076个回移植源的105,396次提交。

Result: 约4.3%的回移植引入新技术债务；Apache绝对实例最多，Python和Eclipse债比近Apache三倍；不同生态在不同阶段易积累债务；特定开发者更易引入债务。

Conclusion: 明确了回移植引入技术债务的比例、不同软件生态特征及易引入债务的开发者类型。

Abstract: Maintaining software is an ongoing process that stretches beyond the initial release. Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.

Motivation: 手动设计测试计划繁琐且易出错，尤其是在大型复杂系统中，需要自动化方法来减少生产环境测试活动带来的服务中断。

Method: 提出自动化生成测试计划的方法。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了该方法。

Conclusion: 自动化生成测试计划可减少生产环境测试活动导致的服务中断。

Abstract: Live testing is performed in the production environment ideally without causing unacceptable disturbance to the production traffic. Thus, test activities have to be orchestrated properly to avoid interferences with the production traffic. A test plan is the road map that specifies how the test activities need to be orchestrated. Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects.

TL;DR: 提出工业用低数据领域编码助手解决方案，不微调大模型，微调小本地模型实现高质量代码生成，评估表明RAG支持的编码助手可在低数据领域工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLC由专有代码方言操作，训练编码助手有挑战，现有LLMs存在不足，企业不信任云提供商，需自有编码代理。

Method: 让多个AI模型相互竞争，运用推理，自动纠错，在聊天界面直接编译代码检查有效性，采用大量提示工程和定向检索。

Result: 通过广泛评估，有代码编译统计和用户评级支持。

Conclusion: RAG支持的编码助手通过大量提示工程和定向检索可在低数据领域工作。

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法检测软件漏洞精度有限，主要原因是训练数据质量低。

Method: 提出SPLVD方法，根据训练阶段动态选择源代码进行模型训练，模拟人类从易到难的学习过程，有专门的数据选择器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上F1值分别达89.2%、68.7%和43.5%，在OpenHarmony项目上精度达90.9%。

Conclusion: SPLVD方法优于现有方法，具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are major risks to software systems. Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决PR中链接信息在自动化任务中被丢弃，导致评审信息不足和认知负担增加的问题。

Method: 分析50个GitHub仓库，对比Contextual LLM summaries、Non - Contextual LLM summaries和Metadata - based previews三种方法。

Result: 指标上上下文摘要表现更好，但用户研究中多数人更喜欢非上下文摘要。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的链接预览有提升代码审查效率和提供更丰富上下文的潜力。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.

Method: 集成开放权重LLM，用高级提示工程技术从软件需求中系统提取参与者和用例，并通过与五位专业软件工程师的探索性研究评估该方法。

Result: 建模时间减少60%，模型质量相当，参与者认为该方法能提供有价值的指导。

Conclusion: 大语言模型辅助用例建模可显著提高效率，同时保证模型质量。

Abstract: Use case modeling employs user-centered scenarios to outline system requirements. These help to achieve consensus among relevant stakeholders. Because the manual creation of use case models is demanding and time-consuming, it is often skipped in practice. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this tedious process. The proposed method integrates an open-weight LLM to systematically extract actors and use cases from software requirements with advanced prompt engineering techniques. The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach. The results show a substantial acceleration, reducing the modeling time by 60\%. At the same time, the model quality remains on par. Besides improving the modeling efficiency, the participants indicated that the method provided valuable guidance in the process.

Result: 发现定义广泛的关注点和实践很重要，尤其强调指定代理应遵循的架构。

Conclusion: 强调在代理配置文件中定义广泛关注点和实践的重要性，特别是架构方面。

Abstract: Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.

Motivation: 现有LLM处理软件相关任务性能差异大，且先前工作主要是通用LLM黑盒路由，需更好的软件相关任务路由方法。

Method: Routesplain先从每个查询中提取可解释概念，再基于这些概念进行路由。

Result: 在16个先进LLM和8个软件相关任务上评估，Routesplain在准确性和成本上优于单个模型，与或超过所有黑盒基线。

Conclusion: Routesplain表现良好，概念级干预为路由器进一步改进指明方向。

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

Motivation: 2008年金融危机暴露银行系统脆弱性，现有框架未整合空间传播和网络传染机制，需分析系统性风险动态。

Method: 使用28个国家156家机构的双边暴露数据（2007 - 2023），结合网络拉普拉斯算子的谱分析和空间双重差分识别方法。

Result: 银行合并增加系统脆弱性；金融传染全球传播，与技术扩散尺度差异大；传统方法高估危机影响；危机影响随时间放大；银行合并悖论中耦合强度和系统脆弱性高度相关；网络定向资本要求政策效果更佳。

Conclusion: 准确的系统性风险评估和宏观审慎政策设计需明确纳入空间传播和网络拓扑。

Abstract: The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in interconnected banking systems, yet existing frameworks fail to integrate spatial propagation with network contagion mechanisms. This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.

Result: 确定了不同不确定性集下失真风险度量的极值及对应分布，应用于稳健投资组合优化和模型风险评估。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于在模型不确定情况下改进决策。

Abstract: We establish sharp upper and lower bounds for distortion risk metrics under distributional uncertainty. The uncertainty sets are characterized by four key features of the underlying distribution: mean, variance, unimodality, and Wasserstein distance to a reference distribution.
  We first examine very general distortion risk metrics, assuming only finite variation for the underlying distortion function and without requiring continuity or monotonicity. This broad framework includes notable distortion risk metrics such as range value-at-risk, glue value-at-risk, Gini deviation, mean-median deviation and inter-quantile difference. In this setting, when the uncertainty set is characterized by a fixed mean, variance and a Wasserstein distance, we determine both the worst- and best-case values of a given distortion risk metric and identify the corresponding extremal distribution. When the uncertainty set is further constrained by unimodality with a fixed inflection point, we establish for the case of absolutely continuous distortion functions the extremal values along with their respective extremal distributions. We apply our results to robust portfolio optimization and model risk assessment offering improved decision-making under model uncertainty.

Abstract: We present the first application of federated learning (FL) to the U.S. National Financial Capability Study, introducing an interpretable framework for predicting consumer financial distress across all 50 states and the District of Columbia without centralizing sensitive data. Our cross-silo FL setup treats each state as a distinct data silo, simulating real-world governance in nationwide financial systems. Unlike prior work, our approach integrates two complementary explainable AI techniques to identify both global (nationwide) and local (state-specific) predictors of financial hardship, such as contact from debt collection agencies. We develop a machine learning model specifically suited for highly categorical, imbalanced survey data. This work delivers a scalable, regulation-compliant blueprint for early warning systems in finance, demonstrating how FL can power socially responsible AI applications in consumer credit risk and financial inclusion.

TL;DR: 研究TLLM在金融数据上表现，发现固定推理预算下TLLM排名质量随截面复杂度增加而下降，有高方差，投资组合结果不支持其优势，目前不适合替代传统或直接方法。


<details>

Motivation: 探究TLLM在噪声大、重尾和制度切换的金融数据上是否比直接LLM有更好的泛化能力。

Method: 以印度股票为样本，进行滚动评估，对比直接LLM、TLLM和传统学习器在多项指标上的表现，用多种统计检验测量统计置信度。

Result: 固定预算下TLLM排名质量随截面复杂度增加变差，方差高，投资组合结果不支持其净优势。

Conclusion: 在短期股票排名中，TLLM尚不能替代传统或直接方法，需扩大推理预算或重新调整目标。

Abstract: Problem. "Thinking" LLMs (TLLMs) expose explicit or hidden reasoning traces and are widely believed to generalize better on complex tasks than direct LLMs. Whether this promise carries to noisy, heavy-tailed and regime-switching financial data remains unclear.
  Approach. Using Indian equities (NIFTY constituents), we run a rolling 48m/1m walk-forward evaluation at horizon k = 1 day and dial cross-sectional complexity via the universe size U in {5, 11, 21, 36} while keeping the reasoning budget fixed (B = 512 tokens) for the TLLM. We compare a direct LLM (gpt-4o-mini), a TLLM (gpt-5), and classical learners (ridge, random forest) on cross-sectional ranking loss 1 - IC, MSE, and long/short backtests with realistic costs. Statistical confidence is measured with Diebold-Mariano, Pesaran-Timmermann, and SPA tests.
  Main findings.
  (i) As U grows under a fixed budget B, the TLLM's ranking quality deteriorates, whereas the direct LLM remains flat and classical baselines are stable.
  (ii) TLLM variance is higher, requiring ex-post calibration (winsorization and blending) for stability.
  (iii) Portfolio results under transaction costs do not support a net advantage for the TLLM.
  Hypotheses. Our results are consistent with the following testable hypotheses:
  H1 (Capacity-Complexity Mismatch): for fixed B, TLLM accuracy degrades superlinearly in cross-sectional complexity.
  H2 (Reasoning Variance): TLLM outputs exhibit higher dispersion date-by-date than direct LLMs, increasing error bars and turnover.
  H3 (Domain Misfit): next-token prediction objectives and token-budgeted inference are poorly aligned with heavy-tailed, weakly predictable stock returns.
  Implication. In our setting, "thinking" LLMs are not yet ready to replace classical or direct methods for short-horizon stock ranking; scaling the reasoning budget and/or re-aligning objectives appears necessary.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

Abstract: The financial industry's growing demand for advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities has highlighted the limitations of generalist large language models (LLMs) in handling domain-specific financial tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM Pro Finance Suite, a collection of five instruction-tuned LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) specifically designed for financial applications. Our approach focuses on enhancing generalist instruction-tuned models, leveraging their existing strengths in instruction following, reasoning, and toxicity control, while fine-tuning them on a curated, high-quality financial corpus comprising over 50% finance-related data in English, French, and German.
  We evaluate the LLM Pro Finance Suite on a comprehensive financial benchmark suite, demonstrating consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in finance-oriented tasks and financial translation. Notably, our models maintain the strong general-domain capabilities of their base models, ensuring reliable performance across non-specialized tasks. This dual proficiency, enhanced financial expertise without compromise on general abilities, makes the LLM Pro Finance Suite an ideal drop-in replacement for existing LLMs in financial workflows, offering improved domain-specific performance while preserving overall versatility. We publicly release two 8B-parameters models to foster future research and development in financial NLP applications: https://huggingface.co/collections/DragonLLM/llm-open-finance.

Result: MLF能结合不同长度的多周期输入，提高预测准确性，减少训练时选择输入长度的成本。

Conclusion: MLF可有效提升金融时间序列预测性能，兼顾准确性和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF.

Abstract: We investigate a number of Artificial Neural Network architectures (well-known and more ``exotic'') in application to the long-term financial time-series forecasts of indexes on different global markets. The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.

Motivation: 当前解决未来最优控制问题的强化学习和在线学习方法与PAC学习数学上不同，需扩展PAC学习框架解决非平稳环境下的学习与控制问题。

Method: 扩展PAC学习框架得到'前瞻性控制'框架，证明相关理论，并以觅食任务为例对比。

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

Conclusion: NPLM可作为强大的验证方法，还能诊断数据中建模不佳的区域。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.

Conclusion: Branching Flows框架可行，能解决元素数量未知问题，具备新能力。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]

Conclusion: 强调全面评估必要，现代架构是数据驱动材料科学中开发替代模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbarΩ$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by "temporal fuzziness," enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination. Note: Numerical comparisons with methods reporting results on nuScenes are indicative only, as nuPlan presents a more challenging planning-focused evaluation.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

Conclusion: TTM是一种有效的视频生成框架，无需额外训练和运行成本，能实现精确的运动和外观控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Conclusion: 所提方法性能优于现有基线，在实际场景中具有鲁棒性，代码将开源。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Conclusion: 所提模型有在现实安全关键场景部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

Conclusion: RS - Net能解决关系的长尾分布问题，可轻松集成到现有DSGG模型，性能优越。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Result: 基于SAS - SSM的SasMamba模型在3D姿态估计中参数显著少于现有混合模型，且性能有竞争力。

Conclusion: SAS - SSM能在维持线性计算复杂度的同时灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升生成输出多样性，为FGM发展提供理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Result: AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化情况下提取准确率超98%，在打印扫描场景也有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig能有效解决静态扫描签名的认证问题，实现“一签名一用”策略。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: Owl框架有效减少大视觉语言模型的对象幻觉，代码开源。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多无人机监控系统在动态相机位置和复杂遮挡场景下表现不佳，需要更好的数据集和方法。

Method: 引入MATRIX数据集，采用实时相机校准、基于特征的图像配准和多视图特征融合的深度学习框架。

Result: 静态相机方法在复杂环境性能下降，提出的方法检测和跟踪准确率约90%，轨迹跟踪约80%，有泛化能力和实际鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供重要基准。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长时程一致性，现有世界建模努力局限于特定领域且泛化能力弱，因此需开发通用世界模型。

Method: PAN采用生成式潜在预测（GLP）架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动力学主干和视频扩散解码器，在大规模视频 - 动作对上训练。

Result: PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长时程预测和模拟推理方面性能优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN向通用世界模型迈进了一步，可用于未来世界状态的预测模拟以进行推理和行动。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Motivation: 探索自回归下一个像素预测这一简单、端到端但研究较少的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性。

Method: 从32x32分辨率图像开始，使用IsoFlops配置在高达7e19 FLOPs的计算预算下训练一系列Transformer，并评估三个不同目标指标。

Result: 最优缩放策略与任务相关，32x32分辨率下图像分类和生成的最优缩放特性不同；分辨率增加时模型大小增长快于数据大小；主要瓶颈是计算资源。

Conclusion: 随着计算资源每年增长四到五倍，预测未来五年内逐像素图像建模可行。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Method: 设计NAMEA，首次将集成模型非注意力区域梯度融入迭代梯度优化，通过元学习合并注意力和非注意力区域梯度。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，NAMEA平均比AdaEA和SMER分别高15.0%和9.6%。

Conclusion: 首次探索集成非注意力区域在提升跨架构可迁移性上的作用，为集成攻击提供新见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过迭代视觉优化实现鲁棒、域不变定位，新基准为基于视觉的支气管镜导航标准化发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D框架在3D人体姿态估计中有效，能处理时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Conclusion: SAMora有效解决了SAM在少量标注数据下的性能问题，表现出色。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

Conclusion: Swin - UNETR框架可实现全自动、无逆向的fluence map预测，提高了准确性和效率，为自动IMRT计划生成提供可扩展且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

Conclusion: 该模型无需数据增强和大量预处理，适合小数据集，拓扑特征与深度学习特征不同，有与其他模型结合的潜力。

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

Motivation: 传统数值求解器处理多相流系统计算挑战大，现有神经算子在多相流系统中难以实现高分辨率数值精度，主要因多相流的空间异质性和高质量训练数据稀缺。

Method: 提出Interface Information - Aware Neural Operator (IANO)框架，包含接口感知多函数编码机制和几何感知位置编码机制。

Result: IANO在多相流模拟中精度比基线模型高约10%，在数据稀缺和噪声干扰条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IANO框架能有效利用接口信息作为物理先验，提升多相流系统预测精度。

Abstract: Multiphase flow systems, with their complex dynamics, field discontinuities, and interphase interactions, pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical solvers. While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.

Conclusion: 该框架为有弹性的自主检查架构提供了统一的、信息驱动的基础。

Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.

Conclusion: 所提方法在非线性系统状态估计和线性二次调节方面表现良好。

Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.

Result: 在自定义MAMO粒子环境和标准MOMALand基准测试中，访问全局偏好和AA - MAMORL显著提升了性能，持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AA - MAMORL框架能有效应对MAMOS优化问题，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 改进后的方法在在线LMAPF - T设置中达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: 改进后的PIBT能解决原方法在特定场景的不足，且结合其他技术可实现更好效果。

Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.

Abstract: Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.

We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures.

Abstract: Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Smart contracts have significantly advanced blockchain technology, and digital signatures are crucial for reliable verification of contract authority. Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.

Conclusion: GeNIS数据集支持基于时间和数量的行为特征的智能入侵检测和网络攻击分类。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a promising approach to tackle the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. However, since Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data, the lack of diverse and up-to-date datasets hinders their generalization capability to detect malicious activity in previously unseen network traffic. This study presents an experimental validation of the reliability of the GeNIS dataset for AI-based NIDS, to serve as a baseline for future benchmarks. Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks. All models reached high accuracy and F1-scores, and the ML ensembles achieved slightly better generalization while remaining more efficient than DL models. Overall, the obtained results indicate that the GeNIS dataset supports intelligent intrusion detection and cyberattack classification with time-based and quantity-based behavioral features.

Conclusion: iSeal方法能有效抵抗验证时的攻击，可靠地进行大语言模型所有权验证。

Abstract: Given the high cost of large language model (LLM) training from scratch, safeguarding LLM intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly crucial. As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗联邦学习需在资源受限的医疗机构间保证强隐私和计算效率。

Method: 提出MedHE框架，引入带误差补偿的动态阈值机制进行top - k梯度选择。

Result: 实现97.5%通信减少，准确率达89.5%±0.8%，每次训练轮通信量从1277 MB减至32 MB。

Conclusion: MedHE在符合HIPAA且可扩展至超100个机构的实际医疗部署中具有可行性。

Abstract: Healthcare federated learning requires strong privacy guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency across resource-constrained medical institutions. This paper presents MedHE, a novel framework combining adaptive gradient sparsification with CKKS homomorphic encryption to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning on sensitive medical data. Our approach introduces a dynamic threshold mechanism with error compensation for top-k gradient selection, achieving 97.5 percent communication reduction while preserving model utility. We provide formal security analysis under Ring Learning with Errors assumptions and demonstrate differential privacy guarantees with epsilon less than or equal to 1.0. Statistical testing across 5 independent trials shows MedHE achieves 89.5 percent plus or minus 0.8 percent accuracy, maintaining comparable performance to standard federated learning (p=0.32) while reducing communication from 1277 MB to 32 MB per training round. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates practical feasibility for real-world medical deployments with HIPAA compliance and scalability to 100 plus institutions.

*Taifeng Liu,Xinjing Liu,Liangqiu Dong,Yang Liu,Yilong Yang,Zhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出SAE方法增强对抗样本（AEs）对类增量学习（CIL）的可持续性，有语义校正和过滤增强模块，实验表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AEs针对静态模型设计，CIL使模型更新，现有AEs因域漂移失效，需增强AEs对CIL的可持续性。

Method: 提出SAE，核心是增强AE语义对域漂移的鲁棒性；提出语义校正模块，用视觉语言模型使AE语义泛化，结合CIL模型校正优化方向；提出过滤增强模块，识别潜在空间中有目标类语义的非目标样本并增强。

Result: 综合实验表明，当类别数量增加9倍更新时，SAE平均比基线高31.28%。

Conclusion: SAE能有效增强AEs对CIL的可持续性，在实验中表现良好。

Abstract: Current adversarial examples (AEs) are typically designed for static models. However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes.

TL;DR: 提出自动可扩展方法在工业规模网表生成类似硬件木马模式以压力测试检测工具，框架缩小学术电路和现代SoC评估差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级片上系统规模大，对硬件木马检测器进行实证评估必要但困难，现有公开基准规模小且为手工制作，发布恶意RTL有风险。

Method: 将大型门级设计解析为连接图，用SCOAP可测试性指标探索稀有区域，应用保留功能的图变换合成模仿隐蔽硬件木马统计特征的触发-有效负载对。

Result: 在生成的基准上，代表性的先进图学习模型未能检测出木马。

Conclusion: 框架通过提供可重现的挑战实例缩小评估差距，推动安全研究且不泄露攻击指令。

Abstract: Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.

Result: 评估结果显示真实排名和匿名排名之间有强到非常强的统计相关性，保证了强大的隐私参数。

Conclusion: 所提出的集成方法能在排名问题中有效保护个人贡献隐私。

Abstract: Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of Operations Research that helps decision-makers in choosing, ranking, or sorting alternatives based on conflicting criteria. Over time, its application has been expanded into dynamic and data-driven domains, such as recommender systems. In these contexts, the availability and handling of personal and sensitive data can play a critical role in the decision-making process. Despite this increased reliance on sensitive data, the integration of privacy mechanisms with MCDM methods is underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated approach that combines MCDM outranking methods with Differential Privacy (DP), safeguarding individual contributions' privacy in ranking problems. This approach relies on a pre-processing step to aggregate multiple user evaluations into a comprehensive performance matrix. The evaluation results show a strong to very strong statistical correlation between the true rankings and their anonymized counterparts, ensuring robust privacy parameter guarantees.

Motivation: 传统分布式后门攻击需要更多中毒数据来维持攻击强度，增加暴露风险，因此需改进。

Method: 提出FTDBA方法，利用分形自相似性增强子触发器特征强度；引入动态角扰动机制自适应调整扰动强度。

Result: FTDBA用传统DBA方法62.4%的中毒数据量实现92.3%的攻击成功率，降低22.8%的检测率和41.2%的KL散度。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦后门攻击提供低暴露、高效率范式，拓展分形特征在对抗样本生成中的应用。

Abstract: Traditional distributed backdoor attacks (DBA) in federated learning improve stealthiness by decomposing global triggers into sub-triggers, which however requires more poisoned data to maintian the attck strength and hence increases the exposure risk. To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\% attack success rate with only 62.4\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\% and KL divergence by 41.2\%. This study presents a low-exposure, high-efficiency paradigm for federated backdoor attacks and expands the application of fractal features in adversarial sample generation.

Abstract: Model watermarking techniques can embed watermark information into the protected model for ownership declaration by constructing specific input-output pairs. However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness.

Method: 实现并评估密码强度评分系统，对比RF、SVM、CNN和逻辑回归四种机器学习模型，采用新的混合特征工程方法。

Result: RF模型表现最优，在测试集上准确率达99.12%，且可进行特征重要性分析。

Conclusion: 该研究弥合预测准确性和实用性差距，构建高性能评分系统，减少密码漏洞，助用户做安全决策。

Abstract: Password security plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, yet traditional password strength meters, which rely on static rules like character-type requirements, often fail. Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics. We introduce features like leetspeak-normalized Shannon entropy to assess true randomness, pattern detection for keyboard walks and sequences, and character-level TF-IDF n-grams to identify frequently reused substrings from breached password datasets. our RF model achieved superior performance, achieving 99.12% accuracy on a held-out test set. Crucially, the interpretability of the Random Forest model allows for feature importance analysis, providing a clear pathway to developing security tools that offer specific, actionable feedback to users. This study bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and practical usability, resulting in a high-performance scoring system that not only reduces password-based vulnerabilities but also empowers users to make more informed security decisions.

Method: 创建福利数据集，用方差膨胀因子处理特征相关性，对市场份额变量分类，构建多项式Lasso模型并使用5折交叉验证调参。

Result: 不同类别重要变量不同，品牌、PPO计划、处方药覆盖影响市场份额，附加福利影响小，财务条款与高市场份额相关，模型预测准确率0.76。

Conclusion: 品牌、PPO计划、处方药覆盖和财务条款对医保优势健康计划的市场份额有重要影响，可据此优化计划。

Abstract: We seek to identify the most relevant benefits offered by Medicare Advantage Health Plans that drive membership and market share. As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\%, 0.3\% to 1.5\%, and over 1.5\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share. Finally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Lasso model with the test set. The accuracy is 0.76.

Conclusion: 大语言模型构建的生成式智能体在确定策略采用概率上具有有效性，人工市场分析能帮助过滤智能体决策过程，市场存在对基本面分析行为的偏好。

Abstract: Results in the Heterogeneous Agent Model (HAM) literature determine the proportion of fundamentalists and trend followers in the financial market. This proportion varies according to the periods analyzed. In this paper, we use a large language model (LLM) to construct a generative agent (GA) that determines the probability of adopting one of the two strategies based on current information. The probabilities of strategy adoption are compared with those in the HAM literature for the S\&P 500 index between 1990 and 2020. Our findings suggest that the resulting artificial intelligence (AI) expectations align with those reported in the HAM literature. At the same time, extending the analysis to artificial market data helps us to filter the decision-making process of the AI agent. In the artificial market, results confirm the heterogeneity in expectations but reveal systematic asymmetry toward the fundamentalist behavior.

Method: 按照PRISMA指南系统搜索五个学术数据库和灰色文献，纳入53项符合标准的实证研究，评估研究的偏倚风险，因结果和研究设计异质性大，采用叙述性综合而非元分析。

Result: 少数高偏倚风险研究称无系统性不利社会影响，大量采用更强准实验设计的研究表明IMF条件性条款会导致更高收入不平等、更差健康结果和非正规经济增长。

Conclusion: 现有最佳证据表明IMF项目带来显著社会成本，需重新设计条件性条款以保护社会支出和推进可持续发展目标。

Abstract: This systematic review with narrative synthesis examines the social impacts of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. We systematically searched five academic databases and grey literature following PRISMA guidelines and included 53 empirical studies that met predefined eligibility criteria. For each study we assessed risk of bias, with particular attention to how endogeneity, selection bias, and confounding were handled. Because of substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and research designs, results were synthesized narratively rather than through meta analysis. We find that a minority of studies, often using methods with higher risk of bias such as propensity score matching, report no systematic adverse social effects. By contrast, a large body of work using stronger quasi experimental designs, especially instrumental variable strategies, links IMF conditionality to higher income inequality, worse health outcomes (notably tuberculosis and child mortality), and growth of the informal economy. Overall, the best available evidence indicates that IMF programs, particularly those centered on fiscal austerity and structural reforms, impose significant social costs and that a redesign of conditionality is needed to protect social spending and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract: Energy imbalance reserve (EIR) product is introduced into the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England's day-ahead wholesale electricity market to provide a better fuel procurement incentive for generating resources. Different from existing forward reserve products, EIR is a novel real option product, which is settled against real-time energy price rather than reserve prices. This novel product has not been analyzed in the research literature in terms of its effects. In this paper, we develop a stochastic long-run equilibrium model that incorporates the risk preference of generator and demand agents participating in the energy and reserve market in both day-ahead and real-time time frame. In a risk neutral environment, we find that the presence of the EIR product makes little difference on market outcomes. We also conduct a series of numerical simulations with risk-averse generators and demand, and observed increased advanced fuel procurement when the EIR product is present.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have significantly lowered the cost of producing written content. This paper studies how LLMs, through lowering writing costs, disrupt markets that traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify the extent to which an application is tailored to a given job posting. Taking the measure to the data, we find that employers have a high willingness to pay for workers with more customized applications in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. To isolate and quantify the effect of LLMs' disruption of signaling on equilibrium outcomes, we develop and estimate a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We use the estimated model to simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs render written applications useless in signaling workers' ability. Without costly signaling, employers are less able to identify high-ability workers, causing the market to become significantly less meritocratic: compared to the pre-LLM equilibrium, workers in the top quintile of the ability distribution are hired 19% less often, workers in the bottom quintile are hired 14% more often.

Conclusion: 给出经济稳态和衰退期的最优政策响应。

Abstract: Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. We show that the long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated with the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit. We use the model and quasi-exogenous variation in demand to estimate love-of-variety. We find it to be significantly higher than implied by CES aggregation, suggesting that even the long-run effects of recessions are negative. Finally, we quantitatively characterize the optimal policy response both along the transition and in the steady state.

Abstract: Higher education often requires choosing a bachelor's and a master's degree, yet the returns of these combined choices and the role of courses in different disciplines remain understudied. This paper addresses this gap using detailed data on Italian graduates and university programs. I study the labor market returns to combinations of bachelor's and master's degrees and investigate how curriculum characteristics affect outcomes. I exploit exogenous variation in access to bachelor's and master's degrees to causally estimate the returns to 43 combinations of degrees. I organize the data in a nested model with exogenous variation in admission requirements and explore the preference profile of the sample through policy simulations that shift these requirements. I then relate the estimated returns to the academic curriculum of degrees, focusing on the role of quantitative education and timing of courses. I contribute to the literature on returns to advanced degrees by incorporating master's degrees in the discussion on how higher education affects outcomes and providing evidence on the characteristics of curricula that are positively related to labor market returns. The findings reveal substantial variation in returns to degree combinations, even among combinations with the same bachelor's degree, indicating the need to consider both types of programs. Combinations of degrees in different disciplines positively impact economic outcomes, while those in the same field perform worse. Successful combinations feature more non-quantitative education in the bachelor's, and quantitative courses alone do not explain higher returns.

Conclusion: 紧凑型自编码器架构可通过稳定简单的训练有效学习结构化、代数最优的二进制码。

Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将深度神经网络嵌入混合整数规划的整体线性化方法规模爆炸且难处理。

Method: 引入双分解框架，用增广拉格朗日乘子松弛耦合等式，将问题拆为普通MIP和受限NN块，用分支切割法解MIP子问题，用一阶优化解NN子问题。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，比精确Big - M公式快120倍；可无代码改动换NN子求解器；换LSTM骨干仍能47秒完成优化。

Conclusion: 所提方法具有可扩展性、模块化和适应性。

Abstract: Embedding deep neural networks (NNs) into mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is attractive for decision making with learned constraints, yet state-of-the-art monolithic linearisations blow up in size and quickly become intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-decomposition framework that relaxes the single coupling equality u=x with an augmented Lagrange multiplier and splits the problem into a vanilla MIP and a constrained NN block. Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \textbf{scalable}, \textbf{modular}, and \textbf{adaptable}: it runs \(120\times\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation.

Motivation: 拓展经典和基于范数的鲁棒公式，解决最小二乘问题。

Method: 将最小二乘解释为强制测量和真实数据空间之间的近似子空间包含，在格拉斯曼流形上用度量球建模不确定性，转化为最小 - 最大问题。

Result: 内最大化有闭式解，得到高效算法；应用于鲁棒有限时域线性二次跟踪时，改进了现有鲁棒最小二乘公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在小不确定性下实现了更强的鲁棒性和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: The paper studies a geometrically robust least-squares problem that extends classical and norm-based robust formulations. Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty.

Result: 数值研究表明模型在样本外和分布外满足约束条件。

Conclusion: 模型在提供鲁棒高效的虚拟能源服务方面有有效性和潜力。

Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.

<details>

Motivation: 解决在有证据条件下，即使对于无证据时可处理的逻辑片段，WFOMC也无法在多项式时间内计算的问题。

Method: 将二元证据限制为底层Gaifman图具有有界树宽，提出多项式时间算法。

Result: 提出了针对二变量片段$	ext{FO}^2$和$	ext{C}^2$在特定二元证据条件下计算WFOMC的多项式时间算法，解决了有界度有界树宽图上的稳定座位安排问题，并通过实验展示了算法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在解决WFOMC问题上具有有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. Conditioning WFOMC on evidence -- fixing the truth values of a set of ground literals -- has been shown impossible in time polynomial in the domain size (unless $\mathsf{\#P \subseteq FP}$) even for fragments of logic that are otherwise tractable for WFOMC without evidence. In this work, we address the barrier by restricting the binary evidence to the case where the underlying Gaifman graph has bounded treewidth. We present a polynomial-time algorithm in the domain size for computing WFOMC for the two-variable fragments $\text{FO}^2$ and $\text{C}^2$ conditioned on such binary evidence. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our algorithm in combinatorial problems by solving the stable seating arrangement problem on bounded-treewidth graphs of bounded degree, which was an open problem. We also conducted experiments to show the scalability of our algorithm compared to the existing model counting solvers.

Motivation: 现有离散时间机器人模拟器需用户选择时间步，存在问题，现有连续时间误差控制积分器难以处理接触的刚性动力学，无法满足现代机器人工作流的速度和可扩展性要求。

Method: 引入CENIC连续时间积分器，结合凸时间步和误差控制积分的最新进展。

Result: CENIC能以与离散时间机器人模拟器相当的快速实时速率运行，同时保证精度和收敛性。

Conclusion: CENIC解决了现有模拟器的问题，结合了连续积分和离散时间步的优点。

Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Conclusion: 该方法为实现更强大的具身智能体指明方向。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Conclusion: 这些改进使MAC更具扩展性、可靠性，适合实时估计应用。

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型依赖专家演示，难以从失败中学习和自我纠正，强化学习在真实机器人上样本复杂度高。

Method: 引入WMPO框架，聚焦基于像素的预测，使“想象”轨迹与预训练的VLA特征对齐，支持策略进行在线GRPO。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人环境中，WMPO显著提高样本效率，实现更强整体性能，展现自我纠正等行为，具备鲁棒泛化和终身学习能力。

Conclusion: WMPO是一种有效的无真实环境交互的VLA强化学习框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

Conclusion: 通过结合互联网规模模型和模拟管道的优势，可在无手动收集训练数据的情况下实现高性能语义抓取。

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

Motivation: 现有视频转音乐方法存在缺乏明确节奏建模和有效集成视觉特征两大挑战，需解决这些问题。

Method: 提出基于分层条件扩散模型的Diff - V2M框架，包括视觉特征提取和条件音乐生成；评估多种节奏表示，设计节奏预测器；提取语义和情感特征，通过分层交叉注意力机制融入生成器；引入时间步感知融合策略。

Conclusion: Diff - V2M能有效解决现有视频转音乐方法的问题，实现视听时间对齐和视觉特征的有效集成。

Abstract: Video-to-music (V2M) generation aims to create music that aligns with visual content. However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons. Demo and code are available at https://Tayjsl97.github.io/Diff-V2M-Demo/.

Result: 通过性能评估和两个不同数据集的用例，表明TempoQL在保持精度、速度和可重复性的同时，简化了机器学习队列的创建。

Conclusion: TempoQL能有效降低EHR数据提取和验证的障碍，适用于机器学习模型构建。

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.

Motivation: 研究算法建议如何影响经典经济博弈中人类行为，以及其对战略市场动态的作用。

Method: 进行两个预注册实验，分别是有个性化或集体算法建议的伯特兰价格竞争实验和有均衡对齐或战略偏差算法建议的古诺产量竞争实验。

Result: 实验1中，有偏差的建议起初使价格上升，后向均衡收敛，建议是可接受价格的软上限；实验2中，个性化均衡建议促进稳定收敛，有偏差建议导致隐性合谋；参与者对个性化建议反应更强烈一致。

Conclusion: 算法建议可作为战略信号影响协调，需对竞争环境中的算法决策支持系统进行谨慎设计和监管。

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.

Abstract: Measuring GUI task difficulty is crucial for user behavior analysis and agent capability evaluation. Yet, existing benchmarks typically quantify difficulty based on motor actions (e.g., step counts), overlooking the cognitive demands underlying task completion. In this work, we propose Cognitive Chain, a novel framework that models task difficulty from a cognitive perspective. A cognitive chain decomposes the cognitive processes preceding a motor action into a sequence of cognitive steps (e.g., finding, deciding, computing), each with a difficulty index grounded in information theories. We develop an LLM-based method to automatically extract cognitive chains from task execution traces. Validation with linear regression shows that our estimated cognitive difficulty correlates well with user completion time (step-level R-square=0.46 after annotation). Assessment of state-of-the-art GUI agents shows reduced success on cognitively demanding tasks, revealing capability gaps and Human-AI consistency patterns. We conclude by discussing potential applications in agent training, capability assessment, and human-agent delegation optimization.

Abstract: AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to integrate a dedicated safety layer. It introduces an adaptive AI safety infrastructure capable of dynamically learning and mitigating attacks against the AI system. The system leverages the inherent advantages of co-location with the edge computing hardware to continuously monitor, detect and proactively mitigate threats to the AI system. The integration of local processing and learning capabilities enhances resilience against emerging network-based attacks while simultaneously improving system reliability, modularity, and performance, all with minimal cost and 3D integration overhead.

Conclusion: 提出的方法是一种高效、可扩展的曲率感知SDF学习替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新兴的基于区块链技术的DAOs如何挑战传统集中式治理结构。

Method: 分析DAOs的特点、应用范围，列举其机遇和挑战，探讨与人工智能的结合情况。

Result: 指出DAOs存在激励对齐、快速协调等机遇，也有代币集中、参与度低等挑战；与AI结合有自动化潜力但存在人类监督不足等危险。

Conclusion: 讨论DAOs在何种情况下能实现民主承诺或重蹈权力不对称覆辙。

Abstract: This chapter explores how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a novel institutional form based on blockchain technology, challenge traditional centralized governance structures. DAOs govern projects ranging from finance to science and digital communities. They aim to redistribute decision-making power through programmable, transparent, and participatory mechanisms. This chapter outlines both the opportunities DAOs present, such as incentive alignment, rapid coordination, and censorship resistance, and the challenges they face, including token concentration, low participation, and the risk of de facto centralization. It further discusses the emerging intersection of DAOs and artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for increased automation alongside the dangers of diminished human oversight and algorithmic opacity. Ultimately, we discuss under what circumstances DAOs can fulfill their democratic promise or risk replicating the very power asymmetries they seek to overcome.

TL;DR: 本文介绍为瑞典住房合作社设计的对话代理系统SPARA，利用RAG框架与语言模型提供能源效率建议，初步结果良好，后续需评估技术局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑞典住房合作社董事会成员缺乏管理物业和能源消耗的资源与专业知识，且欧盟有能源等级限制，需要工具支持能源改造和使用决策。

Method: 引入对话代理系统SPARA，利用RAG框架与语言模型，基于专业能源顾问和合作社代表的邮件通信知识库生成建议。

Result: SPARA能提供能源效率建议，精度达80%，与市政能源效率专家相当，正在进行试点评估。

Conclusion: 语言模型可支持利益相关者能源转型，未来需评估该技术稳定性和可信度等局限性。

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

TL;DR: 研究在阿富汗系统教育受限期间，将Snyder希望量表改编用于衡量136名在线学习编程女性的教育抱负，结果显示量表可靠，可用于评估教育技术设计影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前衡量抱负的可扩展指标有限，需要在社会政治不稳定背景下设计有影响力的教育技术，需深入理解教育抱负。

Method: 对Snyder希望量表进行改编、翻译和评估，以衡量阿富汗受教育限制期间在线学习编程的136名女性的抱负。

Result: 改编后的量表信度良好（Cronbach's α = 0.78），参与者认为其易懂且相关；整体抱负得分与是否使用大语言模型无显著差异，但使用模型者在途径子量表得分略高。

Conclusion: 支持在社会政治不稳定背景下使用改编后的量表衡量抱负，也可用于评估以抱负驱动的教育技术设计的影响。

Abstract: Designing impactful educational technologies in contexts of socio-political instability requires a nuanced understanding of educational aspirations. Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability. More broadly, the adapted scale can be used to evaluate the impact of aspiration-driven design of educational technologies.

TL;DR: 研究DataComp数据集中数据所有者数据使用同意情况，发现当前AI数据收集未充分尊重所有者意愿，需统一数据同意框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网是训练模型的主要数据来源，但数据收集是否尊重所有者意愿存疑，还引发伦理和版权问题，故开展研究。

Method: 检查样本级信息（版权声明、水印、元数据）和网站域级信息（服务条款、机器人排除协议）。

Result: CommonPool至少1.22亿样本有版权声明，前50域名中60%样本来自禁止抓取网站，9 - 13%样本有水印且现有检测方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 数据所有者通过多种渠道传达数据同意，当前AI数据收集管道未完全尊重，需考虑AI用途的统一数据同意框架。

Abstract: The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\% with 95\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.

Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.

Motivation: 此前AI生成播客未作为媒体被分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 上传不同类型文本并分析生成的输出。

Result: 播客结构基于固定模板，将文本翻译成美国中西部口音，文化语境向美国中产阶级白人默认语境转换。

Conclusion: 这是媒体塑造公众方式的新发展，使播客类型从针对特定社区转向抽象化。

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

TL;DR: 研究小ANN模型在蛋白质 - RNA预测中的表现，探索不同非线性函数、训练技术等，发现高准确率预测可通过常见硬件实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大ANN模型训练需大量资源，而很多研究者难以获取，且生命科学数据集有限，因此研究小ANN模型在蛋白质 - RNA预测中的准确性。

Method: 实验使用含两个隐藏层的浅前馈ANN，采用滑动窗口隐式考虑上下文，探索不同训练技术处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: 七种非线性函数中仅ReLU、GLU和Tanh产生收敛模型；常见重平衡技术无效，增加训练数据量和使用模型集成可显著提升性能；最佳上下文窗口大小约为30个残基和碱基。

Conclusion: 使用大多数教育和研究机构可获取的计算硬件能实现高准确率的蛋白质 - RNA结合预测。

Abstract: Large Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have demonstrated success in various domains, including general text and image generation, drug discovery, and protein-RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding tasks. However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.

Conclusion: 该方法为平面网络鲁棒性分析提供了一种可解释且高效的途径。

Abstract: In spatially embedded networks such as transportation and power grids, understanding how edge removals affect connectivity is crucial for robustness analysis. This paper studies a planar graph dismantling problem under an edge-budget constraint. We propose a spanning-tree-skeleton dual-path framework that first samples multiple uniform spanning trees to capture network backbones and then adaptively selects between two complementary paths according to the budget. The small-budget path estimates a dismantlable subgraph fraction using a logarithmic density feature, while the large-budget path predicts the optimal partition count through a slope-based model. Experiments on random planar graphs demonstrate near-linear runtime scaling, consistent reductions in the largest connected component ratio, and clear budget-fragmentation trends. The method provides an interpretable and efficient approach for planar-network robustness analysis.

Abstract: Detecting the origin of information or infection spread in networks is a fundamental challenge with applications in misinformation tracking, epidemiology, and beyond. We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐射转移是计算天体物理学的关键瓶颈，需要有效解决方法。

Method: 引入Ray - trax，采用即时光发射 - 吸收近似，向量化处理射线和源，支持多频率区间，暴露端到端梯度。

Result: 验证了分析解，展示了在湍流介质中的传播，通过基于梯度的优化进行简单反问题。内存占用与源和单元格数量有关，在加速器上高效。

Conclusion: Ray - trax是解决辐射转移问题的有效工具，可与可微流体动力学求解器耦合。

Abstract: Radiative transfer is a key bottleneck in computational astrophysics: it is nonlocal, stiff, and tightly coupled to hydrodynamics. We introduce Ray-trax, a GPU-oriented, fully differentiable 3D ray tracer written in JAX that solves the time-dependent emission--absorption problem and runs directly on turbulent gas fields produced by hydrodynamic simulations. The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability. We validate against analytical solutions, demonstrate propagation in turbulent media, and perform a simple inverse problem via gradient-based optimization. In practice, the memory footprint scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{src}}\,N_{\text{cells}})$ while remaining highly efficient on accelerators.

Motivation: 实现多波束低轨星座中准确且低复杂度的定位，克服传统方法依赖几何或信道状态信息（CSI）的局限。

Method: 将策略网络与增强加权最小二乘（WLS）估计器相结合，策略直接从上行导频响应和几何特征学习，增强WLS联合估计位置和接收机时钟偏差。

Result: 在代表性场景中，与基于几何的基线方法相比，平均定位误差降低99.3%，均方根误差（RMSE）达0.395米，接近实时推理。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提高定位精度，且复杂度较低。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.

Result: 通过八名健康参与者的上肢运动分类实验验证，该方法比输入空间合成方法准确率提高约30%。

Conclusion: 提出的在结构化潜在空间合成组合运动模式的方法优于输入空间合成方法。

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可有效识别熔化平台，去除人工干预，准确确定熔化起始点和校准漂移。

Abstract: Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a "plateau" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection. They also show a cross-validated R2 of 0.99 on predictions of calibration drift.

Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

### [278] [Data-driven Feynman-Kac Discovery with Applications to Prediction and Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08606)
*Qi Feng,Guang Lin,Purav Matlia,Denny Serdarevic*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: 提出用于发现费曼 - 卡茨公式潜在概率定律的数据驱动框架，可从有限金融时间序列数据恢复BSDE并预测和生成新数据路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有识别随机微分方程方法通常需要遍历性，本文旨在消除这一假设，从有限金融时间序列数据恢复BSDE。

Method: 引入在风险中性概率测度下制定的随机SINDy方法，从单对股票和期权轨迹恢复BSDE。

Result: 该算法不仅能进行前瞻性预测，还能生成符合潜在概率定律的新合成数据路径。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动框架有效，可在消除遍历性假设下从有限数据恢复BSDE。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework for discovering probabilistic laws underlying the Feynman-Kac formula. Specifically, we introduce the first stochastic SINDy method formulated under the risk-neutral probability measure to recover the backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) from a single pair of stock and option trajectories. Unlike existing approaches to identifying stochastic differential equations-which typically require ergodicity-our framework leverages the risk-neutral measure, thereby eliminating the ergodicity assumption and enabling BSDE recovery from limited financial time series data. Using this algorithm, we are able not only to make forward-looking predictions but also to generate new synthetic data paths consistent with the underlying probabilistic law.

Method: 使用基于深度学习的数值方法。

Result: 给出了误差估计和收敛性，解决了粗糙波动率下的效用最大化问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于深度学习的方法适用于非马尔可夫框架下的全耦合正倒向随机微分方程，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we extend deep learning-based numerical methods to fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) within a non-Markovian framework. Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.

### [280] [Generalisable prediction model of surgical case duration: multicentre development and temporal validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08994)
*Daijiro Kabata,Mari Ito,Tokito Koga,Kazuma Yunoki*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本文开展回顾性多中心研究，用多变量机器学习模型预测手术时长，在外部验证中表现良好，通用工具或可改善手术室调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术时长预测模型依赖特定输入且缺乏外部验证，泛化性有限，需开发通用预测模型。

Method: 回顾性多中心研究，收集日本两家医院围手术期数据，选定术前预测因子，用多重插补处理缺失数据，采用四种学习器经内 - 外交叉验证调优后堆叠集成，预测对数转换后的手术时长。

Result: 分析63,206例手术，交叉验证中各中心和年份表现一致，2024年时间测试队列校准良好。

Conclusion: 仅使用广泛可用术前变量的堆叠机器学习模型在时间外部验证中实现准确、校准良好的预测，支持跨站点和跨时间的可移植性，通用工具可改善手术室调度。

Abstract: Background: Accurate prediction of surgical case duration underpins operating room (OR) scheduling, yet existing models often depend on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and rarely undergo external validation, limiting generalisability.
  Methods: We undertook a retrospective multicentre study using routinely collected perioperative data from two general hospitals in Japan (development: 1 January 2021-31 December 2023; temporal test: 1 January-31 December 2024). Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.
  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).
  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time. Such general-purpose tools may improve OR scheduling without relying on idiosyncratic inputs.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出端到端管道MCAD将音频描述（AD）生成扩展到体育领域，不依赖真实AD，还引入新评估指标ARGE - AD评估生成AD质量，并进行多方面分析和贡献标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化AD工作局限于高质量电影内容且依赖真实AD，要将AD生成扩展到体育领域（如足球比赛）。

Method: 在公开电影AD数据集上微调视频大语言模型学习AD叙事结构，推理时结合多模态上下文线索和输入提示生成AD文本，引入新评估指标ARGE - AD。

Result: 对电影和足球数据集进行深入分析，验证新指标跨领域评估生成AD质量的有效性。

Conclusion: MCAD能有效将AD生成扩展到体育领域，新评估指标ARGE - AD可准确评估生成AD质量。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着探测到的凌星系外行星候选体数量增加，需要强大且可扩展的自动化工具对其进行优先级排序或验证，深度学习模型有潜力。

Method: 使用10折交叉验证在Kepler Q1 - Q17 DR25数据上训练WATSON - Net，产生十个独立模型并在验证和测试集评估，校准模型并标准化输入管道以用于TESS数据。

Result: 在Kepler目标上，WATSON - Net的R@P0.99为0.903排第二；在TESS信号上，是表现最佳的非微调机器学习分类器，精度0.93，召回率0.76，模型和工具公开。

Conclusion: WATSON - Net在凌星系外行星信号筛选和验证方面表现良好，且开源可集成到相关管道。

Abstract: Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

Tele-LLM-Hub actualizes TeleMCP through a low-code interface that supports agent creation, workflow composition, and interaction with software stacks such as srsRAN. Key components include a direct chat interface, a repository of pre-built systems, an Agent Maker leveraging finetuning with our RANSTRUCT framework, and an MA-Maker for composing MA workflows. The goal of Tele-LLM-Hub is to democratize the design of contextaware MA systems and accelerate innovation in next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 解决5G非独立铁路环境早期无线电链路故障预测问题。

Method: 使用10Hz地铁列车轨迹数据，对CNN、LSTM等六个模型在不同观测窗口和预测视野下进行基准测试。

Result: 观测窗口为3秒时，TimesNet在3秒预测视野F1得分最高，CNN在2秒视野有良好的准确率 - 延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 深度时间模型可用商用设备轻量级特征提前几秒预测可靠性下降，为5G铁路系统预警控制提供实用途径。

Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

Motivation: 研究个体创业者在AI时代如何将创意转化为成功的单人企业。

Method: 基于创业、创造力和创新研究，提出包含想象塑造、现实测试、现实拓展三个关键阶段的框架。

Result: 明确了关键促成因素，如心理适应性、有效规划和人机协作；也探讨了不确定性和认知过载等挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为个体创业者在AI时代开展单人业务提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper investigates how individual entrepreneurs can turn creative ideas into successful solo businesses in an era increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business. The framework clearly identifies key enabling factors such as mental adaptability, effective planning, and successful human-AI collaboration within digital ecosystems. It also thoughtfully addresses ongoing challenges, like uncertainty and cognitive overload, which are heightened by our constant connectivity.

Conclusion: 给出解决强化学习算法在未来试验中关键挑战的模板解决方案。

Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）在复杂多步推理场景效果有限，基于结果的监督方法存在问题。

Method: 提出Bi - RAR框架，用基于Kolmogorov复杂度的双向信息距离评估中间步骤，采用多目标强化学习框架和级联奖励结构。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，Bi - RAR超越先前方法，能在训练和推理时与搜索引擎高效交互和推理。

Conclusion: Bi - RAR框架有效，能解决现有RAG在复杂推理场景的问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型可用于模拟在线社区和社交媒体，但用其模拟不同用户对话的有效性未经检验，需评估其能否逼真模拟人类群组对话。

Method: 收集Reddit上的真实人类对话，用Llama 3 70B和GPT - 4o生成相同主题的人工对话，让研究参与者并排判断。

Result: 参与者将大语言模型生成的对话误判为人类内容的比例达39%，评估Llama 3生成的对话时，参与者正确识别为AI生成的比例仅56%，略高于随机猜测。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能生成足以欺骗人类的社交媒体对话，既显示了社会模拟的潜力，也警示了其被用于生成虚假社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

Method: 引入Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP)，将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和修剪冗余步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，比现有树搜索基线快2.3倍，保持有竞争力的准确率，减少85 - 90%的探索节点数。

Conclusion: SSDP是一种高效、可扩展的LLM推理实用方法。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

Conclusion: 大量人群用大语言模型获取信息，研究结果值得警惕。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型防御假设外部攻击，未充分探索模型自身输出成攻击向量的可能，故开展研究。

Method: 提出Self - HarmLLM场景，用模型生成的MHQ重新输入同一模型单独会话，在多种模型和条件下实验，进行前缀自动评估和人工评估。

Result: 零样本条件下转换成功率达52%、越狱成功率达33%，少样本条件下转换成功率达65%、越狱成功率达41%；自动评估平均高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 虽研究有局限性，但方法是有效攻击场景，需重新考虑护栏设计和建立更稳健评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法捕捉动态世界的知识，集中式策展跟不上大模型发展。

Method: 提出OKBench自动化框架，在新闻领域自动化完成基准的来源、创建、验证和分发，评估多种不同规模和配置的大模型。

Result: 发现模型面对新信息有不同行为，检索能缩小大小模型性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调在不断发展的知识基准上评估大模型的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Motivation: 大语言模型领域适应的监督微调资源消耗大且可能导致灾难性遗忘，影响通用能力。

Method: 提出 GrADS 方法，通过分析预训练阶段的梯度识别有效训练数据子集，设计自引导标准利用梯度大小和统计分布来确定对模型学习贡献最大的样本。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融等多个领域实验表明，仅使用 5% 的 GrADS 选择数据，模型性能就超过全量数据微调的模型，使用 50% 数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS 方法在大语言模型监督微调中高效、经济，能有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，后续将发布代码。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，有自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素，很多人会在社交媒体透露自杀意图，需有效方法识别。

Method: 结合CNN架构和BiGRU技术识别自杀意念模式，用SHapley Additive exPlanations解释预测结果，在公开数据集上训练和评估系统，用多种性能指标评估。

Result: 实验结果准确率达93.97%，对比研究显示优于其他机器学习和深度学习模型。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Motivation: 解决LLM智能体因用户指令模糊导致工具调用错误和任务失败的问题。

Method: 引入工具调用参数的结构化不确定性，将联合工具 - 参数澄清建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择和基于方面的成本建模。

Result: SAGE - Agent在模糊任务上覆盖率提高7 - 39%，澄清问题减少1.5 - 2.7倍；推出ClarifyBench基准；强化学习中When2Call准确率提升。

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性是工具增强智能体的有效方法，可提高现实场景中任务成功率和交互效率。

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Method: 引入TACT数据集，支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换；提出Switch和Recovery两个新指标；在TACT上训练模型并应用DPO。

Result: 在TACT上训练的模型在意图检测和模式转换处理上优于基线；应用DPO后联合模式 - 意图准确率达75.74%，在人工评估中对GPT - 4o胜率达70.1%。

Conclusion: 结构多样的数据与DPO结合可提升响应质量和过渡控制，有助于开发更主动、过渡感知的对话代理。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Motivation: 大语言模型在引用推荐中存在虚构不存在论文的问题，研究引用频率对引用幻觉的影响。

Method: 使用GPT - 4.1在20个计算机科学领域生成并手动验证100条引用，通过余弦相似度测量生成元数据与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性强相关；引用超约1000次时，书目信息近乎逐字记忆；多篇高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 存在一个从泛化到记忆的阈值，高引用论文在模型中近乎逐字保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效平衡扩散语言模型并行生成和自回归模型质量，希望实现高吞吐量、高GPU利用率和自回归级别的质量。

Method: 引入TiDAR序列级混合架构，利用扩散起草令牌，自回归采样最终输出，使用特殊设计的结构化注意力掩码。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模的生成和似然任务中，TiDAR吞吐量优于投机解码，效率和质量超过扩散模型，与自回归模型质量差距缩小，每秒生成令牌数是其4.71 - 5.91倍。

Conclusion: TiDAR架构能有效平衡并行生成和质量，是一种高效且服务友好的模型架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型路由方法未完全个性化，难以捕捉用户与模型复杂交互，且用户偏好数据稀缺、嘈杂、格式不一致。

Method: 将多轮用户 - 大语言模型交互表示为包含四种节点类型的异构图，通过定制消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好。

Result: GMTRouter在多数据集上始终优于强基线，准确率提高0.9 - 21.6%，AUC提高0.006 - 0.309，能利用少样本数据适应新用户和偏好变化。

Conclusion: GMTRouter在大语言模型路由个性化方面表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Conclusion: 该方法能产生可审计的逻辑工件，可证实验证结果并改进原文。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型工具学习中静态合成数据管道存在问题，无法自适应关注模型弱点，存在噪声标签，影响训练效率。

Method: 引入LoopTool框架，通过贪婪能力探测、判断引导标签验证和错误驱动数据扩展三个模块迭代优化数据和模型。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型超越32B数据生成器，在BFCL - v3和ACEBench基准测试中取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 闭环、自优化的数据管道能显著提升大语言模型的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，但使用传统编码器模型检索，未来计划用更高效文本搜索模型提升性能，缩小与人工评估结果差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在控制生成文本特定属性方面存在挑战，如难以精确进行多属性控制、缺乏冲突协调机制和迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出C$^3$TG两阶段框架，生成阶段选择性配对大语言模型和属性分类器，用加权KL散度调整标记概率；优化阶段用能量函数结合分类器分数和惩罚项，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: C$^3$TG在属性准确性、语言流畅性、输出多样性等多个指标上显著优于基线，同时降低了毒性。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG是一种有效且灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案，无需昂贵的模型修改。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Motivation: 商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上有一定表现，但开放科学社区未取得可比成果，因此要为巴斯克语这一低资源语言开发强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 开发训练和评估的图像 - 文本数据集，使用Llama - 3.1 - Instruct模型和巴斯克语适配变体Latxa作为骨干，探索不同数据混合进行训练。

Result: 低比例（约20%）的巴斯克语多模态数据就能在巴斯克语基准测试中获得可靠结果；无需巴斯克语指令骨干大语言模型也能得到强大的巴斯克语多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发其他低资源语言的多模态大语言模型提供了方向，并通过开源资源推动相关研究。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中位数基数比现有认证方法最多提高30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法和扩展的理论框架能有效解决序列分类针对编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

Conclusion: TPoT策略有效，可用于预测Big Five人格特质等，还能解决大语言模型输入文本限制问题。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.
