Given queries and certain index-related\nconstraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or\nlearning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query\nperformance.

This model poses significant challenges for constructing\nlong paths. Many known algorithms tasked with extending an existing path as a\nsubroutine require an entire pass to add a single additional edge. This raises\na fundamental question: Are multiple passes inherently necessary to construct\npaths of non-trivial lengths, or can a single pass suffice? To address this\nquestion, we study the Longest Path problem in the one-pass streaming model. In\nthis problem, given a desired approximation factor $\\alpha$, the objective is\nto compute a path of length at least $\\lp(G) / \\alpha$, where $\\lp(G)$ is the\nlength of a longest path in the input graph. We give algorithms as well as\nspace lower bounds for both undirected and directed graphs. Our results\ninclude: We show that for undirected graphs, in both the insertion-only and the\ninsertion-deletion models, there are semi-streaming algorithms, that compute a\npath of length at least $d /3$ with high probability, where $d$ is the average\ndegree of the graph. These algorithms can also yield an $\\alpha$-approximation\nto Longest Path using space $\\tilde{O}(n^2 / \\alpha)$. Next, we show that such\na result cannot be achieved for directed graphs, even in the insertion-only\nmodel. We show that computing a $(n^{1 - o(1)})$-approximation to Longest Path\nin directed graphs in the insertion-only model requires space $\\Omega(n^2)$. We\nfurther show two additional lower bounds. First, we show that semi-streaming\nspace is insufficient for small constant factor approximations to Longest Path\nfor undirected graphs in the insertion-only model. Last, in undirected graphs\nin the insertion-deletion model, we show that computing an\n$\\alpha$-approximation requires space $\\Omega(n^2 / \\alpha^3)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u904d\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6700\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65e0\u5411\u548c\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u957f\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u5426\u9700\u591a\u904d\u5904\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u904d\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6700\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u5411\u548c\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u63a8\u5bfc\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u5411\u56fe\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u63d2\u5165 - \u5220\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u534a\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6700\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates.

Groenen", "Michael Greenacre"], "title": "Interpretable Kernels", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine\nlearning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in\nkernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.\nFirst, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each\nobservation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty\nterm is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature\nspace. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the\nexact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of\nthe features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted.

This is partly\nbecause conventional phenomenological yield criteria struggle to combine a\nhighly descriptive, flexible representation with constraints, such as\nconvexity, dictated by thermodynamic consistency. To address this gap, we\nemploy architecturally-constrained neural networks and develop two data-driven\nframeworks: (i) a hybrid model that augments the Hill yield criterion with an\nInput Convex Neural Network (ICNN) to get an anisotropic yield function\nrepresentation in the six-dimensional stress space and (ii) a\npermutation-invariant input convex neural network (PI-ICNN) that learns an\nisotropic yield function representation in the principal stress space and\nembeds anisotropy through linear stress transformations. We calibrate the\nproposed frameworks on a sparse Al-7079 extrusion experimental dataset\ncomprising 12 uniaxial samples with measured yield stresses and Lankford\nratios. To test the robustness of each framework, nine datasets were generated\nusing k-fold cross-validation. These datasets were then used to quantitatively\ncompare Hill-48, Yld2004-18p, pure ICNNs, the hybrid approach, and the PI-ICNN\nframeworks. While ICNNs and hybrid approaches can almost perfectly fit the\ntraining data, they exhibit significant over-fitting, resulting in high\nvalidation and test losses. In contrast, both PI-ICNN frameworks demonstrate\nbetter generalization capabilities, even outperforming Yld2004-18p on the\nvalidation and test data. These results demonstrate that PI-ICNNs unify\nphysics-based constraints with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling the\naccurate prediction of both yield loci and Lankford ratios from minimal data.\nThe approach opens a path toward rapid, thermodynamically consistent\nconstitutive models for advanced forming simulations and future exploration of\ncoupled hardening or microstructure-informed design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u91d1\u5c5e\u5851\u6027\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0cPI - ICNN \u6846\u67b6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u5c48\u670d\u51c6\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91d1\u5c5e\u5851\u6027\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c PI - ICNN \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728 Al - 7079 \u6324\u538b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u7528 k \u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "ICNN \u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0cPI - ICNN \u6846\u67b6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e Yld2004 - 18p\u3002", "conclusion": "PI - ICNN \u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u6700\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency.

Unlike\ntraditional GPU workloads, LLM inference has two stages with different\ncharacteristics: the prefill phase, which is latency sensitive and scales\nquadratically with prompt length, and the decode phase, which progresses token\nby token with unpredictable length. Current GPU power governors (for example,\nNVIDIA's default) overlook this asymmetry and treat both stages uniformly. The\nresult is mismatched voltage and frequency settings, head-of-line blocking, and\nexcessive energy use.\n  We introduce GreenLLM, an SLO-aware serving framework that minimizes GPU\nenergy by explicitly separating prefill and decode control. At ingress,\nrequests are routed into length-based queues so short prompts avoid\nhead-of-line blocking and TTFT improves. For prefill, GreenLLM collects short\ntraces on a GPU node, fits compact latency-power models over SM frequency, and\nsolves a queueing-aware optimization to select energy-minimal clocks per class.\nDuring decode, a lightweight dual-loop controller tracks throughput (tokens per\nsecond) and adjusts frequency with hysteretic, fine-grained steps to hold tail\nTBT within target bounds.

Using a multi-period\ndifference-in-differences (DID) approach, supported by event study and\npropensity score matching, we quantify the heterogeneous impacts of HSR\nopenings across administrative types and regions, with special attention to the\npresence of direct HSR station access. The results show that HSR expansion\nsignificantly increases secondary and tertiary sector output in urban districts\n(by 2.77 and 8.71 hundred million RMB) and in county-level cities, particularly\nin the eastern region. In contrast, counties without HSR stations or with\nweaker economic foundations experience much smaller gains.

The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation\nscale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time\nfor stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks.

Leveraging the low-power, long-range capabilities of the LoRa\n(Long Range) protocol alongside Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies, the\nresearch addresses challenges such as limited bandwidth, data collisions, and\nnode failures. Given that LoRa's packet-based system is incompatible with\nconventional IaC tools like Ansible and Terraform, which rely on TCP/IP\nnetworking, the research adapts IaC principles within a containerised\narchitecture deployed across a Raspberry Pi cluster. Evaluation experiments\nindicate that fragmenting data packets and retransmitting any missed fragments\ncan mitigate LoRa's inherent throughput and packet size limitations, although\nissues such as collisions and line-of-sight interference persist.

In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in\nTPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger\nrepresentational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained\nusing MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient\ntensor-parallel decoding without retraining.

A stack (resp. queue) layout places vertices\nalong a line and assigns edges to pages so that no two edges on the same page\nare crossing (resp. nested). We provide three new algorithms which together\nsubstantially expand our understanding of these problems:\n  (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm for computing minimum-page stack and queue\nlayouts w.r.t. the vertex integrity of an n-vertex graph G. This result is\nmotivated by an open question in the literature and generalizes the previous\nalgorithms parameterizing by the vertex cover number of G. The proof relies on\na newly developed Ramsey pruning technique. Vertex integrity intuitively\nmeasures the vertex deletion distance to a subgraph with only small connected\ncomponents.\n  (2) An n^(O(q * l)) algorithm for computing l-page stack and queue layouts of\npage width at most q. This is the first algorithm avoiding a double-exponential\ndependency on the parameters. The page width of a layout measures the maximum\nnumber of edges one needs to cross on any page to reach the outer face.\n  (3) A 2^(O(n)) algorithm for computing 1-page queue layouts.

Task and actor\nmodels are common choices that offer different trade-offs between development\nproductivity and achieved performance. Task-based models offer better\nproductivity and composition of software, whereas actor-based models routinely\ndeliver better peak performance due to lower overheads. While task-based and\nactor-based models appear to be different superficially, we demonstrate these\nprogramming models are duals of each other.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities.

Many attempts employ supervised or\nreinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.\nHowever, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not\ncompetitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization\nbetween metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the\nlatent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For\nsuch, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a\nhierarchical graph visualization problem.

In line with this, this paper\ninvestigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of\nGRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational\nexperiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node\nembedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The\nevaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of\nthe solutions according to the required time for such. According to this\nmeasure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem.

Further experimentation\nresults, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance\naccuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle\ndynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on\nspecifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive\nsimulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic\nmachine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to\ntemperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.\nThe real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2\n%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of\nThings devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time\ninsights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,\nensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u79cd\u76d1\u6d4b\u8f6e\u7f18\u78e8\u635f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u8f66\u8f7d\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cIIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u969c\u94c1\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u94c1\u8def\u8f6e\u8f68\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u8f66\u8f7d\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u62df\u8f6e\u7f18\u78e8\u635f\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1IIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u964d\u566a\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6e29\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe96.5%\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\uff0cIIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u964d\u566a\u4f7f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f398.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5148\u8fdb\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f6e\u7f18\u78e8\u635f\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u72b6\u51b5\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u94c1\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we\npropose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to\nenhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first\nwork to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,\nenabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures.

Specifically, we present the\ngroup theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric\nspaces $\\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its\nnormal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the\ngenus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient\nautomorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of\nthe Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces\n$\\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in\nterms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to\nobtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza\nRiemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the\nAbel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel\nTheta function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ee7\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55Cartan\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u7cfb\u5217\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u591a\u6837\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3aCartan\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9879\u76ee\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Tits Satake\u5411\u91cf\u675f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u5173\u4e8e\u57fa\u6d41\u5f62\u5e73\u94fa\u3001\u675f\u622a\u9762\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u7d27\u5bf9\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u9694\u5668\u7684\u7fa4\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5546\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u70ed\u6838\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u731c\u60f3\u4f9d\u9760\u9ece\u66fc\u66f2\u9762\u7684Abel - Jacobi\u6620\u5c04\u548cSiegel Theta\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efaBolza\u9ece\u66fc\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has\nextensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been\ngiven to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution\nof ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses\nthis gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking\nframework for managing software engineering practices, with large language\nmodels (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist\nstudents and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot\nemploys a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant\ncontextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were\nused to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base\nmodel and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated\nthrough both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated\nresponses.

Towards this end, we construct\na large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and\ntrain a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our\napproach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing\npaired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and\nnatural language correction.

We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector\ngenerated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative\ngradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate.

Our\nempirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,\ndemonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory\nin both norm and direction.

This work examines how\npersuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed\noutputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion.

Existing\nextraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,\ninterruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated\nvalidation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field\nvalues across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to\ntransform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances\ncontaining typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each\nsynthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can\nrecover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer\nto automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic\ntranscripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering.

However, these tasks\ninherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,\nnecessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we\npropose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content\nquality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our\nevaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of\ncited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements\nwithin the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published\nsurvey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we\napply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and\nestablish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an\nagent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes\ngenerated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the\nfaithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating\nnon-cited claims using web-based resources.

However, these KCs can be incomplete,\nerror-prone, or overly general.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary\nrepresentations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence\nof a latent concept.

The goal\nof prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high\ngeneration quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,\nface challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like\nmissing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token\nremoval. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method\ncenters at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method\nsplits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be\nmore concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We\ndesign several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized\nsemantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,\ncompression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques\neffectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and\ncoherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the\ncompression ratio.

While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision.

We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to\ndisability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone\ndoes not mitigate stereotype amplification.\n  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other\ndemographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment\nstrategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage\ndisability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention\ncalibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic\ninference.

BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in\ndistinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality\nexamples of harmful actions.

Using\nthis benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an\nattacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate\nother agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the\nattack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial\nagent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This\nattack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense\nstrategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on\nmessage monitoring.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

To enhance the reasoning\nperformance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning\napproaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability\nof LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their\neffectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,\nvanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nincorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model\ncollapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,\nexisting SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially\nleading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of\npotential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated\nCoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \\TheName{}, to enhance the\nreasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.\nSpecifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this\nrepresentation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning\nprocess. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but\nalso stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional\nunsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth\nanalysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two\ndatasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \\TheName{} in terms of\nrobustness, performance (up to 10.15\\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\\%).

Furthermore, the agent\nmaintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on\ndifferent video sequences (including a blank video).

Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are\ninadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,\nunderscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this\nlimitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that\nleverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including\nstatistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,\nRandom Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of\ncryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate\nprobabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on\npredictions derived from multiple base models.

In this paper, we propose\nCycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction\ntuning.

To achieve this,\nit performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative\ntokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while\nStage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.\nExtensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\\times$\ndecoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\\times$ speedup for\nQwen2.5-VL-32B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8eVid - LLMs\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6SpecVLM\uff0c\u80fd\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Vid - LLMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u671f\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpecVLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u6839\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u5747\u5300\u4fee\u526a\u5269\u4f59\u5197\u4f59\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "SpecVLM\u53ef\u4fee\u526a\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLLaVA - OneVision - 72B\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.68\u500d\uff0cQwen2.5 - VL - 32B\u63d0\u53472.11\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecVLM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u635f\u5730\u52a0\u901fVid - LLMs\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Vevo2, a\nunified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To\ntackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable\nflexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a\nmusic-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from\nspeech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5\nHz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style\nfor both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2\nconsists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to\nenable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a\nflow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.\nParticularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and\nimplicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.\nMoreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,\nwe design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both\nintelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show\nthat the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and\nsinging voice generation.

Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide\nessential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as\ninsufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme\nevents. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal\ndownscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned\nClimate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation\ncapabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain\nadaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global\nlow-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate\ninformation while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal\nscales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our\nmodel outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme\nprecipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing\nerrors and improving the ability to capture extreme events.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition.

To facilitate a rigorous OOD\nevaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.\nExperiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and\npersonalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D\nconsistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while\nmaintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMV - RAG\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u57df\u5916\u6216\u7f55\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u57df\u5916\u6216\u7f55\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMV - RAG\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5148\u4ece2D\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u6837\u53162D\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57df\u5916\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57df\u5916/\u7f55\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u76843D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8d34\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MV - RAG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u57df\u5916\u6216\u7f55\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
