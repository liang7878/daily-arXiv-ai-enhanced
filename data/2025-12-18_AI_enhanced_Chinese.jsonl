A common task in this context is subsequence search, which involves identifying all MTS that contain subsequences highly similar to a query time series. In practical scenarios, not all channels of an MTS are relevant to every query. For instance, airplane sensors may gather data on a plethora of components and subsystems, but only a few of these are relevant to a specific query, such as identifying the cause of a malfunctioning landing gear, or a specific flight maneuver. Consequently, the relevant query channels are often specified at query time. In this work, we introduce the Multivariate Subsequence Index (MS-Index), a novel algorithm for nearest neighbor MTS subsequence search under Euclidean distance that supports ad-hoc selection of query channels. The algorithm is exact and demonstrates query performance that scales sublinearly to the number of query channels.

Researchers often need to search for datasets based on high-level task descriptions. However, existing search systems struggle with this task due to ambiguous user intent, task-to-dataset mapping and benchmark gaps, and entity ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce KATS, a novel end-to-end system for task-oriented dataset search from unstructured scientific literature. KATS consists of two key components, i.e., offline knowledge base construction and online query processing. The sophisticated offline pipeline automatically constructs a high-quality, dynamically updatable task-dataset knowledge graph by employing a collaborative multi-agent framework for information extraction, thereby filling the task-to-dataset mapping gap. To further address the challenge of entity ambiguity, a unique semantic-based mechanism is used for task entity linking and dataset entity resolution. For online retrieval, KATS utilizes a specialized hybrid query engine that combines vector search with graph-based ranking to generate highly relevant results. Additionally, we introduce CS-TDS, a tailored benchmark suite for evaluating task-oriented dataset search systems, addressing the critical gap in standardized evaluation.

This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems.

Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faJEANet\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8054\u5408\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u6295\u6807\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AMD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7JEANet\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5360\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "JEANet\u5728\u591a\u63d2\u69fd\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "JEANet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u878d\u5165\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u7684AMD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u6295\u6807\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u7edf\u4e00\u62cd\u5356\u3002"}}

We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster.

However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures.

However, the performance of DRL agents has high variability and it is very sensible to the value of their hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods that are suited to the optimization of black-box functions, that is, functions whose analytical expression is unknown, are noisy and expensive to evaluate. The hyperparameter tuning problem of DRL algorithms perfectly suits this scenario. As training an agent just for one objective is a very expensive period, requiring millions of timesteps, instead of optimizing an objective being a mixture of a risk-performance metric and an ESG metric, we choose to separate the objective and solve the multi-objective scenario to obtain an optimal Pareto set of portfolios representing the best tradeoff between the Sharpe ratio and the ESG mean score of the portfolio and leaving to the investor the choice of the final portfolio. We conducted our experiments using environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym, adapted from the FinRL platform.

At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset.

Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4.

We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them.

This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification.

Latent Class Regression (LCR) models offer a principled approach to identify subgroups with shared sleep behaviour profiles whilst incorporating predictors of group membership, but Bayesian inference for these models has been hindered by computational challenges and the absence of variable selection methods. We propose a fully Bayesian framework for LCR that uses P\u00f3lya-Gamma data augmentation, enabling efficient sampling of regression coefficients. We extend this framework to include variable selection for both predictors and item responses: predictor variable selection via latent inclusion indicators and item selection through a partially collapsed approach. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods yield accurate parameter estimates, resolve identifiability issues arising in full models and successfully identify informative predictors and items while excluding noise variables. Applying this methodology to CSHQ data from 148 children reveals distinct latent subgroups with different sleep behaviour profiles, anxious nighttime sleepers, short/light sleepers and those with more pervasive sleep problems, with each carrying distinct implications for intervention. Results also highlight the predictive role of Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis in subgroup membership.

This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the \"Something Completely Different\" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u63a2\u7d22\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u77ed\u671f\u4e1a\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7535\u89c6\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6eda\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201cSomething Completely Different\u201d\u884c\uff0c\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdbA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u65e0\u504f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5c06\u65e0\u504f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5019\u9009\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c55\u793a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u504f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent).

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4f55\u65f6\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u59d4\u6258\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u9700\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u59d4\u6258\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9aAI\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u732e\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f55\u65f6\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\uff08\u4e0d\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u9700\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u59d4\u6258\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u4e8b\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u786e\u5b9aAI\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u5411\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u56de\u62a5\u3002"}}

We seek a path $P$ starting at $s$ and visiting all the clients so as to minimize the sum of client waiting times (also known as latency) before being visited on the path.\n  In contrast to the symmetric version of this problem (also known as the Deliveryperson problem and the Repairperson problem in the literature), there are significant gaps in our understanding of Directed Latency. The best approximation factor has remained at $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of clients, for more than a decade [Friggstad, Salavatipour, and Svitkina, '13]. Only recently, [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] presented a constant-factor approximation but in quasi-polynomial time. Both results follow similar ideas: they consider buckets with geometrically-increasing distances, build paths in each bucket, and then stitch together all these paths to get a feasible solution. [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] showed if we guess a vertex from each bucket and augment a standard LP relaxation with these guesses, then one can reduce the stitching cost. Unfortunately, there are logarithmically many buckets so the running time of their algorithm is quasi-polynomial.\n  In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation for Directed Latency in polynomial time by introducing a completely new way of bucketing which helps us strengthen a standard LP relaxation with less aggressive guessing. Although the resulting LP is no longer a relaxation of Directed Latency, it still admits a good solution. We present a rounding algorithm for fractional solutions of our LP, crucially exploiting the way we restricted the feasibility region of the LP formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling.

However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \\underline{\\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \\underline{\\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction.

We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution.

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup.

Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds.

These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model.

Nonetheless, accurate long-term forecasts are essential for high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and traders. The proposed improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model is specifically designed for long-term price prediction of global indices. The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIGA - SVR\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6307\u6570\u957f\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6bd4LSTM\u548cOGA - SVR\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7b49\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIGA - SVR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009SVR\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u6307\u6570\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0eLSTM\u548cOGA - SVR\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "IGA - SVR\u6bd4LSTM\u7684MAPE\u964d\u4f4e19.87%\uff0c\u6bd4OGA - SVR\u964d\u4f4e50.03%\uff0cLSTM\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e3aIGA - SVR\u768420\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "IGA - SVR\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6307\u6570\u957f\u671f\u65e5\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC).

These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u504f\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\uff08PLS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1PLS\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u91caPLS - SVD\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u6216\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5171\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4PLS - SVD\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u79df\u7ea6\u7b97\u6cd5LeaseGuard\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8eRaft\u9009\u4e3e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bfb\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5199\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8bfb\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Raft\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bfb\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79df\u7ea6\u534f\u8bae\u6307\u5b9a\u6a21\u7cca\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56Raft\u9009\u4e3e\u7279\u6027\u7684LeaseGuard\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528TLA+\u4e25\u683c\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Python\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5728LogCabin\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bfb\u5f00\u9500\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u7f51\u7edc\u5f80\u8fd4\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u96f6\uff0c\u5199\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4ece\u6bcf\u79d2\u7ea61000\u6b21\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u7ea610000\u6b21\uff0c\u65b0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u80fd\u8ba999%\u7684\u8bfb\u7acb\u5373\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "LeaseGuard\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQ - MetaSur\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5904\u7406\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u590d\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQ - MetaSur\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728CEC2019\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQ - MetaSur\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Q - MetaSur\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf96G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u901a\u9053\u77e5\u8bc6\u5730\u56fe\uff08CKM\uff09\u66f4\u65b0\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5730\u56fe\u6548\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760CKM\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9884\u5efaCKM\u4f1a\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u5b58\u5728CKM\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5730\u56fe\u6548\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\uff08MEF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eDinkelbach\u7684Delta - P\u548cDelta - L\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u5206\u522b\u5236\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Delta - P\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0cDelta - L\u6709\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8fdb\u5165\u635f\u5931\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u5229\u4e8e\u7acb\u5373\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u8fdb\u5165\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u5229\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments.

We varied recommendations to follow SMCs producing predominantly-political (PP), predominantly-apolitical (PA), or entirely non-political (NP) content, and cross-randomized financial incentives to follow assigned SMCs. Beyond markedly increasing consumption of assigned SMCs' content, biweekly quiz-based incentives increased overall social media use by 10% and made participants more politically knowledgeable. These incentives to follow PP or PA SMCs led participants to adopt more liberal policy positions and grand narratives around election time, while PP SMCs more strongly shaped partisan evaluations and vote choice. PA SMCs were seen as more informative and trustworthy, generating larger effects per video concerning politics. Participants assigned to follow NP SMCs instead became more conservative, consistent with left-leaning participants using social media more when right-leaning content was ascendant. These effects exceed the impacts of traditional campaign outreach and partisan media, demonstrating the importance of SMCs as opinion leaders in the attention economy as well as trust- and volume-based mechanisms of political persuasion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\uff08SMC\uff09\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd18 - 45\u5c81\u4eba\u7fa4\u653f\u6cbb\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5bb9SMC\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u6cbb\u51b7\u6f20\u548c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u5a01\u7684\u6000\u7591\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u653f\u6cbb\u6001\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "2024\u5e748 - 12\u6708\u9f13\u52b1\u7f8e\u56fd18 - 45\u5c81\u4eba\u7fa4\u5173\u6ce85\u4e2a\u8fdb\u6b65\u6d3eSMC\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u522b\uff08PP\u3001PA\u3001NP\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u5173\u6ce8\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6307\u5b9aSMC\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5bb9SMC\u4f7f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5f71\u54cd\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u5ba3\u4f20\u548c\u515a\u6d3e\u5a92\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SMC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u9886\u8896\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u8bf4\u670d\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662fAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5305\u62ecGPT - 5.1\u7b49\u516d\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u7ea63000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u50cfGPT - 5.1\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u51e0\u4f55\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff0cClaude Sonnet 4.5\u548cKimi K2 Turbo\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53cc\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0cGemini 2.5 Flash\u5728\u975e\u6cd5\u72b6\u6001\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u9762\u9886\u5148\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662fAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6b63\u4ea4\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality.

To address this gap, we present an agent-based computational model (ABM) that integrates tumour metabolism and mechanics to study 3D cancer spheroid growth. Our approach unifies the metabolism and mechanical aspects of tumour development within an integral model for cancer spheroid formation and growth. In addition to that, we performed a computational calibration of the parameters and tested the model versatility to reproduce different cellular behaviours. Our model reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results of spheroid growth obtained in the lab and also allowed to discern different dynamics that cancer cells can present under the same conditions, providing insight into the potential factors contributing to the variability in the size of spheroids. Furthermore, it also showed its adaptability to reproduce diferent cell lines and behaviours by tuning its parameters. This study highlights the significant potential and versatility of integrative modelling approaches in the field of cancer research, not only as a tool to complement in vitro studies, but also as independent tools to derive conclusions from the physical reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u5408\u80bf\u7624\u4ee3\u8c22\u4e0e\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a763D\u764c\u75c7\u7403\u4f53\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u764c\u75c7\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u4ee5\u57fa\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u673a\u5236\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u80bf\u7624\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7403\u4f53\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec6\u80de\u7cfb\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u4f53\u5916\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios.

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5168\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bLADY\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLADY\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ee5\u6052\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u878d\u5408\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728NAVSIM\u548cBench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "LADY\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08VFL\uff09\u7684Shapley - CMI\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165PSI\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7eb5\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u65b9\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u539fShapley - CMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\uff08PSI\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5217\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5404\u65b9\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u8ba1\u7b97Shapley - CMI\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u591a\u65b9\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u3002"}}

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement.

This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points.

We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6Fusion - 3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u805a\u7c7bUCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0cF3\u5728UCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4Rocket\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c0f\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Rocket\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Fusion - 3\u6846\u67b6\u878d\u5408Rocket\u3001Sax\u548cSfa\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u7528\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u5c06UCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548cSHAP\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "F3\u5728\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6216\u4e30\u5bcc\u9891\u7387\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728UCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4Rocket\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c0f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u878d\u5408\u662f\u5bf9\u5f3a\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4fee\u6b63\u5176\u5f31\u70b9\u3002"}}

This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments.

This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought.

However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \\textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part.

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u52a0\u6743\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u867d\u80fd\u6536\u7d27\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u91cf\u96c6\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCluster - to - Cluster\u548cPick - and - Sort\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u52a0\u6743\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u957f\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8bbe\u7f6e\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability.

Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faClass - Aware Attribution Prior (CAP)\u53caCAP Hybrid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bcc\u96c6\u5f52\u56e0\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u56e0\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5224\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAP\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CAP Hybrid\u7ec4\u5408CAP\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5f62\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRE2 - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u542b1101\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684RE2 - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7528RE2 - Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5148\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u5e45\u9ad8\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate.

Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties.

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.", "AI": {"tldr": "DL\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u73b0bug\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRepGen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728106\u4e2abug\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5b83\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u73b0\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "DL\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591abug\u3001\u6545\u969c\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9bbug\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u800c\u6781\u5176\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRepGen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u5168\u9762\u7684bug\u91cd\u73b0\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210 - \u9a8c\u8bc1 - \u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u73b0bug\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728106\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684DL bug\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680.19%\u7684\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8619.81%\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cRepGen\u4f7fDL bug\u91cd\u73b0\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad823.35%\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1156.8%\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "RepGen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u667a\u80fd\u7684DL bug\u91cd\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347bug\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia.

Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.\n  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797.

Quantifying uncertainty in spatial boundary locations and formally testing for temporal shifts remains challenging, especially when boundaries are derived from noisy, gridded environmental data. We present a unified framework that combines heteroskedastic Gaussian process (GP) regression with a scaled Maximum Absolute Difference (MAD) Global Envelope Test (GET) to estimate spatial boundary curves and assess whether they evolve over time. The heteroskedastic GP provides a flexible probabilistic reconstruction of boundary lines, capturing spatially varying mean structure and location specific variability, while the test offers a rigorous hypothesis testing tool for detecting departures from expected boundary behaviors. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves the correct size under the null and high power for detecting local boundary shifts. Applying our framework to the Sahel Sahara transition zone, using annual Koppen Trewartha climate classifications from 1960 to 1989, we find no statistically significant decade scale changes in the arid and semi arid or semi arid and non arid interfaces.

Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities.

The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions.

The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space.

Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum.

We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible.

In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems.

The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types. We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u548c\u635f\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u7075\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CR"], "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5Aletheia\u8bc6\u522bJavaScript\u5305\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u722c\u53d6\u53d1\u73b0\u7f51\u7ad9\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u66f4\u65b0\u80cc\u540e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u590d\u6742\u3002", "motivation": "npm\u4e0b\u8f7d\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f15\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5305\u7248\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u4ee3Web\u5e94\u7528\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5Aletheia\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6284\u88ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7b97\u6cd5\u5256\u6790JavaScript\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5305\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u722c\u53d6\u53d1\u73b05% - 20%\u7684\u57df\u540d\u572816\u5468\u5185\u66f4\u65b0\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u6346\u7ed1\u5305\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4CDN\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5305\u5feb\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u5305\u7248\u672c\u5c11\u8fbe10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u53cd\u6620\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u53ca\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime.

This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance.

Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers.

Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model.

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph.

In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks.

These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.\n  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules.

While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \\citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u201c\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u201d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06Julia\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3aSystemVerilog\uff0c\u80fd\u5728FPGA\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u201d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06Julia\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u5185\u6838\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210SystemVerilog\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210AXI4 - Stream\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9eFPGA\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ee5100MHz\u8fd0\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406/\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u768459.71% - 82.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u8ba9\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u7528Julia\u7f16\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u79fb\u690d\u5230FPGA\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}}

Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications.

A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aFourier Analysis Network (FAN)\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6b63\u5f26\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5176\u6539\u5584\u6e90\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u5728x=0\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1ReLU\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1Dual - Activation Layer (DAL)\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76FAN\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790FAN\u4e2d\u6b63\u5f26\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u4ee3ReLU\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1DAL\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "DAL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9FAN\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ece\u9891\u8c31\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0cDAL\u662f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002"}}

Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u71b5\u5e93Bregman\u6295\u5f71\uff08ERBP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u6307\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u5173\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u71b5\u901a\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u6307\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ed\u73af\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673aBregman\u6295\u5f71\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u5e93\u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u71b5\u901a\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5f97\u51fa\u5d29\u6e83\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u71b5\u4e0b\u9650\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u71b5\u5e93\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "ERBP\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5373\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u71b5\u901a\u91cf\u3002"}}

These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers.

While a range of external evaluations and safety frameworks have emerged, comparatively little attention has been paid to how internal organizational assurance should be structured to provide sustained, evidence-based oversight of catastrophic and systemic risks. This paper examines how an internal audit function could be designed to provide meaningful assurance for frontier AI developers, and the practical trade-offs that shape its effectiveness. Drawing on professional internal auditing standards, risk-based assurance theory, and emerging frontier-AI governance literature, we analyze four core design dimensions: (i) audit scope across model-level, system-level, and governance-level controls; (ii) sourcing arrangements (in-house, co-sourced, and outsourced); (iii) audit frequency and cadence; and (iv) access to sensitive information required for credible assurance. For each dimension, we define the relevant option space, assess benefits and limitations, and identify key organizational and security trade-offs. Our findings suggest that internal audit, if deliberately designed for the frontier AI context, can play a central role in strengthening safety governance, complementing external evaluations, and providing boards and regulators with higher-confidence, system-wide assurance over catastrophic risk controls.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u529f\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ca\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u4e13\u4e1a\u5185\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6cbb\u7406\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u91c7\u8d2d\u5b89\u6392\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u9891\u7387\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd9\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u9009\u9879\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbfAI\u60c5\u5883\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u8865\u5145\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4e3a\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels.

The manuscript has been accepted for publication at SANER 2026!", "summary": "Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSEBERTIS\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3DNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728GitHub\u95ee\u9898\u62a5\u544a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u4ea4\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u671f\u671b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEBERTIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u53cc\u5411Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SEBERTIS\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u572810000\u4efdGitHub\u95ee\u9898\u62a5\u544a\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.9880\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u57fa\u4e8eML\u548cLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SEBERTIS\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified.

However, some users, especially members of minority groups, may be less likely to receive information spreading on the network, due to their disadvantaged network position. We study the optimization problem of adding new connections to a network to enhance fairness in information access among different demographic groups.\n  We provide a concrete formulation of this problem where information access is measured in terms of resistance distance, {offering a new perspective that emphasizes global network structure and multi-path connectivity.} The problem is shown to be NP-hard. We propose a simple greedy algorithm which turns out to output accurate solutions, but its run time is cubic, which makes it undesirable for large networks. As our main technical contribution, we reduce its time complexity to linear, leveraging several novel approximation techniques. In addition to our theoretical findings, we also conduct an extensive set of experiments using both real-world and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that our linear-time algorithm can produce accurate solutions for networks with millions of nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u8fde\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u6237\u56e0\u7f51\u7edc\u4f4d\u7f6e\u52a3\u52bf\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u7535\u963b\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u7acb\u65b9\u964d\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs.

Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u53d7\u5f15\u5bfc\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u4ecd\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6216\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ea6\u675f\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d7\u5f15\u5bfc\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5bf9\u7b26\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6709\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5229\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u504f\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e5f\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily.

Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives.

Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u5426\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u4f5c\u7528\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u591a\u5f15\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d29\u6e83\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u524d\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u5426\u7f13\u89e3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5341\u6b21\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u592a\u5c11\u6216\u592a\u591a\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728AI\u5355\u4e00\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u76d1\u6d4bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u9f13\u52b1\u66f4\u591a\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs.

While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions.

Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized.

Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio.

The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.\n  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead.

However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy.

However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness.

To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes.

Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation.

We baseline and red team Factor($U$,$T$) in control evaluations on BigCodeBench, a dataset of Python coding tasks. Monitors distinguishing malicious from honest decompositions perform poorly (AUROC 0.52) compared to monitors evaluating complete Python solutions (AUROC 0.96).

FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process.

Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction.

Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions.

We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6TrajSyn\uff0c\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TrajSyn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "TrajSyn\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSyn\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u5668\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b64\u7acb\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5e38\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u6062\u590d\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u7eb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5173\u7cfb\uff1bSAE\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u64cd\u7eb5\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u91cf\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u5728\u64cd\u7eb5\u65f6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u786e\u7acb\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).\n  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.\n  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems.

Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4ea4\u6362\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u7528\u5f71\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u68af\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u534a\u8bda\u5b9e\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5bf9\u624b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8f6e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6613\u53d7\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5a01\u80c1\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u8d28\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning.

Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x.

Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5Chorus\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u5934\u5e73\u8861\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMU\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u548cWiFi\u4f20\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cChorus\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u9ad8\u51fa11.3%\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u673a\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "Chorus\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows.

The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning.

Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity.

On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.\n  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence.

By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute.\n  An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface.\n  We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728Nightjar\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u7a0b\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u91cf\u5c11\u4f46\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Python\uff09\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u81ea\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53e3\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Nightjar\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Nightjar\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08+4 - 19%\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1139.6%\u4ee3\u7801\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\uff080.4 - 4.3\u500d\u624b\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cNightjar\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off.

Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.\n  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d1\u7535\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8003\u8651\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7535\u78c1\u6682\u6001\uff08EMT\uff09\u4eff\u771f\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u77ac\u65f6\u4e2d\u65ad\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6545\u969c\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u8f83\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u76f8\u4e22\u5931\u65f6\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea613%\uff1b\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6574\u4f53\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7535\u538b\u4e22\u5931\u4f7f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u52a0\u8d85150%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel \"hallucinated compliance\" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment.

Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long \"distribution rollout\" (DR) and a short \"training rollout\" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89c6\u754c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5DHMBPO\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6eda\u52a8\u957f\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u89c6\u754c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDHMBPO\uff0c\u5c06\u6eda\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u957f\u7684\u201c\u5206\u5e03\u6eda\u52a8\u201d\uff08DR\uff09\u548c\u77ed\u7684\u201c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6eda\u52a8\u201d\uff08TR\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u89c6\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709MBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DHMBPO\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6eda\u52a8\u957f\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives.

Optimally balancing acquisition time, computational capacity, and photobleaching budgets across thousands of dynamically evolving regions of interest remains an open challenge, further complicated by limited field-of-view adjustments and sensor sensitivity. Existing approaches either rely on static sampling or heuristics that neglect the dynamic evolution of biological processes, leading to inefficiencies and missed events. Here, we introduce the restless multi-process multi-armed bandit (RMPMAB), a new decision-theoretic framework in which each experimental region is modeled not as a single process but as an ensemble of Markov chains, thereby capturing the inherent heterogeneity of biological systems such as asynchronous cell cycles and heterogeneous drug responses. Building upon this foundation, we derive closed-form expressions for transient and asymptotic behaviors of aggregated processes, and design scalable Whittle index policies with sub-linear complexity in the number of imaging regions. Through both simulations and a real biological live-cell imaging dataset, we show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in throughput under resource constraints. Notably, our algorithm outperforms Thomson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, epsilon-Greedy, and Round Robin by reducing cumulative regret by more than 37% in simulations and capturing 93% more biologically relevant events in live imaging experiments, underscoring its potential for transformative smart microscopy.

Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: \"Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?\" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility.

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aBraTS 2025\u5206\u5272\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u4ee5\u5357\u975e\u6d32\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534714.9%\uff0c\u6210\u4eba\u795e\u7ecf\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u53470.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u52a8\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u5411\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u914d\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7075\u6d3b\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9700\u7b80\u5316\u624d\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7075\u6d3b\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u505a\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u8003\u8651\u4ee3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u548c\u4ec5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6700\u7ec8\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4ee3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u5728\u627e\u5230\u4f18\u8d28\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3SDL\u987a\u5229\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation.

With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.\n  We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfEVICPRESS\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6dd8\u6c70\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u7ba1\u7406KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u672a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u6dd8\u6c70\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u751f\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u6dd8\u6c70\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\u66f4\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cEVICPRESS\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c5\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cEVICPRESS\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u9996\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u5feb2.19\u500d\u3002"}}

For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics.

However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances.

However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance.

Camera-ready for WACV 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7be1\u6539\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u4e00\u534a\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u540e\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions.

Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models.

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential.

Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments.

The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall \"health\" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks.

Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods.

Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHERO\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa3D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u969c\u788d\u7269\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHERO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5176\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5173\u7cfb\u5c42\u6b21\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHERO\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u963b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7fPL\u964d\u4f4e35.1%\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53d7\u963b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7fSR\u63d0\u9ad879.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "HERO\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b8b\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5RAG\u670d\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ABAC\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9RAG\u670d\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7528Laplace\u89c4\u5219\u4f30\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u635f\u5931\u4e09\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u603b\u9884\u671f\u635f\u593131.3\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff1bABAC\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u603b\u9884\u671f\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e94%\uff0cRoC\u4e3a9.83\uff1bNER\u6d88\u9664PII\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0cRoC\u4e3a5.97\uff1bNeMo Guardrails\u6548\u76ca\u5fae\u5f31\uff0cRoC\u4e3a0.05\u3002", "conclusion": "ABAC\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9632\u62a4\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff1bNER\u4e5f\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff1bNeMo Guardrails\u6548\u76ca\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots.

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9SAGIN\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u5207\u6362\u9891\u7387\u548cQoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u786e\u4fdd\u4e09\u7ef4\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3SAGIN\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06UAV\u79fb\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53HDRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9876\u5c42\u7528DDQN\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e95\u5c42\u7528CSAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u5207\u6362\u9891\u7387\u548cQoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53HDRL\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SAGIN\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these models on synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, leaving realistic multi-turn conversational ability underexplored. We introduce Audio MultiChallenge, an open-source benchmark to evaluate E2E spoken dialogue systems under natural multi-turn interaction patterns. Building on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, which evaluates Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, and Self Coherence, we introduce a new axis Voice Editing that tests robustness to mid-utterance speech repairs and backtracking. We further augment each axis to the audio modality, such as introducing Audio-Cue challenges for Inference Memory that require recalling ambient sounds and paralinguistic signals beyond semantic content. We curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics through a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline that exposes model failures at scale while preserving natural disfluencies found in unscripted human speech. Our evaluation of proprietary and open-source models reveals that even frontier models struggle on our benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking), our highest-performing model achieving a 54.65% pass rate. Error analysis shows that models fail most often on our new axes and that Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context.

Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI.

The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical.

In this context, the Delphi method has become an established way to identify consensus and disagreement on emerging technological issues among experts in the field of futures studies and foresight. The aim of this article is twofold: first, it examines key tensions experts see in the development of AI governance in Europe, and second, it reflects on the Delphi method's capacity to inform anticipatory governance of emerging technologies like AI based on these insights. The analysis is based on the results of a two-round Policy Delphi study on the future of AI governance with European policymakers, researchers and NGOs, conducted in mid-2024. The Policy Delphi proved useful in revealing diverse perspectives on European AI governance, drawing out a consensus that future-proof AI regulation will likely depend more on practical implementation and enforcement of legislation than on its technical specifics or scope. Furthermore, the study identified a desirability-probability gap in AI governance: desirable policy directions, like greater citizen participation, were perceived as less probable and feasible. This highlights a tension between desirable regulatory oversight and the practical difficulty for regulation to keep up with technological change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u57fa\u4e8e2024\u5e74\u5e74\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6b27\u6d32\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e24\u8f6e\u653f\u7b56\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u524d\u77bb\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u7d27\u5f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7ed9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u524d\u77bb\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u8f6e\u5173\u4e8e\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cbb\u7406\u672a\u6765\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u62ec\u6b27\u6d32\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "result": "\u653f\u7b56\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\uff1a\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u7ba1\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u800c\u975e\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u6216\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u53d6\u6027 - \u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u8ddf\u4e0a\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u9769\u5b9e\u9645\u56f0\u96be\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa RFKG - CoT \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5176\u6bd4 KG - CoT \u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u9650\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709 KG - CoT \u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u6027\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RFKG - CoT\uff0c\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u521a\u6027\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a KGQA \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRFKG - CoT \u6bd4 KG - CoT \u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 14.7 \u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08Llama2 - 7B \u5728 WebQSP \u4e0a\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8df3\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u793a\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06 KG \u8bc1\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7b54\u6848\u3002"}}

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\u0394$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\u0394$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline).

First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs.

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal.

We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations.

Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted.

Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecdLAIZA\u4eba\u673a\u589e\u5f3a\u5171\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ba1\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728VUCA\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6062\u590d\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6613\u8fc7\u65e9\u89e3\u8bfb\u95ed\u5408\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u5b58\u5728\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAIZA\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u4e13\u5229\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u975e\u574d\u584c\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4eba\u5de5\u6f84\u6e05\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u7559\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u5982\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e13\u5229\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u6d88\u9664\u540e\u53ef\u679c\u65ad\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u751f\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728VUCA\u73af\u5883\u6062\u590d\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated.

Unlike time-invariant effects, training models on devices with internal modulation typically requires the recording or extraction of control signals to ensure the time-alignment required by standard loss functions. This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy.

When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap.

This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \\textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments.

However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC.

However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers.

Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent.

MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS.

However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u70ed\u5931\u63a7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8377\u7535\u72b6\u6001\uff08SOC\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKA - CRNN\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684SOC\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u70ed\u9634\u6781 - \u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5168SOC\u6216\u5c11\u6570\u79bb\u6563SOC\u6c34\u5e73\u63a8\u65ad\u6807\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6ee5\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u653e\u70ed\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8fde\u7eedSOC\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u7269\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u7684KA - CRNN\u4ece\u5dee\u793a\u626b\u63cf\u91cf\u70ed\u6cd5\uff08DSC\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u9634\u6781 - \u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u5206\u89e3\u7684SOC\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u7406\u53cd\u5e94\u9014\u5f84\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eNCA\u3001NM\u548cNMA\u9634\u6781\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u6240\u6709SOC\u4e0bDSC\u653e\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bSOC\u4f9d\u8d56\u6c27\u91ca\u653e\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5c06\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u70ed\u5931\u63a7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity.

For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u6b64\u524d\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7126\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u70b9\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6307\u6807\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u3002", "result": "", "conclusion": "\u867d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques.

A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation.

A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0cVTC\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5f71\u54cdVLMs\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2aVTC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u591a\u6570VLMs\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1VLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9VTC\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cdVLMs\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2aVTC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6eVTC - Retrieval\u3001VTC - Reasoning\u3001VTC - Memory\u4e09\u79cd\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbVTCBench - Wild\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6837\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570VLMs\u867d\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u89e3\u7801\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9VTC\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5173\u8054\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9VTC\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684VLMs\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \\model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8d1f\u62c5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8865\u507f\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u914d\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8 10 \u500d\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8 2 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments. BashArena contains 637 Linux system administration and infrastructure engineering tasks in complex, realistic environments, along with four sabotage objectives (execute malware, exfiltrate secrets, escalate privileges, and disable firewall) for a red team to target. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs on their ability to complete tasks, perform sabotage undetected, and detect sabotage attempts. Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities.
