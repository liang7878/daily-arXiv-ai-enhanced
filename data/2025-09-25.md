### [1] [The Indispensable Role of User Simulation in the Pursuit of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19456)
*Krisztian Balog,ChengXiang Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出用户模拟对AGI发展至关重要，探讨其作用、构建挑战并提出研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AGI发展中评估复杂交互系统和获取训练数据的瓶颈问题。

Method: 阐述用户模拟对AGI的关键作用，探索构建现实模拟器的跨学科性质。

Result: 明确用户模拟对AGI发展的重要性，识别包括大语言模型带来的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 用户模拟技术和智能任务代理的研究需协同推进，以加速AGI发展。

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

### [2] [Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19464)
*Shripad Vilasrao Deshmukh,Will Schwarzer,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出评估感知强化学习（EvA - RL），可在少量滚动数据下准确评估策略，虽存在评估准确性和策略性能的权衡，但扩展方法可减少评估误差并保持竞争力，为新一类强化学习方法奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略评估方法因数据有限、长周期任务、支持不均或环境模型不准确等问题存在高方差或高偏差，标准强化学习范式未明确考虑评估。

Method: 提出EvA - RL，训练策略时同时最大化预期回报和最小化预期评估误差；形式化EvA - RL框架；设计实例；扩展方法联合学习评估条件下的状态值预测器。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明使用固定值预测方案时评估准确性和策略性能存在权衡；在不同离散和连续动作领域的实证结果显示EvA - RL可大幅减少评估误差并保持有竞争力的回报。

Conclusion: EvA - RL为将可靠评估作为训练首要原则的新一类强化学习方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

### [3] [Estimating the Self-Consistency of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19489)
*Robert Nowak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 分析大语言模型自一致性估计器及固定计算预算下的权衡，建议 m,n 与 √B 成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统常重复相同提示以提高大语言模型可靠性，需分析自一致性估计器及权衡。

Method: 在固定计算预算 B = mn 下进行分析，m 为从任务分布采样的提示数，n 为每个提示的重复调用数。

Result: 分析结果倾向于 m,n 与 √B 成比例的大致划分。

Conclusion: 在固定计算预算下，m 和 n 与 √B 成比例的分配方式更优。

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and
aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an
estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a
fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from
the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt;
the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.

### [4] [Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517)
*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究指出大语言模型在静态基准测试和动态信息丰富环境中表现存在差距，引入计算认知负荷理论，设计 ICE 基准测试，发现认知负荷是推理失败的关键因素，强调动态、认知感知压力测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在静态基准测试表现与动态环境中脆弱性的差距问题，理解其在认知负荷下推理的计算限制。

Method: 引入计算认知负荷的形式化理论，设计 ICE 基准测试，对 200 个问题进行 10 次重复研究。

Result: 不同模型表现差异大，小模型基线脆弱，Gemini - 2.0 - Flash - 001 部分有韧性，认知负荷导致推理性能下降。

Conclusion: 动态、认知感知压力测试对评估先进 AI 系统的韧性和安全性至关重要。

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

### [5] [Score the Steps, Not Just the Goal: VLM-Based Subgoal Evaluation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19524)
*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StepEval评估框架，以子目标成功率向量评估策略，推动子目标层面报告成常规做法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人学习论文单一二元成功率报告方式，掩盖策略在多步操作任务中的成败细节，需子目标层面报告。

Method: 提出成本感知的StepEval评估框架，利用视觉语言模型作为子目标结果自动判断器，设计时考虑多种特性。

Result: 提出框架设计原则，考虑多种评估指标用于框架优化诊断。

Conclusion: 提供共享方向，希望子目标评分成标准可复现实践。

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

### [6] [Nano Bio-Agents (NBA): Small Language Model Agents for Genomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19566)
*George Hong,Daniel Trejo Banos*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基因组问答中大型语言模型的幻觉问题和计算成本挑战。

Method: 实现Nano Bio - Agent (NBA)框架，将任务分解、工具编排和API访问融入NCBI和AlphaGenome等系统。

Result: 小语言模型结合代理框架在性能上可与大模型相当甚至更优，最佳组合在GeneTuring基准测试中达98%准确率，3 - 10B参数模型稳定在85 - 97%准确率，且计算资源需求低。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时，有提高效率、节省成本和普及机器学习驱动的基因组工具的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion
parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address
hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

*Nathanael Jo,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章指出基准数据上生成模型评估可靠性存疑，提出评估作为推理的框架，以解决扰动敏感性问题，为可靠评估AI能力奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对生成模型在基准数据上评估的可靠性存疑，需明确评估如何真正反映模型性能。

Method: 提出评估作为推理的原则性框架，从能力理论出发推导估计方法；针对扰动敏感性问题，制定能力模型并引入考虑不确定性的推理方法及自适应算法。

Result: 提出的自适应算法显著降低了样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为通过基准测试对AI能力进行更可靠和可信的估计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

### [8] [SteinerSQL: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning for Text-to-SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19623)
*Xutao Mao,Tao Liu,Hongying Zan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型处理复杂Text - to - SQL查询有困难，本文提出SteinerSQL框架解决问题，在基准测试中取得新的最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型处理复杂Text - to - SQL查询时存在问题，现有方法孤立处理挑战，导致推理过程破碎，影响逻辑和结构正确性。

Method: 引入SteinerSQL框架，将双重挑战统一为以图为中心的优化问题，分数学分解、构建最优推理支架、多级验证三个阶段。

Result: 在LogicCat和Spider2.0 - Lite基准测试中，使用Gemini - 2.5 - Pro分别达到36.10%和40.04%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: SteinerSQL不仅提高了准确率，还为Text - to - SQL提供了新的统一范式，为复杂推理任务提供更强大、有原则的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级测试时间计算策略受模型自我评估能力差的限制，需要提升其有效性。

Method: 提出通过强化学习（GRPO）训练的成对解释验证器，生成校准后的置信分数和相关自然语言推理。

Result: 验证器提高了最佳n选1和自我反思等测试时间策略的准确性和效率，能识别标准方法失败的挑战性失败模式。

Conclusion: 成对解释验证器是提升推理模型测试时间策略效果的有效方法。

Abstract: Advanced test-time computing strategies are essential for scaling reasoning
models, but their effectiveness is capped by the models' poor self-evaluation.
We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning
(GRPO), that produces calibrated confidence scores and associated natural
language reasoning for generated solutions. Our verifier improves the accuracy
and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection.
Crucially, it excels at identifying challenging failure modes, such as when
both candidate solutions are identically incorrect, succeeding where standard
methods like majority voting fail.

TL;DR: 提出UserRL框架训练评估以用户为中心的能力，分析不同奖励公式影响，实验有三项关键发现，强调奖励设计和用户模拟选择重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习训练的代理模型在协助用户时，用户交互的多样性和动态性带来挑战，需提升其以用户为中心的能力。

Method: 提出UserRL框架，通过标准化gym环境和模拟用户进行训练评估，在GRPO算法下系统改变回合级奖励分配和轨迹级分数计算。

Result: 实验发现SFT冷启动对解锁初始交互能力重要；精心设计轨迹评分可实现更高效多轮交互；强大模拟用户利于训练，但开源模拟器具成本效益和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造和用户模拟选择与模型规模同样关键，UserRL是开发稳健以用户为中心代理模型的实用途径，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

TL;DR: 本文针对LCNC环境中自治代理的可靠性挑战，提出集成元认知层的架构模式，实证表明该方法提高任务成功率但增加计算开销，强调人工交接是增强系统韧性等的核心设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LCNC环境中自治代理因非确定性带来的可靠性挑战，如陷入循环、输出错误、出现不可恢复故障等问题。

Method: 提出集成元认知层的架构模式，该层能根据触发条件预测任务失败并主动进行人工交接，同时向用户解释原因。

Result: 原型系统的实证分析显示，该方法显著提高整体任务成功率，但带来了明显的计算开销增加。

Conclusion: 人工交接不应被视为失败，而是增强系统韧性、改善用户体验和建立信任的核心设计特征，还探讨了该方法的实际和伦理影响并指出未来研究方向。

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦马尔可夫决策问题（MDPs）的线性规划（LP）解法，提出用对数障碍函数将LP问题转化为无约束优化问题，旨在为有效解决LP - based MDPs建立理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性规划（LP）方法解决MDPs虽有潜力但因求解不等式约束优化问题困难而较少使用，本文旨在为其建立更有效实用的理论基础。

Method: 利用对数障碍函数将MDP的LP公式转化为无约束优化问题，通过梯度下降获取近似解。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论，目的是填补该方法理论解释的空白。

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在大语言模型中平衡全面安全和细粒度可控性，需新方法实现鲁棒安全对齐并保留实用性。

Method: 提出三阶段框架LATENTGUARD，先在合理化数据集微调模型建立行为先验，再训练结构化变分自编码器学习潜在表征，通过操纵潜在维度实现选择性拒绝。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 8B上实验提升安全可控性和响应可解释性，在Mistral - 7B上验证泛化性。

Conclusion: 结构化表征层面干预为构建更安全实用的大语言模型系统提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

Conclusion: 提出可扩展自学习范式，弥合大语言模型内在知识与临床实践差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

Result: SAGE能生成在对抗性和真实性上平衡更好的场景，且能更有效地进行驾驶策略闭环训练。

Conclusion: SAGE框架在对抗场景生成中表现出色，可有效满足多样化训练和测试需求。

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

Result: 在多个数据集上，该量子启发方法比监督、对比和预训练基线方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 量子启发的保真度可有效提升大语言模型推理轨迹的连贯性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

Result: 在HealthBench上比单模型基线有13倍提升，聚类增强协作对复杂推理任务有效，系统可水平扩展且性能稳定。

Conclusion: 基于结构化协作的语义编排能释放异构AI智能体联盟的集体智慧。

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar
pipelines.

Method: 代理框架结合上下文学习、指令遵循和结构化工具调用能力识别协议元素并修改。

Result: 代理能有效检索协议组件、生成设备兼容协议定义文件并执行用户请求。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的代理支持CT扫描协议管理原则上可行，但面临语法语义和复杂请求处理等挑战。

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) has shown promise
as an inexpensive, ubiquitous, and non-invasive screening tool to detect left
ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric congenital heart disease.
However, current approaches rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which
poses a major obstacle to the democratization of AI in hospitals where only
limited pediatric ECG data are available. In this work, we propose a robust
training framework to improve AI-ECG performance under low-resource conditions.
Specifically, we introduce an on-manifold adversarial perturbation strategy for
pediatric ECGs to generate synthetic noise samples that better reflect
real-world signal variations. Building on this, we develop an uncertainty-aware
adversarial training algorithm that is architecture-agnostic and enhances model
robustness. Evaluation on the real-world pediatric dataset demonstrates that
our method enables low-cost and reliable detection of left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, highlighting its potential for deployment in resource-limited
clinical settings.

Conclusion: 方法能带来有效改进，并在投资模拟中带来有意义的经济收益。

Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets:
news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock
prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their
complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for
improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified
neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using
modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series
patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving
pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal
understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient
token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across
modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal
and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals
insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our
cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these
improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.

Conclusion: D - TFA可改进复合材料力学行为预测，高聚类数对复杂微观结构准确的应力 - 应变响应很关键。

Abstract: A novel homogenization methodology is proposed for analyzing the failure of
fiber-reinforced composite materials, utilizing elastic and eigen influence
tensors within a damage informed transformation field analysis (D-TFA)
framework. This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic
damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic
simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order
modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means
clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's
performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume
element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative
assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes.
Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with
predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole
specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains
with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately
capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved
predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been
demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more
accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.

Abstract: The buildings and construction sector is a significant source of greenhouse
gas emissions, with cement production alone contributing 7~\% of global
emissions and the industry as a whole accounting for approximately 37~\%.
Reducing emissions by optimizing structural design can achieve significant
global benefits. This article introduces an efficient multi-objective
constrained Bayesian optimization approach to address this challenge. Rather
than attempting to determine the full set of non-dominated solutions with
arbitrary trade-offs, the approach searches for a solution matching a specified
trade-off. Structural design is typically conducted using computationally
expensive finite element simulations, whereas Bayesian optimization offers an
efficient approach for optimizing problems that involve such high-cost
simulations. The proposed method integrates proper orthogonal decomposition for
dimensionality reduction of simulation results with Kriging partial least
squares to enhance efficiency. Constrained expected improvement is used as an
acquisition function for Bayesian optimization. The approach is demonstrated
through a case study of a two-lane, three-span post-tensioned concrete bridge
girder, incorporating fifteen design variables and nine constraints. A
comparison with conventional design methods demonstrates the potential of this
optimization approach to achieve substantial cost reductions, with savings of
approximately 10\% to 15\% in financial costs and about 20\% in environmental
costs for the case study, while ensuring structural integrity.

Result: 证明线性多头情况下全实例受限追逐终止是可判定的

Conclusion: 在解决受限追逐终止问题上取得进展

Abstract: The chase is a ubiquitous algorithm in database theory. However, for
existential rules (aka tuple-generating dependencies), its termination is not
guaranteed, and even undecidable in general. The problem of termination becomes
particularly difficult for the restricted (or standard) chase, for which the
order of rule application matters. Thus, decidability of restricted chase
termination is still open for many well-behaved classes such as linear or
guarded multi-headed rules. We make a step forward by showing that
all-instances restricted chase termination is decidable in the linear
multi-headed case.

Result: 结合SQL和Python比单用SQL有益，现有大模型处理该数据集仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合SQL和Python进行文本到SQL转换有优势，但处理复杂分析推理问题仍需提升大模型能力。

Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question
answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely
perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational
databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL,
the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of
expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions
involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as
calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario
understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public
human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on
three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly
using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the
task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data
fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate
that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial
compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging
for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: During the early days of relational database theory it was realized that
"acyclic" database schemas possess a number of desirable semantic properties.
In fact, three different notions of "acyclicity" were identified and
extensively investigated during the 1980s, namely, alpha-acyclicity,
beta-acyclicity, and gamma-acyclicity. Much more recently, the study of
alpha-acyclicity was extended to annotated relations, where the annotations are
values from some positive commutative monoid. The recent results about
alpha-acyclic schemas and annotated relations give rise to results about
beta-acyclic schemas and annotated relations, since a schema is beta-acyclic if
and only if every sub-schema of it is alpha-acyclic. Here, we study
gamma-acyclic schemas and annotated relations. Our main finding is that the
desirable semantic properties of gamma-acyclic schemas extend to annotated
relations, provided the annotations come from a positive commutative monoid
that has the transportation property. Furthermore, the results reported here
shed light on the role of the join of two standard relations, Specifically, our
results reveal that the only relevant property of the join of two standard
relations is that it is a witness to the consistency of the two relations,
provided that these two relations are consistent. For the more abstract setting
of annotated relations, this property of the standard join is captured by the
notion of a consistency witness function, a notion which we systematically
investigate in this work.

Motivation: 现有多模态和实时数据库系统无法满足多模态数据的实时语义搜索和检索需求。

Method: 引入基于LSM存储的统一磁盘二级索引、基于成本的查询优化器和增量物化视图框架，基于开源RocksDB存储和MySQL查询引擎构建。

Result: ARCADE在读密集型工作负载上比领先的多模态数据系统快7.4倍，在写密集型工作负载上快1.4倍。

Conclusion: ARCADE能有效支持高吞吐量摄取和跨多种数据类型的查询处理，性能表现出色。

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data - spanning text, image, video,
spatial, and relational modalities, coupled with the need for real-time
semantic search and retrieval over these data - has outpaced the capabilities
of existing multimodal and real-time database systems, which either lack
efficient ingestion and continuous query capability, or fall short in
supporting expressive hybrid analytics. We introduce ARCADE, a real-time data
system that efficiently supports high-throughput ingestion and expressive
hybrid and continuous query processing across diverse data types. ARCADE
introduces unified disk-based secondary index on LSM-based storage for vector,
spatial, and text data modalities, a comprehensive cost-based query optimizer
for hybrid queries, and an incremental materialized view framework for
efficient continuous queries. Built on open-source RocksDB storage and MySQL
query engine, ARCADE outperforms leading multimodal data systems by up to 7.4x
on read-heavy and 1.4x on write-heavy workloads.

Motivation: 为无环CRPQs评估提供输出敏感算法，避免复杂度依赖正则表达式输出大小。

Method: 分两阶段，第一阶段将查询收缩为自由连通无环查询，第二阶段评估并投影掉提升的绑定变量列。

Result: 在特定问题实例中，算法复杂度低于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提输出敏感算法在一定情况下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Conjunctive Regular Path Queries, or CRPQs for short, are an essential
construct in graph query languages. In this paper, we propose the first
output-sensitive algorithm for evaluating acyclic CRPQs. It is output-sensitive
in the sense that its complexity is a function of the sizes of the input graph
and of the query output. In particular, it does not depend on the output sizes
of the regular expressions that appear in the query, as these sizes can be much
larger than the query output size.
  Our algorithm proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, it contracts the
given query into a free-connex acyclic one such that the output of the original
query can be obtained from the output of the contracted one. This contraction
removes bound variables by composing regular expressions or by promoting bound
variables to free ones. The minimum necessary number of promoted bound
variables gives the contraction width, which is a novel parameter specific to
CRPQs. In the second stage, our algorithm evaluates the free-connex acyclic
CRPQ and projects away the columns of the promoted bound variables. It ensures
output-sensitivity by computing the calibrated outputs of the regular
expressions appearing in the free-connex acyclic CRPQ in time proportional to
their sizes.
  Our algorithm has lower complexity than the state-of-the-art approaches for
problem instances where (i) the query output is asymptotically smaller than the
worst-case output size or (ii) the largest output size of any of the regular
expression in the query.

Motivation: 现代科学仪器数据生成速率超本地计算能力，基于文件的远程HPC资源使用在时间敏感分析和实验控制中不实用，且实时流框架缺乏评估可行性的原则性方法。

Method: 引入定量框架和流速度得分，结合数据生成率、传输效率等关键参数计算总处理完成时间，确定流处理有益的操作范围。

Result: 测量显示高数据率下流处理比基于文件的方法端到端完成时间最多降低97%，最坏情况下拥塞会使传输时间增加一个数量级以上。

Conclusion: 强调尾部延迟在流处理可行性决策中的重要性。

Abstract: Modern scientific instruments generate data at rates that increasingly exceed
local compute capabilities and, when paired with the staging and I/O overheads
of file-based transfers, also render file-based use of remote HPC resources
impractical for time-sensitive analysis and experimental steering. Real-time
streaming frameworks promise to reduce latency and improve system efficiency,
but lack a principled way to assess their feasibility. In this work, we
introduce a quantitative framework and an accompanying Streaming Speed Score to
evaluate whether remote high-performance computing (HPC) resources can provide
timely data processing compared to local alternatives. Our model incorporates
key parameters including data generation rate, transfer efficiency, remote
processing power, and file input/output overhead to compute total processing
completion time and identify operational regimes where streaming is beneficial.
We motivate our methodology with use cases from facilities such as APS, FRIB,
LCLS-II, and the LHC, and validate our approach through an illustrative case
study based on LCLS-II data. Our measurements show that streaming can achieve
up to 97% lower end-to-end completion time than file-based methods under high
data rates, while worst-case congestion can increase transfer times by over an
order of magnitude, underscoring the importance of tail latency in streaming
feasibility decisions.

Motivation: 高效处理大语言模型服务场景中请求动态变化尤其是上下文长度变化很重要，但并行策略存在吞吐量下降问题

Method: 提出Gyges，设计页面友好、以头部为中心的布局加速KV缓存转换，进行专用权重填充加速模型权重转换，使用转换感知调度器协同调度请求和并行转换

Result: 使用真实世界轨迹评估，Gyges相比现有方案吞吐量提升1.75x - 6.57x

Conclusion: Gyges能有效优化大语言模型服务场景中处理请求动态变化的性能，提升整体吞吐量

Abstract: Efficiently processing the dynamics of requests, especially the context
length variance, is important in Large Language Model (LLM) serving scenarios.
However, there is an intrinsic trade-off: while leveraging parallelism
strategies, such as Tensor Parallelism (TP), can coordinate multiple GPUs to
accommodate larger context lengths, it inevitably results in degraded overall
throughput. In this paper, we propose Cross-Instance Parallelism Transformation
(Gyges), which adaptively adjusts the parallelism strategies of running
instances to align with the dynamics of incoming requests. We design (1) a
page-friendly, header-centric layout to accelerate KV cache transformations;
(2) dedicated weight padding to accelerate model weight transformations; and
(3) a transformation-aware scheduler to cooperatively schedule requests and
parallelism transformations, optimizing the overall performance. Evaluations
using real-world traces show that Gyges improves throughput by 1.75x-6.57x
compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Existing methods for training LLMs on long-sequence data, such as Tensor
Parallelism and Context Parallelism, exhibit low Model FLOPs Utilization as
sequence lengths and number of GPUs increase, especially when sequence lengths
exceed 1M tokens. To address these challenges, we propose BurstEngine, an
efficient framework designed to train LLMs on long-sequence data. BurstEngine
introduces BurstAttention, an optimized distributed attention with lower
communication cost than RingAttention. BurstAttention leverages topology-aware
ring communication to fully utilize network bandwidth and incorporates
fine-grained communication-computation overlap. Furthermore, BurstEngine
introduces sequence-level selective checkpointing and fuses the language
modeling head with the loss function to reduce memory cost. Additionally,
BurstEngine introduces workload balance optimization for various types of
attention masking. By integrating these optimizations, BurstEngine achieves a
$1.2\times$ speedup with much lower memory overhead than the state-of-the-art
baselines when training LLMs on extremely long sequences of over 1M tokens. We
have made our code publicly available on GitHub:

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have had a significant impact on domains like
autonomous vehicles and smart cities through low-latency inferencing on edge
computing devices close to the data source. However, DNN training on the edge
is poorly explored. Techniques like federated learning and the growing capacity
of GPU-accelerated edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson motivate the need for a
holistic characterization of DNN training on the edge. Training DNNs is
resource-intensive and can stress an edge's GPU, CPU, memory and storage
capacities. Edge devices also have different resources compared to workstations
and servers, such as slower shared memory and diverse storage media. Here, we
perform a principled study of DNN training on individual devices of three
contemporary Jetson device types: AGX Xavier, Xavier NX and Nano for three
diverse DNN model--dataset combinations. We vary device and training parameters
such as I/O pipelining and parallelism, storage media, mini-batch sizes and
power modes, and examine their effect on CPU and GPU utilization, fetch stalls,
training time, energy usage, and variability. Our analysis exposes several
resource inter-dependencies and counter-intuitive insights, while also helping
quantify known wisdom. Our rigorous study can help tune the training
performance on the edge, trade-off time and energy usage on constrained
devices, and even select an ideal edge hardware for a DNN workload, and, in
future, extend to federated learning too. As an illustration, we use these
results to build a simple model to predict the training time and energy per
epoch for any given DNN across different power modes, with minimal additional
profiling.

Abstract: Edge accelerators such as Nvidia Jetsons are becoming an integral part of the
computing continuum, and are often used for DNN inferencing and training.
Nvidia Jetson edge devices have $2000$+ CUDA cores within a $70$W power
envelope and offer $1000$s of power modes to customize CPU, GPU and memory
frequencies. Their widely varying power--performance trade-offs can be
exploited for energy and power-constrained deployments. While data-driven
methods to predict the power and latency of DNN workloads for edge devices
exist, there is a lack of principled study to understand why edge accelerators
and their power modes perform the way they do. We develop a time roofline and a
novel energy roofline model for the Jetson Orin AGX for diverse power modes,
and couple it with an analytical model of the compute (FLOP) and memory access
(bytes) for DNN inference workloads to analyze them from first principles.
These reveal unique, sometimes counter-intuitive, insights into the power and
performance behavior of DNN workloads on edge accelerators, e.g., the default
power mode MAXN is not the most energy efficient and time efficiency implies
energy efficiency for all power modes. We also extend our analytical roofline
models to DNN training. Finally, we apply these methods to tune the power mode
(and hence the roofline) of the edge device to optimize the latency and energy
for DNN inference, with up to $15\%$ lower energy and minimal degradation in
inference time.

Abstract: The proliferation of GPU accelerated edge devices like Nvidia Jetsons and the
rise in privacy concerns are placing an emphasis on concurrent DNN training and
inferencing on edge devices. Inference and training have different computing
and QoS goals. But edge accelerators like Jetson do not support native GPU
sharing and expose 1000s of power modes. This requires careful time-sharing of
concurrent workloads to meet power--performance goals, while limiting costly
profiling. In this paper, we design an intelligent time-slicing approach for
concurrent DNN training and inferencing on Jetsons. We formulate an
optimization problem to interleave training and inferencing minibatches, and
decide the device power mode and inference minibatch size, while maximizing the
training throughput and staying within latency and power budgets, with modest
profiling costs. We propose GMD, an efficient multi-dimensional gradient
descent search which profiles just $15$ power modes; and ALS, an Active
Learning technique which identifies reusable Pareto-optimal power modes, but
profiles $50$--$150$ power modes. We evaluate these within our Fulcrum
scheduler for $273,000+$ configurations across $15$ DNN workloads. We also
evaluate our strategies on dynamic arrival inference and concurrent inferences.
ALS and GMD outperform simpler and more complex baselines with larger-scale
profiling. Their solutions satisfy the latency and power budget for $>97\%$ of
our runs, and on average are within $7\%$ of the optimal throughput.

Abstract: Federated Learning lends itself as a promising paradigm in enabling
distributed learning for autonomous vehicles applications and ensuring data
privacy while enhancing and refining predictive model performance through
collaborative training on edge client vehicles. However, it remains vulnerable
to various categories of cyber-attacks, necessitating more robust security
measures to effectively mitigate potential threats. Poisoning attacks and
inference attacks are commonly initiated within the federated learning
environment to compromise secure system performance. Secure aggregation can
limit the disclosure of sensitive information from outsider and insider
attackers of the federated learning environment. In this study, our aim is to
conduct an empirical analysis on the transportation image dataset (e.g., LISA
traffic light) using various secure aggregation techniques and multiparty
computation in the presence of diverse categories of cyber-attacks. Multiparty
computation serves as a state-of-the-art security mechanism, offering standard
privacy for secure aggregation of edge autonomous vehicles local model updates
through various security protocols. The presence of adversaries can mislead the
autonomous vehicle learning model, leading to the misclassification of traffic
lights, and resulting in detrimental impacts. This empirical study explores the
resilience of various secure federated learning aggregation techniques and
multiparty computation in safeguarding autonomous vehicle applications against
various cyber threats during both training and inference times.

Abstract: Advanced scientific applications require coupling distributed sensor networks
with centralized high-performance computing facilities. Citrus Under Protective
Screening (CUPS) exemplifies this need in digital agriculture, where citrus
research facilities are instrumented with numerous sensors monitoring
environmental conditions and detecting protective screening damage. CUPS
demands access to computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling environmental
conditions and guiding real-time interventions like water application or
robotic repairs. These computing domains have contrasting properties: sensor
networks provide low-performance, limited-capacity, unreliable data access,
while high-performance facilities offer enormous computing power through
high-latency batch processing. Private 5G networks present novel capabilities
addressing this challenge by providing low latency, high throughput, and
reliability necessary for near-real-time coupling of edge sensor networks with
HPC simulations. This work presents xGFabric, an end-to-end system coupling
sensor networks with HPC facilities through Private 5G networks. The prototype
connects remote sensors via 5G network slicing to HPC systems, enabling

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究线性代数中几个核心问题与矩阵乘法在量子计算机上的复杂度关系。

Method: 先利用Bernstein - Vazirani算法将矩阵乘法量子归约到计算tr(ABC)，再将tr(ABC)归约到所关注的问题。

Result: 发现这些线性代数问题在量子计算机上复杂度与矩阵乘法基本等价，改进算法能带来更快量子矩阵乘法算法。

Conclusion: 改进线性代数问题现有算法复杂度屏障能得到更快的量子矩阵乘法算法，结果补充了现有归约方法。

Abstract: We observe that any $T(n)$ time algorithm (quantum or classical) for several
central linear algebraic problems, such as computing $\det(A)$, $tr(A^3)$, or
$tr(A^{-1})$ for an $n \times n$ integer matrix $A$, yields a $O(T(n)) + \tilde
O(n^2)$ time \textit{quantum algorithm} for $n \times n$ matrix-matrix
multiplication. That is, on quantum computers, the complexity of these problems
is essentially equivalent to that of matrix multiplication. Our results follow
by first observing that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm gives a direct quantum
reduction from matrix multiplication to computing $tr(ABC)$ for $n \times n$
inputs $A,B,C$. We can then reduce $tr(ABC)$ to each of our problems of
interest.
  For the above problems, and many others in linear algebra, their fastest
known algorithms require $\Theta(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \approx 2.37$
is the current exponent of fast matrix multiplication. Our finding shows that
any improvements beyond this barrier would lead to faster quantum algorithms
for matrix multiplication. Our results complement existing reductions from
matrix multiplication in algebraic circuits [BCS13], and reductions that work
for standard classical algorithms, but are not tight -- i.e., which roughly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2ECSS问题的最佳近似比5/4对于许多技术和论证是紧的，不清楚能否改进，因此尝试突破该近似比。

Method: 采用之前工作的方法，将无三角形的2-边覆盖转化为2-边连通生成子图；设计两个互补算法分别处理4-环少和4-环多的情况；使用彩色桥覆盖、丰富顶点和分支粘合路径等新技术。

Result: 提出了一个(5/4 - η)近似算法，其中常数η ≥ 10⁻⁶。

Conclusion: 成功打破了2ECSS问题近似比5/4的自然壁垒，展示了改进近似比的可行性。

Abstract: The 2-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph Problem (2ECSS) is a fundamental
problem in survivable network design. Given an undirected $2$-edge-connected
graph, the goal is to find a $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph with the
minimum number of edges; a graph is 2-edge-connected if it is connected after
the removal of any single edge. 2ECSS is APX-hard and has been extensively
studied in the context of approximation algorithms. Very recently, Bosch-Calvo,
Garg, Grandoni, Hommelsheim, Jabal Ameli, and Lindermayr showed the currently
best-known approximation ratio of $\frac{5}{4}$ [STOC 2025]. This factor is
tight for many of their techniques and arguments, and it was not clear whether
$\frac{5}{4}$ can be improved.
  We break this natural barrier and present a $(\frac{5}{4} -
\eta)$-approximation algorithm, for some constant $\eta \geq 10^{-6}$. On a
high level, we follow the approach of previous works: take a triangle-free
$2$-edge cover and transform it into a 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph by
adding only a few additional edges. For $\geq \frac{5}{4}$-approximations, one
can heavily exploit that a $4$-cycle in the 2-edge cover can ``buy'' one
additional edge. This enables simple and nice techniques, but immediately fails
for our improved approximation ratio. To overcome this, we design two
complementary algorithms that perform well for different scenarios: one for few
$4$-cycles and one for many $4$-cycles. Besides this, there appear more
obstructions when breaching $\frac54$, which we surpass via new techniques such
as colorful bridge covering, rich vertices, and branching gluing paths.

Result: 证明了算法的强竞争边界，在对抗情况下改进了学习增强调度的保证。

Conclusion: 进度条反馈在非预知调度中有重要作用，随机模型是传统最坏情况模型的乐观替代。

Abstract: In non-clairvoyant scheduling, the goal is to minimize the total job
completion time without prior knowledge of individual job processing times.
This classical online optimization problem has recently gained attention
through the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. We introduce a natural
setting in which the scheduler receives continuous feedback in the form of
progress bars: estimates of the fraction of each job completed over time. We
design new algorithms for both adversarial and stochastic progress bars and
prove strong competitive bounds. Our results in the adversarial case
surprisingly induce improved guarantees for learning-augmented scheduling with
job size predictions. We also introduce a general method for combining
scheduling algorithms, yielding further insights in scheduling with
predictions. Finally, we propose a stochastic model of progress bars as a more
optimistic alternative to conventional worst-case models, and present an
asymptotically optimal scheduling algorithm in this setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出三种基于UMAP的快速图绘制算法，实验表明这些算法比朴素应用UMAP和tsNET更快，验证了UMAP用于图绘制的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP用于图绘制未被评估，且朴素应用UMAP进行图绘制时间复杂度高，难以处理大型图。

Method: 提出三种算法：SS - GUMAP利用谱稀疏化降低运行时间；SSL - GUMAP用部分BFS和边采样降低kNN图计算和成本优化时间；SSSL - GUMAP结合前两者达到O(n)运行时间。

Result: SS - GUMAP比GUMAP快28%，SL - GUMAP和SSSL - GUMAP比GUMAP快超80%；GUMAP比tsNET快90%，邻域保留效果相似，质量指标平均好10%。

Conclusion: UMAP用于图绘制是有效的。

Abstract: UMAP is a popular neighborhood-preserving dimension reduction (DR) algorithm.
However, its application for graph drawing has not been evaluated. Moreover, a
naive application of UMAP to graph drawing would include O(nm) time all-pair
shortest path computation, which is not scalable to visualizing large graphs.
  In this paper, we present fast UMAP-based for graph drawing. Specifically, we
present three fast UMAP-based algorithms for graph drawing: (1) The SS-GUMAP
algorithm utilizes spectral sparsification to compute a subgraph G' preserving
important properties of a graph G, reducing the O(nm) component of the runtime
to O(n^2 log n) runtime; (2) The SSL-GUMAP algorithm reduces the kNN (k-Nearest
Neighbors) graph computation from $O(n \log n)$ time to linear time using
partial BFS (Breadth First Search), and the cost optimization runtime from O(n)
time to sublinear time using edge sampling; (3) The SSSL-GUMAP algorithm
combines both approaches, for an overall O(n) runtime.
  Experiments demonstrate that SS-GUMAP runs 28% faster than GUMAP, a naive
application of UMAP to graph drawing, with similar quality metrics, while
SL-GUMAP and SSSL-GUMAP run over 80% faster than GUMAP with less than 15%
difference on average for all quality metrics.
  We also present an evaluation of GUMAP to tsNET, a graph layout based on the
popular DR algorithm t-SNE. GUMAP runs 90% faster than tsNET with similar
neighborhood preservation and, on average, 10% better on quality metrics such
as stress, edge crossing, and shape-based metrics, validating the effectiveness
of UMAP for graph drawing.

Motivation: 降低tsNET算法的时间复杂度，提升其运行效率。

Method: 提出三种算法，分别是O(n log n)时间的BH - tsNET、FIt - tsNET和O(n)时间的L - tsNET，通过优化计算高维概率、KL散度梯度和熵计算三个组件来降低时间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明BH - tsNET、FIt - tsNET和L - tsNET比tsNET分别快93.5%、96%和98.6%，且绘制图形质量相当。

Conclusion: 新提出的三种算法能有效降低tsNET算法的时间复杂度，提升运行效率。

Abstract: The tsNET algorithm utilizes t-SNE to compute high-quality graph drawings,
preserving the neighborhood and clustering structure. We present three fast
algorithms for reducing the time complexity of tsNET algorithm from O(nm) time
to O(n log n) time and O(n) time. To reduce the runtime of tsNET, there are
three components that need to be reduced: (C0) computation of high-dimensional
probabilities, (C1) computation of KL divergence gradient, and (C2) entropy
computation. Specifically, we reduce the overall runtime of tsNET, integrating
our new fast approaches for C0 and C2 with fast t-SNE algorithms for C1. We
first present O(n log n)-time BH-tsNET, based on (C0) new O(n)-time partial
BFS-based high-dimensional probability computation and (C2) new O(n log n)-time
quadtree-based entropy computation, integrated with (C1) O(n log n)-time
quadtree-based KL divergence computation of BH-SNE. We next present faster O(n
log n)-time FIt-tsNET, using (C0) O(n)-time partial BFS-based high-dimensional
probability computation and (C2) quadtree-based O(n log n)-time entropy
computation, integrated with (C1) O(n)-time interpolation-based KL divergence
computation of FIt-SNE. Finally, we present the O(n)-time L-tsNET, integrating
(C2) new O(n)-time FFT-accelerated interpolation-based entropy computation with
(C0) O(n)-time partial BFS-based high-dimensional probability computation, and
(C1) O(n)-time interpolation-based KL divergence computation of FIt-SNE.
Extensive experiments using benchmark data sets confirm that BH-tsNET,
FIt-tsNET, and L-tsNET outperform tsNET, running 93.5%, 96%, and 98.6% faster
while computing similar quality drawings in terms of quality metrics
(neighborhood preservation, stress, edge crossing, and shape-based metrics) and
visual comparison. We also present a comparison between our algorithms and
DRGraph, another dimension reduction-based graph drawing algorithm.

Method: 提出算法并分析其竞争比，给出竞争比的上下界。

Result: 通用情况下确定性算法竞争比为1.6911，下界为1.5877；比例设定下确定性算法竞争比为3/2，随机算法竞争比上下界为6/5和4/3。

Conclusion: 该问题是少数在通用情况下存在竞争性确定性算法的自然在线背包变体。

Abstract: We introduce the Online Unbounded Knapsack Problem with Removal, a variation
of the well-known Online Knapsack Problem. Items, each with a weight and value,
arrive online and an algorithm must decide on whether or not to pack them into
a knapsack with a fixed weight limit. An item may be packed an arbitrary number
of times and items may be removed from the knapsack at any time without cost.
The goal is to maximize the total value of items packed, while respecting a
weight limit. We show that this is one of the very few natural online knapsack
variants that allow for competitive deterministic algorithms in the general
setting, by providing an algorithm with competitivity 1.6911. We complement
this with a lower bound of 1.5877.
  We also analyze the proportional setting, where the weight and value of any
single item agree, and show that deterministic algorithms can be exactly
3/2-competitive. Lastly, we give lower and upper bounds of 6/5 and 4/3 on the
competitivity of randomized algorithms in this setting.

Result: 算法输出近最优广告投放计划，简单启发式方法在多种场景下次优，可通过线性搜索确定最佳广告数量，实验证明策略优于基线。

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效优化广告投放，提升用户对广告的兴趣。

Abstract: Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital
advertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling
policies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,
that overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'
long-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several
psychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).
  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on
three key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and
operant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave
function of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is
modeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user
interest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask
the following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads
should be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the
ads?
  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of
displayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the
operant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm
that outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the
performance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.
Our algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and
shows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many
natural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on
the mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a
simple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings
with experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various
baselines.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the fundamental problems of approximately counting the numbers of
edges and triangles in a graph in sublinear time. Previous algorithms for these
tasks are significantly more efficient under a promise that the arboricity of
the graph is bounded by some parameter $\overline{\alpha}$. However, when this
promise is violated, the estimates given by these algorithms are no longer
guaranteed to be correct.
  For the triangle counting task, we give an algorithm that requires no promise
on the input graph $G$, and computes a $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation for the
number of triangles $t$ in $G$ in time $O^*\left( \frac{m\cdot \alpha(G)}{t} +
\frac{m}{t^{2/3}}
  \right)$, where $\alpha(G)$ is the arboricity of the graph. The algorithm can
be used on any graph $G$ (no prior knowledge the arboricity $\alpha(G)$ is
required), and the algorithm adapts its run-time on the fly based on the graph
$G$.
  We accomplish this by trying a sequence of candidate values $\tilde{\alpha}$
for $\alpha(G)$ and using a novel algorithm in the framework of testable
algorithms. This ensures that wrong candidates $\tilde{\alpha}$ cannot lead to
incorrect estimates: as long as the advice is incorrect, the algorithm detects
it and continues with a new candidate. Once the algorithm accepts the
candidate, its output is guaranteed to be correct with high probability.
  We prove that this approach preserves - up to an additive overhead - the
dramatic efficiency gains obtainable when good arboricity bounds are known in
advance, while ensuring robustness against misleading advice. We further
complement this result with a lower bound, showing that such an overhead is
unavoidable whenever the advice may be faulty.
  We further demonstrate implications of our results for triangle counting in
the streaming model.

Conclusion: 算法有效，通过仿真在多种场景得到验证。

Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these
games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one
player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in
only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game
in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game.
Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game.
This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games
can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and
activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a
distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple
stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made
using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in
Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a
target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate
the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned
above.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, game-theoretic model of deception in
two-player, zero-sum games. Our framework leverages an information asymmetry:
one player (the deceiver) has access to accurate payoff information, while the
other (the victim) observes a modified version of these payoffs due to the
deception strategy employed. The deceiver's objective is to choose a
deception-action pair that optimally exploits the victim's best response to the
altered payoffs, subject to a constraint on the deception's magnitude. We
characterize the optimal deceptive strategy as the solution to a bi-level
optimization problem, and we provide both an exact solution and an efficient
method for computing a high-quality feasible point. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on numerical examples inspired by honeypot
deception.

Motivation: 解决社交媒体上隐式科学声明与原始出版物链接因词汇稀疏等问题带来的阻碍，实现基于证据的事实核查和学术讨论。

Method: 采用两阶段检索管道，第一阶段用基于E5 - large的双编码器，经微调、分块分词和元数据增强；第二阶段用SciBERT交叉编码器进行神经重排。

Result: 优化的稀疏检索基线MRR@5 = 0.5025，使用神经表示提升到MRR@5 = 0.6174，完整管道进一步提升到MRR@5 = 0.6828。

Conclusion: 密集检索与神经重排器结合为推文与研究匹配提供强大高效的解决方案，为未来证据检索管道提供实用蓝图。

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original
publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly
discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and
domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the
CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly
outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval
baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To
surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a
first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using
in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and
rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT
cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations
lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves
to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with
neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study
matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval
pipelines.

Motivation: 传统检索器应对多轮对话存在挑战，查询重写计算成本高，基于大语言模型的检索器未针对多轮场景优化。

Method: 提出ContextualRetriever，引入上下文感知嵌入机制、基于高质量重写查询的意图引导监督和保留基础大语言模型生成能力的训练策略。

Result: 在多个对话搜索基准测试中，ContextualRetriever显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ContextualRetriever能有效解决多轮对话搜索问题，且无额外推理开销。

Abstract: Effective conversational search demands a deep understanding of user intent
across multiple dialogue turns. Users frequently use abbreviations and shift
topics in the middle of conversations, posing challenges for conventional
retrievers. While query rewriting techniques improve clarity, they often incur
significant computational cost due to additional autoregressive steps.
Moreover, although LLM-based retrievers demonstrate strong performance, they
are not explicitly optimized to track user intent in multi-turn settings, often
failing under topic drift or contextual ambiguity. To address these
limitations, we propose ContextualRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever that
directly incorporates conversational context into the retrieval process. Our
approach introduces: (1) a context-aware embedding mechanism that highlights
the current query within the dialogue history; (2) intent-guided supervision
based on high-quality rewritten queries; and (3) a training strategy that
preserves the generative capabilities of the base LLM. Extensive evaluations
across multiple conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that
ContextualRetriever significantly outperforms existing methods while incurring
no additional inference overhead.

Motivation: 当前向量搜索混合查询解决方案在召回率、速度和灵活性上有取舍，依赖不可扩展的索引技巧。

Method: 引入FusedANN框架，通过基于变压器的凸化联合嵌入属性和向量，将硬过滤器转换为连续加权惩罚。

Result: 在标准混合基准测试中实现了更好的召回 - 延迟权衡，吞吐量提高达3倍，召回率优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 建立了符号约束和向量相似性之间的桥梁，为大型、混合和动态NLP/ML工作负载解锁新一代过滤检索系统。

Abstract: Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands
hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g.,
"top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall,
speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We
introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric
framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and
introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method
jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based
convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that
preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove
that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully
relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient,
and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically,
FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages,
achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks
without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and
better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems.
Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules
that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled,
scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector
similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large,
hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.

Motivation: 当前搜索系统用户行为序列方法存在忽略噪声与兴趣纠缠、输出静态无上下文表示的问题，无法适应动态意图变化

Method: 提出Contextual Diffusion Purifier (CDP)，将类别过滤后的行为视为“污染观测”，采用前向加噪和条件反向去噪过程，由交叉交互特征引导，生成纯的、有上下文感知的兴趣表示

Result: 大量离线/在线实验表明CDP优于现有方法

Conclusion: CDP能有效解决现有方法存在的问题，在处理搜索系统用户行为序列上表现更优

Abstract: User behavior sequences in search systems resemble "interest fossils",
capturing genuine intent yet eroded by exposure bias, category drift, and
contextual noise. Current methods predominantly follow an "identify-aggregate"
paradigm, assuming sequences immutably reflect user preferences while
overlooking the organic entanglement of noise and genuine interest. Moreover,
they output static, context-agnostic representations, failing to adapt to
dynamic intent shifts under varying Query-User-Item-Context conditions.
  To resolve this dual challenge, we propose the Contextual Diffusion Purifier
(CDP). By treating category-filtered behaviors as "contaminated observations",
CDP employs a forward noising and conditional reverse denoising process guided
by cross-interaction features (Query x User x Item x Context), controllably
generating pure, context-aware interest representations that dynamically evolve
with scenarios. Extensive offline/online experiments demonstrate the
superiority of CDP over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Certain strong LLMs have shown promise for zero-shot formal planning by

substantially reduced, semantic errors persist in more challenging domains,

Abstract: Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the
learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate
multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open
challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion
mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it
offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item
content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive
representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item
representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among
similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss
could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems
empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive
experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most commonly deployed systems today.
Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to
urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection,
curation, and management procedures. So too has the "human-in-the-loop"
paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability.
However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in
recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully
described. These risks are "codetermined" by the information context in which
such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings
of "human-in-the-loop" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI
systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially
responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight
may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a "cascade" or
"compound" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three
common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in
their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨推荐系统中算法选择问题，通过构建算法特征集改进元学习器，结果显示用户特征预测力占优，算法特征提升选择精度但提升整体性能仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中算法选择问题，克服标准元学习方法将不同算法视为等效黑盒的局限。

Method: 构建综合特征集刻画算法，结合多种特征，评估两个元学习器（仅用用户特征的基线模型和使用用户与算法特征的模型）。

Result: 含算法特征的元学习器平均NDCG@10为0.143，较单最佳算法基线提升11.7%，但未超仅用用户特征的元学习器；算法特征提升Top - 1选择准确率，但降低Top - 3准确率。

Conclusion: 在推荐系统按用户选择算法任务中，用户特征预测力占主导，算法特征提升选择精度，但提升整体性能是挑战。

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is
optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem.
Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm
based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms
themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the
impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set
to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code
metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and
high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five
datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both
user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented
with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically
significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline
(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not
lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user
features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did
improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by
leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user
algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user
features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection
precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a
non-trivial challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推荐系统中冗余和无关信息导致性能下降，以及现有方法不能充分过滤噪声和建模模态间复杂关系的问题。

Method: 提出MRdIB框架，先使用多模态信息瓶颈压缩输入表示过滤噪声，再基于与推荐目标关系将信息分解为独特、冗余和协同组件，并设置相应学习目标优化。

Result: 在多个竞争模型和三个基准数据集上的实验表明MRdIB能有效提升多模态推荐效果。

Conclusion: MRdIB框架有效且通用，能增强多模态推荐。

Abstract: Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by
integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item
characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and
irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods
either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural
separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model
the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled
Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal
Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively
filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information.
Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the
recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We
achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information
learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information
learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning
objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives,
MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations.
Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in
enhancing multimodal recommendation.

Result: 成功开发Muse - it平台。

Conclusion: Muse - it为音乐研究者提供了收集和分析大数据的便捷方式，有助于理解在线音乐参与情况。

Abstract: Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and
emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections.
Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in
natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing
(NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at
scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular,
offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich
discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires
tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a
platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined
queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling,
temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of
large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g.,
Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date,
genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An
interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data.
Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and
analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it
naturally unfolds online.

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上，WFDiffuser有效缓解频移，使轨迹更平滑稳定，决策性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WFDiffuser能有效解决现有方法频域特征利用不足问题，提升离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

Conclusion: 集成深度学习和中心性算法等新兴技术有望提升反洗钱系统的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

Motivation: 标准特征归因方法计算密集，不适合实时应用，需更高效方法。

Method: 提出DeepACTIF方法，针对LSTM网络引入逆加权聚合方案。

Result: 在三个生物识别凝视数据集上，DeepACTIF在特征缩减时保持预测性能，在准确性和统计稳健性上优于SHAP、IG和DeepLIFT，降低错误率。

Conclusion: DeepACTIF减少计算和内存开销，使用顶级特征时保持模型准确性，是边缘设备实时可解释性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

Conclusion: 所提出的使用增强ANFIS的混合分析方法有效，能降低RMSE，在解决信用卡欺诈问题上表现更好。

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid
approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and
accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the
comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating
the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality

researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial

Conclusion: FWSP方法及相关分析有效解决结构化随机多臂老虎机纯探索问题，提出的学习算法有良好效果。

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

Conclusion: 此混合策略是动态环境中维持模型性能的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 需要更稳健的贡献评估方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Conclusion: 基于ABC的方法在解决大语言模型不确定性表达问题上有显著优势，能提升性能。

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected

Motivation: 传统模仿学习算法需专家动作信息，在现实中难获取，因此关注仅需专家状态访问信息的LfO。

Method: 提出LfO框架，用其对现有LfO方法从轨迹构建、假设和算法设计选择方面进行调查分类。

Result: 对现有LfO方法完成分类，建立与多个相关领域联系。

Conclusion: 利用框架识别出开放问题并给出未来研究方向建议。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

Method: 引入TensLoRA统一框架，聚合LoRA更新为高阶张量，对张量低秩适应建模。

Result: 实验表明张量构造直接影响性能，在相似参数数量下有时优于标准LoRA。

Conclusion: TensLoRA框架可行，能根据模态和任务定制参数预算，张量构造对性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing
(HPC) where data is not centralized and privacy is crucial. We present OmniFed,
a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its
architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level
override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies,
mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training
algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential
Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed
streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments. Github repository

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的方法采用固定长度分割，忽略了局部时间动态和预测解码的异质性，导致信息丢失、冗余和无法捕捉不同预测期限的复杂性。

Method: 采用自适应补丁嵌入根据局部信息密度动态调整粒度，引入分段解码将每个预测期限视为相关子任务。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，TimeMosaic比现有方法有持续改进，在大规模语料库上训练的模型性能与最先进的TSFMs具有竞争力。

Conclusion: TimeMosaic能有效解决多元时间序列预测中的时间异质性问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Motivation: 信贷违约数据集存在类别不平衡问题，需要有效方法提升违约预测性能。

Conclusion: 研究为创建更有弹性和适应性的信贷违约系统奠定基础，适应全球信贷交易增长需求。

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI推理查询量和令牌需求增加，可靠的单查询能耗估算对容量规划等至关重要，而许多公开估算不准确。

Method: 引入基于令牌吞吐量的自下而上方法估算大规模大语言模型系统单查询能耗。

Result: 前沿规模模型单查询能耗中位数0.34Wh，非生产估算可能高估4 - 20倍；查询令牌增多能耗上升；各层面有显著节能潜力；不同情景下能耗估算有明显差异。

Conclusion: 针对性的效率干预可显著降低能耗，类似数据中心历史上通过效率提升控制能耗增长。

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

Method: 研究最先进的统计和深度学习概率预测模型，对深度分布神经网络采用集成方法、蒙特卡罗dropout和共形预测，对LASSO估计自回归方法结合分位数回归平均、广义自回归条件异方差和共形预测。

Result: 基于LEAR的模型概率预测表现好，DDNNs结合数据和模型不确定性可提升预测效果，共形预测能更好捕捉不确定性。

Conclusion: 所考虑模型表现有竞争力，相对表现取决于点预测和概率预测的指标选择。

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个强大框架，可通过更准确的性能估计和可操作的风险评估，提高深度学习系统的可靠性和可信度，尤其适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Motivation: 现有CFTL基准测试方法无法准确评估其性能，存在依赖小规模数据集、样本量处理不当等问题。

Method: 统一重新实现广泛采用的神经预测网络以适应CFTL设置，仅在专有和合成数据上预训练并防止测试泄漏，在15个大型多样公共预测竞赛数据集上评估。

Conclusion: 现有CFTL基准测试方法存在缺陷，统计模型表现优于现有FFM，合成数据预训练对FFM有提升作用。

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Result: 提出的谱缩放方法能显著提升性能，在简单调节Δt失效的场景也有效。

Conclusion: 研究为具有结构化转移矩阵的状态空间模型更好地进行长度泛化提供途径。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

Conclusion: 该方法为非平衡涨落系统的PINNs提供了新的有效策略。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

Motivation: 变量数量是MTS中Transformer建模可扩展性的主要瓶颈，无差别变量间混合会导致噪声积累和性能下降，且可扩展性和性能在Transformer设计中常相互冲突，需同时改善二者。

Method: 提出DELTAformer方法，通过委托令牌约束变量间建模，进行全量、无约束的跨时间建模，委托令牌作为隐式正则化器。

Result: DELTAformer与变量数量呈线性缩放，性能优于标准Transformer，在基准测试和基线测试中达到了最先进水平，在噪声环境中能更好聚焦相关信号，抗噪能力更强。

Conclusion: 通过使模型设计利用MTS特定领域挑战，DELTAformer可在实现线性缩放的同时提升性能。

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

TL;DR: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) 学习耗散动力学，避免长滚动伴随问题，有时间保证，在机械基准测试中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经替代模型注入能量使长时程预测不稳定的问题。

Method: 在向量场和结构保留采样器中构建保守 - 耗散分裂，通过条件流匹配进行短转换训练，推理时使用Strang - prox方案，可选投影确保严格能量衰减。

Result: 在机械基准测试中，MCFM的相图更接近真实情况，能量增加和正能量率事件更少，且终端分布拟合效果相当。

Conclusion: MCFM能在不违反第一性原理的情况下学习耗散动力学，保证能量守恒、单调耗散和稳定预测。

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Result: 给出不同动力算子（如Koopman、Perron - Frobenius和Schrödinger算子）的结果，有数值示例。

Conclusion: 该框架有优势也有不足。

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

Conclusion: DAWM模型能有效且高效地用于离线RL训练，提升算法性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Conclusion: LSD和LSD+方法能有效解决离散扩散模型采样效率和质量问题。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

Conclusion: 该方法虽在发展中，但提供了系统解读模型行为的新途径。

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

Result: 几何感知噪声在高曲率流形上提升泛化性和超参数选择鲁棒性，在简单流形上表现不逊于无噪声训练。

Conclusion: 所提框架可扩展到学习的数据流形。

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在ReLU神经网络稀疏恢复上有效且性能较好。

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Conclusion: 该框架减少实验数据需求、可进行模块识别，有望简化合成生物电路及多模块系统设计。

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

Conclusion: 所开发的多模态模型可对有潜力的候选抗体进行优先级排序，减少实验的无效工作。

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

Conclusion: 所提方法在时间序列索引方面有更好的表现，能有效减少信息损失。

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

Conclusion: TIMED框架能有效捕捉时间序列数据的无条件和条件方面，在生成合成时间序列上优于现有模型。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

TL;DR: 文章指出现有基于提示的联邦持续学习（FCL）方法存在类知识一致性问题，提出C²Prompt方法解决，实验显示其达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的FCL方法存在类知识一致性问题，会加剧时空遗忘，需要解决。

Method: 提出C²Prompt方法，引入本地类分布补偿机制（LCDC）减少客户端间类内分布差异，设计类感知提示聚合方案（CPA）减轻类间知识混淆。

Result: 在多个FCL基准测试上的实验表明C²Prompt达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: C²Prompt方法能有效解决现有基于提示的FCL方法的类知识一致性问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

Motivation: 解决持续学习中梯度步长不再带来性能提升，准确率停滞或下降的可训练性损失问题。

Method: 从优化视角分析Adam的可训练性损失，引入批大小感知的梯度噪声边界和曲率波动控制边界形成预测阈值，构建每层调度器。

Result: 该调度器能稳定训练，在多种场景下提升准确率，学习率轨迹类似经典衰减。

Conclusion: 所提出的预测阈值和调度器能有效应对Adam优化器的可训练性损失问题。

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Motivation: 探索变压器在矩阵补全任务中是否能隐式发现通用求解方法，验证上下文学习能力。

Method: 在数百万个掩码块矩阵补全任务上训练线性注意力变压器，仅使用输入输出对和均方损失。

Result: 训练后发现跨三种计算机制的无参数更新规则，该规则在全批量问题上二阶收敛，降低分布式迭代复杂度，在秩受限注意力下保持准确。

Conclusion: 仅训练补全缺失块的变压器能隐式发现统一、资源自适应的迭代求解器，凸显上下文学习强大能力。

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计方法难以处理复杂异构数据，在高风险手术场景中准确估计ITE受限。

Method: 开发多任务元学习框架X - MultiTask，将每个手术决策建模为独立任务并学习共享表示，在训练目标中加入逆概率加权（IPW）。

Result: 在公共脊柱融合数据集和私人AIS数据集上，模型在治疗效果估计上优于基线，指标表现良好。

Conclusion: X - MultiTask能提供稳健的患者特定因果估计，是推进个性化手术护理和改善患者结局的有力工具。

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

ABP prediction using speech signals employing a BERT based regression model
Arterial blood pressure is a vital indicator of cardiovascular health and
accurate monitoring is essential in preventing hypertension related

due to factors like whitecoat and masked hypertension Our approach leverages
the acoustic characteristics of speech capturing voice features to establish
correlations with blood pressure levels Utilizing advanced deep learning
techniques we analyze speech signals to extract relevant patterns enabling real
time monitoring without the discomfort of conventional methods In our study we
employed a dataset comprising recordings from 95 participants ensuring diverse
representation The BERT model was fine tuned on extracted features from speech
leading to impressive performance metrics achieving a mean absolute error MAE
of 136 mmHg for systolic blood pressure SBP and 124 mmHg for diastolic blood
pressure DBP with R scores of 099 and 094 respectively These results indicate
the models robustness in accurately predicting blood pressure levels
Furthermore the training and validation loss analysis demonstrates effective
learning and minimal overfitting Our findings suggest that integrating deep
learning with speech analysis presents a viable alternative for blood pressure
monitoring paving the way for improved applications in telemedicine and remote

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss
functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization
compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training
accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a
student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

Result: 方法在PPG到ECG转换和心血管疾病检测上有效，合成ECG获得心脏病专家认可，有高保真度，提高诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法有用于现实世界心血管筛查的潜力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在大型驾驶数据集上评估，处理显著更少代理时，在整体进度、安全和性能方面达到与现有技术相当的驾驶性能。

Conclusion: RDAR能学习准确的相关性数值度量，有效降低输入元素同时保持驾驶性能。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

Method: 提出VCRL课程强化学习框架，根据组奖励方差动态控制训练样本难度。

Result: 在五个数学基准和两个模型上的实验表明VCRL优于当前LLM RL基线。

Conclusion: VCRL是一种有效的方法，能在数学推理任务上提升大语言模型表现。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Conclusion: CSF可实现跨不同非线性系统的可扩展基于分数的滤波。

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is
available as a Python package at https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-resampling/ .

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Motivation: 现有多校准方法在工业界应用有限，存在需手动指定子组、不可扩展、损害其他模型性能指标等问题。

Method: 提出不需要显式指定受保护组、可扩展且能改善其他ML评估指标的MCGrad算法。

Result: MCGrad已在Meta投入生产，成为数百个生产模型的一部分，并给出了部署结果和公开数据集上的结果。

Conclusion: MCGrad算法能有效解决现有多校准方法的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Result: 模型在死亡率预测中表现优于监督基线，尤其在小数据集上。

Conclusion: 自监督基础模型在重症监护时间序列中有潜力支持资源受限环境下的临床应用。

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型训练中缺乏高质量训练问题，人工数据集成本高且有限，现有合成语料易或范围窄。

Method: 提出PromptCoT 2.0框架，用期望最大化（EM）循环替代手工启发式方法，迭代优化推理来指导提示构建。

Result: 自玩中，应用于Qwen3 - 30B - A3B - Thinking - 2507在多任务创30B规模新记录；监督微调中，训练Qwen2.5 - 7B - Instruct在多项任务准确率超人类或混合数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: PromptCoT 2.0使提示合成成为推理扩展新方向，为未来开源模型提供可扩展基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.

Motivation: 现有少样本生成方法存在过拟合、模式崩溃、继承偏差和忽略隐空间几何结构等问题，需要新方法解决。

Method: 引入LIRF方法，用新的流形保留损失函数训练自编码器建立稳定隐空间，提出迭代生成 - 校正 - 增强循环，有几何校正算子和收敛定理。

Result: 在AFHQ - Cat上生成了连贯的高分辨率图像，消融实验证实流形保留隐空间和收缩校正机制是成功的关键。

Conclusion: LIRF为数据稀缺的生成式建模提供了理论有依据且实践有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

Result: VLMs存在‘知行差距’，在理想场景中VLM指导能显著提高早期样本效率。

Conclusion: 明确了使用基础模型指导探索而非端到端控制的潜力和限制。

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Conclusion: 这是首个将引出概率与MMSE关联，并使用多模态构建提高可解释性的ADReSS研究。

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,
and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains
transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this
is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use
multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

Conclusion: TABFAIRGDT是现实世界中对公平性敏感应用的理想解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

Result: TimePrism在五个基准数据集的两个指标上取得10个结果中的9个最优。

Conclusion: 概率场景范式有潜力，为预测领域开辟了超越采样的研究方向。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

Motivation: 现有LoRA微调与全训练存在差距，需改进LoRA步骤

Method: 将LoRA优化转化为可解释子问题，用交替最小二乘法高效求解，支持动量并提出实验性缩放变体

Result: 在多个任务中，OPLoRA以显著更少内存接近SVDLoRA性能

Conclusion: OPLoRA是一种内存高效的优化器，能有效缩小与SVDLoRA的性能差距

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear
task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches
SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

Result: 在四个不同解剖结构的数据集上评估，实现了最先进的性能，使模型更精准关注异常区域和关键指标。

Conclusion: RAD框架具有可推广性，能确保基于证据的、可信的诊断，代码开源。

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code
is available at https://github.com/tdlhl/RAD.

Conclusion: 将物理信息先验嵌入注意力机制为复杂多变量系统的异常检测提供了一种校准且鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub
repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

Conclusion: 历史聚合方法在解决部分可观测的渗透测试问题中效果良好。

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子机器学习模型依赖大量测量，导致推理成本高和时间开销大。

Method: 用概率聚合机制替代Pauli期望值输出，引入鼓励明确预测的损失函数。

Result: 理论分析表明避免了基于期望值模型的测量扩展限制，实验显示在不同测量预算和退极化信道模拟下均优于基线。

Conclusion: Yomo能实现准确的单次测量推理，大幅降低量子机器学习部署的财务和计算成本，降低实际应用门槛。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

Conclusion: Aerial+在高维数据关联规则挖掘中表现出色，提出的微调方法在低数据高维场景有效。

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 揭示了数据分布引导嵌入结构形成的机制，建立了嵌入组织与语义模式关系的新理解。

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Conclusion: 模型损失梯度与生成器流形越对齐，越易受MIAs攻击；提出的新方法能有效提升攻击效果。

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

Result: StrAD在五个真实世界异常检测数据集上提升了现有基于重建模型的性能。

Conclusion: StrAD方法有效，通过结合结构信息能增强模型对逐点和模式异常的敏感性。

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: FairEquityFL框架在解决动态异构车联网环境下联邦学习客户端选择公平性问题上表现良好，有较好的应用前景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Conclusion: 提出能处理自适应时间步长的T - HénonNets架构，但处理非分离哈密顿系统有困难。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，该方法对重学习和越狱攻击更具鲁棒性，同时保持有竞争力的实用性能。

Conclusion: StableUN框架能有效解决现有LLM遗忘方法的安全漏洞，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Conclusion: 模型具有鲁棒性、有效性和强迁移性，为复杂ncRNA功能分类提供新策略。

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA
functional classification. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 结合结构化滞后、发票级结算建模和行为洞察可提高稀疏金融时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online

exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

*Prabhat Karmakar,Sayan Gupta,Ilaksh Adlakha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出扩展低秩近似（xLRA）框架，高效预测微观结构的弹性响应，数据效率高、可迁移且性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测异质材料微观结构与力学响应的关系很重要，但因微观结构特征复杂高维、物理模拟计算成本高，且现有数据驱动方法需大量数据，故需开发高效工具。

Method: 提出xLRA框架，采用典范多线性张量分解，自适应纳入高阶项，将高维微观结构信息映射到局部弹性响应。

Result: xLRA能准确预测多孔微观结构的局部弹性应变场，仅需4阶最大秩；用5%数据集训练就能准确预测，具数据效率；在多种材料系统有可迁移性；性能优于当代方法，浮点运算少6个数量级。

Conclusion: xLRA为从微观结构预测弹性响应提供了高效框架，可实现结构 - 属性联系的可扩展映射。

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

Conclusion: 指出设计失败会损害基准有效性，给出构建更好、考虑可靠性的基于大语言模型评判基准的可行原则。

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

Method: 引入ESD复杂度度量，分析序列模型的极小极大超额风险，研究过参数化梯度流对ESD的影响，将框架拓展到线性模型和RKHS回归，进行数值实验。

Result: 对于ESD至多为K的序列模型，极小极大超额风险为σ²K；过参数化梯度流可降低ESD。

Conclusion: ESD框架为谱算法泛化性提供新视角，超越传统固定核理论。

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNN）建模动态演变的时空信号存在挑战，且GNN假定已有底层图结构，而这种结构不一定存在，因此需要新方法。

Method: 基于图变量信号分析（GVSA）和图信号处理工具，引入GVNNs，其层将时空信号与依赖信号的连通性张量进行卷积。

Result: 在预测基准上，GVNNs始终优于强大的基于图的基线模型，且与LSTM和Transformer等常用序列模型有竞争力；在脑电图运动想象分类中，GVNNs取得了高准确率。

Conclusion: GVNNs在建模动态演变的时空信号方面有良好效果，在脑机接口应用方面有潜力。

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

Method: 展示Veo 3解决多种未明确训练任务的能力。

Result: Veo 3能解决分割物体、检测边缘等多种任务，具备早期视觉推理能力。

Conclusion: 视频模型正朝着统一、通用的视觉基础模型发展。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

Result: 发现时间一致性现象，该现象支持泛化，对未见和损坏数据有效，语义结构破坏时崩溃，SGD注入各向异性噪声。

Conclusion: 提出将特征动态与泛化联系起来的概念视角，为测量时间特征演化的实用替代方法提供研究方向。

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these
reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the
basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Motivation: 现有生产系统依赖表格梯度提升决策树独立评分会话，忽略在线活动的关系和时间结构，无法应对协调攻击和“欺诈圈”，需要更好的ATO检测方法。

Method: 将ATO检测重新表述为在尊重时间的有向会话图上进行时空节点分类，通过共享标识符链接实体，用时间窗口和近期性约束调节连接，使用归纳式GraphSAGE变体通过邻居采样进行训练。

Result: 在Capital One的高风险数字产品上，ATLAS使AUC提高6.38%，客户摩擦减少超50%。

Conclusion: ATLAS能在提高欺诈捕获率的同时减少用户摩擦。

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Conclusion: 为制药制造关键应用开发可靠且可泛化的预测解决方案提供了路线图。

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Conclusion: MEGP是一个结构自适应且可解释的框架，推动了进化机器学习的新兴方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Multi-population Ensemble Genetic Programming (MEGP), a
computational intelligence framework that integrates cooperative coevolution
and the multiview learning paradigm to address classification challenges in
high-dimensional and heterogeneous feature spaces. MEGP decomposes the input
space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple
subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic
ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose
outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer,
enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid
selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness
promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population
diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search
exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across
eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a
baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization
performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant
improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also
exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout
evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven
evolutionary learning. By unifying population-based optimization, multi-view
representation learning, and cooperative coevolution, MEGP contributes a
structurally adaptive and interpretable framework that advances emerging
directions in evolutionary machine learning.

Conclusion: GMPEA在解决时间敏感的约束多目标优化问题上具有优越性。

Abstract: Real world constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) are
prevalent and often come with stringent time-sensitive requirements. However,
most contemporary constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs)
suffer from a number of drawbacks, including complex designs, low computational
efficiency, and long convergence times, which are particularly pronounced when
addressing time-sensitive CMOPs. Although research on accelerating evolutionary
algorithms using GPU parallelism has advanced, existing CMOEAs still face
significant limitations within GPU frameworks. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a GPU-accelerated multi-population evolutionary algorithm,
termed GMPEA. We first systematically analyze the performance bottlenecks of
representative CMOEAs when implemented in a GPU environment. To address the
trade-off between computational speed and solution performance, GMPEA
introduces a decomposition-based multi-population approach that is fully
parallelized across its entire workflow. We conducted comparative experiments
on various benchmark tests and real world applications: the Weapon Target
Assignment Problems. The results demonstrate that GMPEA achieves competitive
performance even without time constraints, while its computational speed
significantly surpasses that of the compared algorithms. More critically, under
a strict time limit, the performance of GMPEA drastically outperforms its
counterparts. This work provides compelling evidence of GMPEA's superiority in
solving time-sensitive CMOPs.

Motivation: 当前Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks (KANs) 因高维样条参数空间冗余，存在过拟合和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 引入P - KANs，利用信号分析和稀疏字典学习中的熵最小化技术，通过对投影系数的熵分析识别最优表示。

Result: P - KANs在多领域表现出色，参数最多减少80%，抗噪性显著提升，成功应用于工业自动纤维放置预测。

Conclusion: 该方法能自动发现混合功能表示，为科学机器学习应用提供压缩优势和增强的可解释性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from
nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine
learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations
suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional
spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield
functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance
space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and
poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery
towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation
techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than
constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline
space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage
convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight
recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy
analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to
lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs
demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80%
parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly
improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful
application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach
enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different
edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits
and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.

Result: 在图像识别、图像生成和序列回归等多个基准测试中，BSD算法性能与经典误差反向传播训练的网络相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现是神经网络中基于生物原理、脉冲驱动学习的重要一步。

Abstract: Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve
performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding
challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by
entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both
positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can
represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we
introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning
algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We
formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations
(i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network
implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while
the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from
concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including
image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD
achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error
backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward
biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks.

Motivation: 现有TTS缩放方法仅关注计算最优前沿，未考虑计算最优并非系统最优。

Method: 从系统驱动视角分析推理模型在延迟和每令牌成本等实际指标上的缩放情况，评估张量并行和推测解码等优化的影响。

Result: 初步分析揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要向全面、系统感知的评估进行范式转变，以捕捉推理时缩放定律的本质。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has recently emerged as a promising direction to
exploit the hidden reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models
(LLMs). However, existing scaling methods narrowly focus on the compute-optimal
Pareto-frontier, ignoring the simple fact that compute-optimal is not always
system-optimal. In this work, we propose a system-driven perspective on TTS,
analyzing how reasoning models scale against practical metrics, such as latency
and cost-per-token. By evaluating the impact of popular optimizations such as
tensor parallelism and speculative decoding, our preliminary analysis reveals
the limitations of current methods and calls for a paradigm shift toward

### [168] [Automated Insertion of Flushes and Fences for Persistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19459)
*Yutong Guo,Weiyu Luo,Brian Demsky*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出编译器PMRobust，自动插入flush和fence操作以消除持久内存代码中缺失相关操作的错误，评估显示开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具难确保代码无缺失flush错误，且常需bug测试用例，因此需新方法解决。

Method: 使用针对新分配对象优化的新型静态分析技术，开发编译器PMRobust自动插入操作。

Result: 在持久内存库和数据结构上评估，相对手动放置操作的基准测试，几何平均开销为0.26%。

Conclusion: PMRobust能有效消除缺失flush和fence操作的错误，且开销低。

Abstract: CXL shared memory and persistent memory allow the contents of memory to
persist beyond crashes. Stores to persistent or CXL memory are typically not
immediately made persistent; developers must manually flush the corresponding
cache lines to force the data to be written to the underlying storage.
Correctly using flush and fence operations is known to be challenging. While
state-of-the-art tools can find missing flush instructions, they often require
bug-revealing test cases. No existing tools can ensure the absence of missing
flush bugs.
  In this paper, we present PMRobust, a compiler that automatically inserts
flush and fence operations to ensure that code using persistent memory is free
from missing flush and fence bugs. PMRobust employs a novel static analysis
with optimizations that target newly allocated objects. We have evaluated
PMRobust on persistent memory libraries and several persistent memory data
structures and measured a geometric mean overhead of 0.26% relative to the
original benchmarks with hand-placed flush and fence operations.

### [169] [Semantic-Aware Fuzzing: An Empirical Framework for LLM-Guided, Reasoning-Driven Input Mutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19533)
*Mengdi Lu,Steven Ding,Furkan Alaca,Philippe Charland*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 文章提出开源微服务框架将推理大语言模型与AFL++集成于FuzzBench，评估相关研究问题，实验表明Deepseek最有潜力，指出响应延迟和吞吐量瓶颈待解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于变异的模糊测试器缺乏语义推理，有推理能力的大语言模型虽有优势但难以监督微调，因此探索基于提示的少样本学习。

Method: 提出开源微服务框架，将推理大语言模型与AFL++集成于Google的FuzzBench，并评估四个研究问题。

Result: 实验表明Deepseek最有潜力，变异有效性更多取决于提示复杂度和模型选择而非样本数量。

Conclusion: 响应延迟和吞吐量瓶颈是关键障碍，为未来工作指明方向。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and
autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while
effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits
without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use
dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural
constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and
domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large
language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input
formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like
an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground
truth for "correct" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning
impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based
few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices
framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench,
tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs.
CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1)
How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do
few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt
engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which
open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions?
Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3
highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more
on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and
throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future
work.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型能否从源代码自动恢复用户故事及提示设计对输出质量的影响，对5种模型用6种提示策略评估，小模型加示例可媲美大模型，思维链推理对大模型增益有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户故事在敏捷开发中重要，但在遗留和文档不完善系统常缺失或过时，探究大语言模型能否从源代码自动恢复用户故事及提示设计对输出质量的影响。

Method: 使用1750个不同复杂度的C++代码片段，对5种最先进的大语言模型采用6种提示策略进行评估。

Result: 所有模型对最多200行非注释代码平均F1分数达0.8，小的8B模型加单个示例能达到70B大模型性能，思维链推理对大模型只有微小增益。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可用于从源代码自动恢复用户故事，提示设计中示例对小模型提升效果显著，思维链推理对大模型作用有限。

Abstract: User stories are essential in agile development, yet often missing or
outdated in legacy and poorly documented systems. We investigate whether large
language models (LLMs) can automatically recover user stories directly from
source code and how prompt design impacts output quality. Using 1,750 annotated
C++ snippets of varying complexity, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs
across six prompting strategies. Results show that all models achieve, on
average, an F1 score of 0.8 for code up to 200 NLOC. Our findings show that a
single illustrative example enables the smallest model (8B) to match the
performance of a much larger 70B model. In contrast, structured reasoning via
Chain-of-Thought offers only marginal gains, primarily for larger models.

TL;DR: 本文评估四个FIM大语言模型生成断言消息的能力，发现Codestral - 22B表现最佳，含描述性测试注释可提升其性能，还指出模型和评估指标的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者和自动测试生成工具常省略断言消息，大语言模型生成断言消息能力未被系统评估。

Method: 在含开发者编写断言消息的Java测试方法数据集上评估四个FIM大语言模型，采用类人评估方法和消融研究、结构分析。

Result: Codestral - 22B质量得分最高为2.76（满分5分），手动编写为3.24；含描述性测试注释可将其得分提升到2.97；所有模型常复制开发者偏好的语言模式。

Conclusion: 研究为推进测试代码中自动化、上下文感知的断言消息生成提供基础，同时指出所选模型和传统文本评估指标的局限性。

Abstract: Assertion messages significantly enhance unit tests by clearly explaining the
reasons behind test failures, yet they are frequently omitted by developers and
automated test-generation tools. Despite recent advancements, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have not been systematically evaluated for their ability to
generate informative assertion messages. In this paper, we introduce an
evaluation of four state-of-the-art Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) LLMs -
Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, Codestral-22B, CodeLlama-13B, and StarCoder - on a dataset
of 216 Java test methods containing developer-written assertion messages. We
find that Codestral-22B achieves the highest quality score of 2.76 out of 5
using a human-like evaluation approach, compared to 3.24 for manually written
messages. Our ablation study shows that including descriptive test comments
further improves Codestral's performance to 2.97, highlighting the critical
role of context in generating clear assertion messages. Structural analysis
demonstrates that all models frequently replicate developers' preferred
linguistic patterns. We discuss the limitations of the selected models and
conventional text evaluation metrics in capturing diverse assertion message
structures. Our benchmark, evaluation results, and discussions provide an
essential foundation for advancing automated, context-aware generation of
assertion messages in test code. A replication package is available at

Motivation: 对企业级部署的AI辅助软件开发工具进行全面的现实世界评估。

Method: 让300名工程师将内部AI平台DeputyDev集成到日常工作流，进行严格的队列分析。

Result: 生产力显著提升，PR审查周期缩短31.8%；开发者满意度高，采用率从第1个月的4%增至第6个月的83%并稳定在60%；顶级采用者代码推送量增加61%，该工具贡献约30 - 40%的生产代码，代码发货量总体增加28%。

Conclusion: 纵向分析为生产环境提供实证，揭示AI融入企业软件开发工作流的变革潜力和实际部署挑战。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of AI-assisted software
development tools deployed at enterprise scale. Over one year, 300 engineers
across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that
combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily
workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates
statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8%
reduction in PR review cycle time.
  Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features
and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns
showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by
month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61%
increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30
to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an
overall 28% increase in code shipment volume.
  Unlike controlled benchmark evaluations, our longitudinal analysis provides
empirical evidence from production environments, revealing both the
transformative potential and practical deployment challenges of integrating AI
into enterprise software development workflows.

TL;DR: 在多语言编程中，现有方法孤立处理目标语言。XL - CoGen 用协调多智能体架构应对挑战，实验显示其有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件系统基于异构栈，大语言模型在不同编程语言中的表现差异大，现有解决方案孤立处理目标语言，缺乏知识共享。

Method: 采用协调多智能体架构，集成中间表示、代码生成、翻译和自动修复，用数据驱动机制选择桥接语言，进行早期输出验证和迭代纠错。

Result: XL - CoGen 比最强微调基线提高 13 个百分点，比现有单语言多智能体方法最多提高 30 个百分点，消融研究表明兼容性引导桥接显著优于基于大语言模型的启发式方法。

Conclusion: XL - CoGen 能有效实现跨语言知识的累积转移，具有较高价值。

Abstract: Producing high-quality code across multiple programming languages is
increasingly important as today's software systems are built on heterogeneous
stacks. Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the state of automated
programming, yet their proficiency varies sharply between languages, especially
those with limited training data such as Rust, Perl, OCaml, and Erlang. Many
current solutions including language-specific fine-tuning, multi-agent
orchestration, transfer learning, and intermediate-representation pipelines
still approach each target language in isolation, missing opportunities to
share knowledge or exploit recurring cross-language patterns.
  XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture
that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and
automated repair. Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for
selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify
the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success
rather than raw generation accuracy. The system performs early output
validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as
contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations.
  Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13
percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30
percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods. Ablation
studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly
outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative
cross-language knowledge transfer.

Motivation: 开源社区神经网络仓库迭代快，传统SBOM和概念性AIBOM不适用于神经网络软件演化分析，需新方法。

Method: 引入NNBOM，从55,997个PyTorch GitHub仓库创建大规模NNBOM数据库，开展实证研究。

Result: 对神经网络软件演化进行全面实证研究，得到软件规模、组件复用和跨领域依赖等方面趋势。

Conclusion: 开发的两个原型应用证明了分析的实用价值。

Abstract: Neural networks have become integral to many fields due to their exceptional
performance. The open-source community has witnessed a rapid influx of neural
network (NN) repositories with fast-paced iterations, making it crucial for
practitioners to analyze their evolution to guide development and stay ahead of
trends. While extensive research has explored traditional software evolution
using Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), these are ill-suited for NN software,
which relies on pre-defined modules and pre-trained models (PTMs) with distinct
component structures and reuse patterns. Conceptual AI Bills of Materials
(AIBOMs) also lack practical implementations for large-scale evolutionary
analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neural Network Bill of Material
(NNBOM), a comprehensive dataset construct tailored for NN software. We create
a large-scale NNBOM database from 55,997 curated PyTorch GitHub repositories,
cataloging their TPLs, PTMs, and modules. Leveraging this database, we conduct
a comprehensive empirical study of neural network software evolution across
software scale, component reuse, and inter-domain dependency, providing
maintainers and developers with a holistic view of its long-term trends.
Building on these findings, we develop two prototype applications,
\textit{Multi repository Evolution Analyzer} and \textit{Single repository
Component Assessor and Recommender}, to demonstrate the practical value of our
analysis.

Motivation: 现有代码基准多关注单模态，忽视游戏特定指标，无法满足实际游戏开发需求。

Method: 采用基于聚类的精选方法构建含2219个高质量样本的V - GameGym基准，引入多模态评估框架和自动化LLM驱动的视觉代码合成管道。

Result: V - GameGym有效弥合代码生成准确性与实际游戏开发工作流程的差距。

Conclusion: V - GameGym能为可视化编程和交互元素生成提供可量化的质量指标。

Abstract: Code large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
programming tasks, yet current benchmarks primarily focus on single modality
rather than visual game development. Most existing code-related benchmarks
evaluate syntax correctness and execution accuracy, overlooking critical
game-specific metrics such as playability, visual aesthetics, and user
engagement that are essential for real-world deployment. To address the gap
between current LLM capabilities in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive
programming versus the comprehensive requirements of practical game
development, we present V-GameGym, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,219
high-quality samples across 100 thematic clusters derived from real-world
repositories, adopting a novel clustering-based curation methodology to ensure
both diversity and structural completeness. Further, we introduce a multimodal
evaluation framework with an automated LLM-driven pipeline for visual code
synthesis using complete UI sandbox environments. Our extensive analysis
reveals that V-GameGym effectively bridges the gap between code generation
accuracy and practical game development workflows, providing quantifiable
quality metrics for visual programming and interactive element generation.

Motivation: 现有自动化可追溯性方法受训练数据稀缺和语义鸿沟挑战，本文旨在解决需求可追溯性中的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型的基于提示的技术生成增强的需求到代码的跟踪链接，使用四种大语言模型（Gemini 1.5 Pro、Claude 3、GPT - 3.5 和 GPT - 4），采用零样本和少样本模板，优化追踪模型的编码器。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提升模型性能，F1分数最高提升28.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Requirements traceability is crucial in software engineering to ensure
consistency between requirements and code. However, existing automated
traceability methods are constrained by the scarcity of training data and
challenges in bridging the semantic gap between artifacts. This study aims to
address the data scarcity problem in requirements traceability by employing
large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation. We propose a novel approach
that utilizes prompt-based techniques with LLMs to generate augmented
requirement-to-code trace links, thereby enhancing the training dataset. Four
LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) were used, employing both
zero-shot and few-shot templates. Moreover, we optimized the encoder component
of the tracing model to improve its efficiency and adaptability to augmented
data. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) proposing and evaluating
four prompt templates for data augmentation; (2) providing a comparative
analysis of four LLMs for generating trace links; (3) enhancing the model's
encoder for improved adaptability to augmented datasets. Experimental results
show that our approach significantly enhances model performance, achieving an
F1 score improvement of up to 28.59%, thus demonstrating its effectiveness and
potential for practical application.

Method: 提出数据集和评估管道来评估大语言模型生成Web API调用代码的能力，并对多个开源大语言模型进行实验。

Result: 生成API调用存在重大挑战，会出现幻觉端点、参数使用错误等问题，评估的开源模型解决任务比例均不超40%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成Web API调用代码方面面临较大困难，当前开源模型表现不佳。

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling
software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies,
writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is
challenging. Although large language models~(LLMs) have become popular in
software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web
API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present a
dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to
generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs
reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting
in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of
the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在Verilog生成中因特定领域知识有限存在挑战，采样技术提供的不确定候选方案无法满足硬件工程师对可靠解决方案的需求。

Method: 将其表述为需求与Verilog实现的语义对齐问题，提出VCD - RNK判别器模型，通过代码语义分析、测试用例生成和功能正确性评估三个维度融入特定推理，推理时模拟上述过程避免计算密集的测试执行。

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in Verilog generation due to limited
domain-specific knowledge. While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics,
hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain
candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem
between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a
discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking.
Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling
expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case
generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the
above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids
computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.

Abstract: Ensuring the integrity of business processes without disclosing confidential
business information is a major challenge in inter-organizational processes.
This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the
verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We
integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines
through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation.
Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof
compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model
sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove
and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive
information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for
their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical
integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle.
Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process
verification under given confidentiality constraints.

Result: I/O语法能正确完整指定高级协议特性，实现输出验证，系统覆盖I/O语法比随机方法更快覆盖输入和响应空间。

Conclusion: 所提结合输入生成与输出检查的协议测试方法有效，比随机方法更优。

Abstract: Generating software tests faces two fundamental problems. First, one needs to
_generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet
sufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check
outputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent
in _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and
outputs are the responses of these parties.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines
input generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O
grammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics
of protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation,
based on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a
_test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a
_server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found
in any existing tool or formalism. User-defined _constraints}_can have the
generator focus on arbitrary protocol features; $k$-path guidance
systematically covers states, messages, responses, and value alternatives in a
unified fashion.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to several
protocols, including DNS, FTP, and SMTP. We demonstrate that I/O grammars can
specify advanced protocol features correctly and completely, while also
enabling output validation of the programs under test. In its evaluation, we
find that systematic coverage of the I/O grammar results in much quicker
coverage of the input and response spaces (and thus functionality) compared to
the random-based state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: This study investigates the real-world impact of the generative AI (GenAI)
tool GitHub Copilot on developer activity and perceived productivity. We
conducted a mixed-methods case study in NAV IT, a large public sector agile
organization. We analyzed 26,317 unique non-merge commits from 703 of NAV IT's
GitHub repositories over a two-year period, focusing on commit-based activity
metrics from 25 Copilot users and 14 non-users. The analysis was complemented
by survey responses on their roles and perceived productivity, as well as 13
interviews. Our analysis of activity metrics revealed that individuals who used
Copilot were consistently more active than non-users, even prior to Copilot's
introduction. We did not find any statistically significant changes in
commit-based activity for Copilot users after they adopted the tool, although
minor increases were observed. This suggests a discrepancy between changes in
commit-based metrics and the subjective experience of productivity.

Conclusion: 指出使用数据驱动模型生成保留复杂时间依赖的金融时间序列存在挑战与机遇。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical investigation of the presence
of long-range dependence (LRD) in the dynamics of major U.S. stock market
indexes--S\&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq--at daily, weekly, and monthly
frequencies. We employ three distinct methods: the classical rescaled range
(R/S) analysis, the more robust detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a
sophisticated ARFIMA--FIGARCH model with Student's $t$-distributed innovations.
Our results confirm the presence of LRD, primarily driven by long memory in
volatility rather than in the mean returns. Building on these findings, we
explore the capability of a modern deep learning approach, Quant generative
adversarial networks (GANs), to learn and replicate the LRD observed in the
empirical data. While Quant GANs effectively capture heavy-tailed distributions
and some aspects of volatility clustering, they suffer from significant
limitations in reproducing the LRD, particularly at higher frequencies. This
work highlights the challenges and opportunities in using data-driven models
for generating realistic financial time series that preserve complex temporal
dependencies.

Conclusion: 提出的锚定朗之万动力学方法能适应不可微目标和某些重尾分布，数值实验验证了理论和性能。

Abstract: Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin
algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are
widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high
dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they
require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable
components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We
propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates
non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions.
The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential
and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish
non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target
distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time
change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to
illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a
navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage
status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and
costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random
Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage
probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To
find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning
framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy
iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in
informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base
updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework
supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement
learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty
quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating
and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate
consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses
navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or
clustered natural hazards.

Result: 在科学数据集和图像的复杂高维依赖建模中，所提方法性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 工作增强了Copulas模型的表示能力，为其在更大规模和更具挑战性的领域应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Copulas are a fundamental tool for modelling multivariate dependencies in
data, forming the method of choice in diverse fields and applications. However,
the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional
dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this
work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of
diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget
inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions
unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain
copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each
process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first
instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the
second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula
approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from
scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of
copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on
larger scales and more challenging domains.

Method: 提出MAGIC框架，在分层多任务高斯过程结合功能逻辑回归中同时进行类信息缺失值插补和标签预测，用泰勒展开近似处理难处理的似然分量，用带块坐标优化的EM算法进行参数估计。

Result: 在两个医疗应用中，MAGIC的预测准确性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC能利用有限样本实时准确预测，有助于早期临床评估和治疗规划，让医疗人员做出更明智决策。

Abstract: Time series analysis has emerged as an important tool for improving patient
diagnosis and management in healthcare applications. However, these
applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data
sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step
process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk
Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework
that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label
prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with
functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components,
MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and
parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate
optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two
healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement
following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality
within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves
superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to
generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates
early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers
to make more informed treatment decisions.

*Eunji Lim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A common way to estimate an unknown convex regression function $f_0: \Omega
\subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from a set of $n$ noisy
observations is to fit a convex function that minimizes the sum of squared
errors. However, this estimator is known for its tendency to overfit near the
boundary of $\Omega$, posing significant challenges in real-world applications.
In this paper, we introduce a new estimator of $f_0$ that avoids this
overfitting by minimizing a penalty on the subgradient while enforcing an upper
bound $s_n$ on the sum of squared errors. The key advantage of this method is
that $s_n$ can be directly estimated from the data. We establish the uniform
almost sure consistency of the proposed estimator and its subgradient over
$\Omega$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and derive convergence rates. The
effectiveness of our estimator is illustrated through its application to
estimating waiting times in a single-server queue.

Motivation: 解决高维动态工业过程的统计过程控制问题。

Method: 提出两种监测框架，一是利用流形拟合技术近似流形并使用新控制图监测偏差；二是先将数据嵌入低维空间再监测。

Result: 两种方法都有可控的第一类错误概率，流形拟合方法性能有时优于经典方法，且能在实际图像数据集检测异常。

Conclusion: 概念更简单的流形拟合方法在故障检测上有竞争力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We address the Statistical Process Control (SPC) of high-dimensional, dynamic
industrial processes from two complementary perspectives: manifold fitting and
manifold learning, both of which assume data lies on an underlying nonlinear,
lower dimensional space. We propose two distinct monitoring frameworks for
online or 'phase II' Statistical Process Control (SPC). The first method
leverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately
approximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient
high-dimensional space. It then monitors deviations from this manifold using a
novel scalar distribution-free control chart. In contrast, the second method
adopts a more traditional approach, akin to those used in linear dimensionality
reduction SPC techniques, by first embedding the data into a lower-dimensional
space before monitoring the embedded observations. We prove how both methods
provide a controllable Type I error probability, after which they are
contrasted for their corresponding fault detection ability. Extensive numerical
experiments on a synthetic process and on a replicated Tennessee Eastman
Process show that the conceptually simpler manifold-fitting approach achieves
performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, the more classical
lower-dimensional manifold monitoring methods. In addition, we demonstrate the
practical applicability of the proposed manifold-fitting approach by
successfully detecting surface anomalies in a real image dataset of electrical
commutators.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出用于贝叶斯反演的几何自动编码器（GABI）框架，通过学习含不同几何形状系统的数据集生成几何感知先验，结合似然得到后验分布，经多场景测试表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程系统几何复杂多变，标准贝叶斯不确定性量化（UQ）方法难以使用，需要新方法解决从少量噪声观测中恢复物理系统全场信息的高不适定问题。

Method: 引入GABI框架，遵循“先学习，后观测”范式，将不同几何系统数据信息提炼为丰富潜在先验，推理时结合观测过程似然得到后验分布，采用近似贝叶斯计算（ABC）采样并利用GPU硬件。

Result: 在多个测试场景中，预测精度在监督学习适用的受限环境中与确定性监督学习方法相当，UQ在复杂几何问题上校准良好且稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了灵活的、几何感知的、一次训练多处使用的基础模型，且独立于特定观测过程。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering
applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of
physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly
ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and
variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work,
we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework
for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve
as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion.
Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information
from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring
knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes,
into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined
with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a
geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture
agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling
yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test
our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source
localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the
predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning
approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable;
UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex
geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware
train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular
observation process.

Motivation: 基因组扰动实验高效设计对药物发现和靶点识别很重要，但全基因组扰动不可行，现有贝叶斯优化方法未充分利用生物先验知识。

Method: 提出BioBO方法，将贝叶斯优化与多模式基因嵌入和富集分析结合，在原则框架下结合生物先验与采集函数。

Result: 在公共基准和数据集实验中，BioBO提高标记效率25 - 40%，更有效识别高性能扰动，优于传统BO。

Conclusion: BioBO能提高基因组扰动实验设计效率，且通过富集分析提供通路级解释，具有机制可解释性。

Abstract: Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for
accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet
exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast
search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints.
Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting
informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit
domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed
Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization
with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for
gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition
strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition
functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising
genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through
experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that
BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms
conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively.
Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level
explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability
that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Result: 得到首次灭绝时间的闭式定律，均值与Wright - Fisher结果一致，用线性成本表达式替代指数成本评估，模拟验证结果，并展示对模型崩溃的预测能力

Conclusion: 结果暗示了重采样灭绝动力学的统一观点

Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often
intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$
present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating
multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift,
yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the
mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby
replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we
validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate
predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset
of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed
from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a
unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Abstract: This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for
stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the
control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the
mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The
associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations
combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The
regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs),
exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are
introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our
value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and
rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze
how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a
relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate
how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing
of American options.

representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our

Abstract: The random dot product graph is a popular model for network data with
extensions that accommodate dynamic (time-varying) networks. However, two
significant deficiencies exist in the dynamic random dot product graph
literature: (1) no coherent Bayesian way to update one's prior beliefs about
the latent positions in dynamic random dot product graphs due to their
complicated constraints, and (2) no approach to forecast future networks with
meaningful uncertainty quantification. This work proposes a generalized
Bayesian framework that addresses these needs using a Gibbs posterior that
represents a coherent updating of Bayesian beliefs based on a least-squares
loss function. We establish the consistency and contraction rate of this Gibbs
posterior under commonly adopted Gaussian random walk priors. For estimation,
we develop a fast Gibbs sampler with a time complexity for sampling the latent
positions that is linear in the observed edges in the dynamic network, which is
substantially faster than existing exact samplers. Simulations and an
application to forecasting international conflicts show that the proposed
method's in-sample and forecasting performance outperforms competitors.

Conclusion: chiseling框架在子组选择上有效，能在最少假设下控制发现无效子组的概率。

Abstract: In regression and causal inference, controlled subgroup selection aims to
identify, with inferential guarantees, a subgroup (defined as a subset of the
covariate space) on which the average response or treatment effect is above a
given threshold. E.g., in a clinical trial, it may be of interest to find a
subgroup with a positive average treatment effect. However, existing methods
either lack inferential guarantees, heavily restrict the search for the
subgroup, or sacrifice efficiency by naive data splitting. We propose a novel
framework called chiseling that allows the analyst to interactively refine and
test a candidate subgroup by iteratively shrinking it. The sole restriction is
that the shrinkage direction only depends on the points outside the current
subgroup, but otherwise the analyst may leverage any prior information or
machine learning algorithm. Despite this flexibility, chiseling controls the
probability that the discovered subgroup is null (e.g., has a non-positive
average treatment effect) under minimal assumptions: for example, in randomized
experiments, this inferential validity guarantee holds under only bounded
moment conditions. When applied to a variety of simulated datasets and a real
survey experiment, chiseling identifies substantially better subgroups than
existing methods with inferential guarantees.

Abstract: The advent of Scientific Machine Learning has heralded a transformative era
in scientific discovery, driving progress across diverse domains. Central to
this progress is uncovering scientific laws from experimental data through
symbolic regression. However, existing approaches are dominated by heuristic
algorithms or data-hungry black-box methods, which often demand low-noise
settings and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Motivated by
interpretable Statistical Artificial Intelligence, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework for symbolic regression that represents scientific laws as
ensembles of tree-structured symbolic expressions endowed with a regularized
tree prior. This coherent probabilistic formulation enables full posterior
inference via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, yielding a
balance between predictive accuracy and structural parsimony. To guide symbolic
model selection, we develop a marginal posterior-based criterion adhering to
the Occam's window principle and further quantify structural fidelity to ground
truth through a tailored expression-distance metric. On the theoretical front,
we establish near-minimax rate of Bayesian posterior concentration, providing
the first rigorous guarantee in context of symbolic regression. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates robust performance of our proposed methodology against
state-of-the-art competing modules on a simulated example, a suite of canonical
Feynman equations, and single-atom catalysis dataset.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of high-quality synthetic data -- generated by
advanced AI models or collected as auxiliary data from related tasks --
presents both opportunities and challenges for statistical inference. This
paper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that
wraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample
efficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages
high-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults
to the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of
low quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound
without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as
the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless
integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and
multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method.
We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited
labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing

Abstract: Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer
rewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage
increased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on
customers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although
regression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference
tasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds,
strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address
this issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under
threshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending
distribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers
strategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those
unaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach
consisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a
sample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting
posterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore,
we extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate
heterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable
inference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate
their practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.

TL;DR: 论文针对少样本类别增量学习问题，提出MoTiC框架，实验取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSCIL方法中，新类原型因数据稀缺有估计偏差，需解决学习新类和保留旧类知识的双重挑战。

Method: 通过贝叶斯分析对齐新类先验与旧类统计，提出大规模对比学习，将动量自监督和虚拟类别集成到MoTiC框架。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，尤其在细粒度任务CUB - 200上表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提方法能减少估计偏差，提高增量学习鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

TL;DR: 提出指数角边缘损失函数ExpFace，可强调干净样本并抑制噪声样本，统一分析显示其优势，实验达SOTA水平且开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于边缘的softmax损失函数忽略了噪声样本的影响，希望解决该问题。

Method: 通过观察样本在角空间的分布特点，提出引入角指数项作为边缘的Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace)，并进行统一分析。

Result: ExpFace避免了SphereFace的训练不稳定性和ArcFace的非单调性，相似性曲线与角空间决策边界惩罚方式相同，实验达到了先进水平。

Conclusion: ExpFace是一种有效的人脸识别损失函数，能提升人脸识别性能。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Conclusion: 所提出的感知系统能有效用于露天矿和发展中国家非均匀地形的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统目标检测方法在低光照和严重遮挡等复杂场景下因缺乏高层语义理解而性能下降。

Method: 先通过指令微调使MLLM生成结构化场景描述，再设计自适应映射机制将语义信息转换为边缘检测器的参数调整信号，在边缘云协同推理框架中根据置信度选择调用云语义引导或直接输出边缘检测结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂场景下能有效平衡目标检测的精度和效率。

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

Method: 将神经元对输出的贡献分解为单个计算路径，分析神经元和注意力头的两两组合，将神经元 - 头对与文本关联。

Result: 神经元 - 头对可近似为单一方向，只有稀疏集有显著贡献，部分代表子概念；在无训练语义分割中表现优于先前方法，可监测数据集分布偏移。

Conclusion: 研究单个计算路径能发现可解释单元并用于下游任务。

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有可解释投诉挖掘工作中，用户难以通过文本或视频清晰表达投诉，本文旨在帮助普通用户撰写富有表现力的投诉。

Method: 引入含1175个投诉视频及对应描述的ComVID数据集；提出CR评估指标；使用RAG嵌入的VideoLLaMA2 - 7b模型生成投诉；用多种评估指标对多个视频语言模型进行综合评估。

Result: 对多个视频语言模型在多个任务上进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: 为用户通过视频表达投诉的新研究方向奠定基础，数据集和资源可在指定链接获取。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and

TL;DR: 本文用机器学习方法解决高分辨率传感器云与云阴影检测问题，对比传统和深度学习方法，表明深度学习模型效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效检测云与云阴影是高光谱遥感准确反演大气甲烷等痕量气体浓度的关键前提，对于MethaneSAT和MethaneAIR任务尤为重要。

Method: 部署并评估传统方法（迭代逻辑回归ILR、多层感知器MLP）和先进深度学习架构（UNet、光谱通道注意力网络SCAN）。

Result: 传统方法在空间连贯性和边界定义上有困难，深度学习模型大幅提高检测质量，UNet在保留空间结构上表现最佳，SCAN在捕捉精细边界细节上更优，在MethaneSAT数据上SCAN超越UNet。

Conclusion: 先进深度学习架构在云与云阴影筛选方面有优势，能为增强现有和下一代高光谱任务的甲烷排放量化能力提供可靠、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 归一化的DINOv2嵌入更符合解剖结构，是异常检测的优秀表示。代码开源。

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Conclusion: 需要超越准确率的稳健评估，为构建更安全可靠的医学大视觉语言模型提供可行指导。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

*Zhi Qin Tan,Xiatian Zhu,Owen Addison,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出U - Mamba2 - SSL半监督学习框架用于CBCT中牙齿和牙髓分割，在验证集表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT中牙齿和牙髓准确分割需专业知识且耗时，需要有效利用无标签数据的自动化算法。

Method: 基于U - Mamba2模型，采用多阶段训练策略，先自监督预训练，再通过一致性正则化利用无标签数据，最后用降低损失权重的伪标签策略。

Result: U - Mamba2 - SSL在验证集上平均得分0.872，DSC为0.969。

Conclusion: U - Mamba2 - SSL方法性能优越，代码公开。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is
available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出针对VLM - AD的通用伪装攻击（UCA）框架，实验表明其能诱导错误驾驶指令，超现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM - AD易受对抗攻击，现有攻击方法存在难以直接迁移到VLM - AD系统、多集中在数字层面等问题。

Method: 提出UCA框架，在特征空间生成物理可实现的伪装纹理，引入特征差异损失（FDL），采用多尺度学习策略并调整采样率。

Result: UCA能在多种VLM - AD模型和驾驶场景中诱导错误驾驶指令，3 - P指标提升30%，在不同视角和动态条件下有强攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UCA框架有较高实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

TL;DR: 重新审视CNN固有纹理偏向假设，提出框架量化特征依赖，发现CNN主要依赖局部形状特征，不同领域模型特征依赖模式有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视CNN固有纹理偏向假设，解决前人实验局限。

Method: 提出领域无关框架，通过系统抑制形状、纹理和颜色线索量化特征依赖，在控制抑制条件下评估人类和神经网络。

Result: CNNs并非固有纹理偏向，主要依赖局部形状特征，现代训练策略或架构可缓解该依赖；不同领域模型特征依赖模式有差异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可有效量化特征依赖，不同领域模型在特征依赖上存在系统差异。

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at
https://github.com/tomburgert/feature-reliance.

TL;DR: 介绍多智能体强化学习（MARL）中异构多智能体强化学习（HeMARL）研究现状，指出缺乏标准化测试平台问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HeMARL有大量现实场景应用但研究不足，且缺乏标准化测试平台。

Method: 未提及

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: HeMARL领域缺乏标准化测试平台，导致新研究常使用简单或弱异构环境。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which
gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to
a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in
this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where
agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based
on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving
heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,
as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical
robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and
SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.
However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative
HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,
where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL
environments.

TL;DR: 提出知识基感知（KBA）编排方法，结合静态描述与动态相关性信号，实现更准确自适应任务路由，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统编排方法依赖静态描述，在动态环境中会导致任务路由效率低下。

Method: 引入KBA编排，在静态描述不足时，编排器并行提示子智能体，智能体根据私有知识库评估任务相关性并返回轻量级ACK信号，填充共享语义缓存。

Result: 基准测试显示KBA编排方法在路由精度和系统整体效率上显著优于静态描述驱动的方法。

Conclusion: KBA编排方法适合需要高精度的大规模系统，能实现准确自适应任务路由，同时保留智能体自主性和数据保密性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly tasked with solving complex,
knowledge-intensive problems where effective agent orchestration is critical.
Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which
often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task
routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities
continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a
novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,
privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal
knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are
insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the
subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against
its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the
underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,
providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By
combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves
more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data
confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly
outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall
system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require
higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.

Motivation: 当前将大语言模型算子集成到声明式查询语言的方法存在性能瓶颈，需解决生成输出与数据库规则对齐问题。

Method: 研究不同大小开源语言模型在基于SQL的查询语言中解析和执行函数的能力，提出确保大语言模型函数类型良好性的高效解决方案。

Result: 小语言模型可作为混合数据源的函数执行器，在多跳问答数据集上准确率提升7%，延迟改善53%。

Conclusion: 提出的方案能有效解决集成大语言模型算子到查询语言中的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We
make our implementation available at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql

Motivation: 任务导向对话系统的静态探索策略无法适应动态对话上下文，导致探索效率低和性能不佳。

Method: 提出DyBBT框架，通过结构化认知状态空间处理探索挑战，用受多臂老虎机启发的元控制器根据实时认知状态和访问计数在两种推理模式间切换。

Result: 在单域和多域基准测试中，DyBBT在成功率、效率和泛化性上达到了最优，人工评估显示其决策与专家判断一致。

Conclusion: DyBBT框架有效提升了任务导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Task oriented dialog systems often rely on static exploration strategies that
do not adapt to dynamic dialog contexts, leading to inefficient exploration and
suboptimal performance. We propose DyBBT, a novel dialog policy learning
framework that formalizes the exploration challenge through a structured
cognitive state space capturing dialog progression, user uncertainty, and slot
dependency. DyBBT proposes a bandit inspired meta-controller that dynamically
switches between a fast intuitive inference (System 1) and a slow deliberative
reasoner (System 2) based on real-time cognitive states and visitation counts.
Extensive experiments on single- and multi-domain benchmarks show that DyBBT
achieves state-of-the-art performance in success rate, efficiency, and
generalization, with human evaluations confirming its decisions are well
aligned with expert judgment. Code is available at

Method: 提出Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA)框架，包含分层LoRA架构、光谱联合域槽聚类和语义增强SVD初始化。

Result: 在MultiWOZ和SGD多领域数据集上实验，HiCoLoRA优于基线模型，达到零样本对话状态跟踪的最优结果。

Conclusion: HiCoLoRA框架能有效解决零样本对话状态跟踪的语义不对齐问题，实现更好的零样本槽推理。

Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly
data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between
dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer
coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this,
we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a
framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt
alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic
layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and
higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot
Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear
Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization
(SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain
datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving
SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.

benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem

faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of

Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for
clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data
models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing
benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to
evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical
questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies
(direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns
(single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs.
code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of
retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning
over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We
publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite
(https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research
and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

Conclusion: 提出的可扩展协议能让LLM基于专业的所有者提供的数据，增强响应并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models
(LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a
user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the
usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can
be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner
creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about
dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created
a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the
metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some
features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that
represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading
and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and
grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for
the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,
for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses
containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that
it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code
interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by
Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for
dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing
responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the
Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .

Motivation: 现有高维向量比较的基线方法（点积和余弦相似度）存在局限，点积无界且对向量范数敏感，余弦相似度丢弃大小信息。

Method: 提出OS和HTS两个函数，用四种先进句子嵌入模型在八个标准NLP基准测试中评估，使用Wilcoxon符号秩检验。

Result: 在需要整体语义理解的任务上，OS和HTS在均方误差上显著优于点积和余弦相似度。

Conclusion: 在需要整体语义理解的任务上，考虑向量大小的指标是更优选择；对测试细微组合语义的基准测试效果不佳，是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is
dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and
sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude
information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and
rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity
metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic
Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment
in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and
generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four
state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across
a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora,
and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my
results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding
(paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant
improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine
similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings
delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks
requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my
magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This
significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly
nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of
representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for
future work.

Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the
traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language
models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate
competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for
critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains
limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and
structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against
human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683
papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and
generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in
descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and
methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative
example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths
section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in
identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback
based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real
reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to
weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed
across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for
understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the
development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more

Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel
treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive
and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large
language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic
review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases
and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial
matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies
focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only
(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only
(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real
patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics
limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the
GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in
matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising
strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o
model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models
for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital
infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently
large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as
reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This
review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,
highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,
more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be
critical for broader deployment.

TL;DR: 文章提出量化组合性的评估方法，评估不同数据类型和模型层的组合性，发现后期训练和深层有更强组合信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在组合性上存在问题，静态词嵌入过度宣称组合性，SOTA模型对上下文意义变化无限制，需量化组合性。

Method: 形式化两步广义评估，先通过典型相关分析测量已知实体属性和嵌入的线性关系，再通过重构未见过属性组合的嵌入评估加法泛化。

Result: 评估了句子、知识图和词嵌入，跟踪各层和训练阶段的组合性，发现后期训练阶段和基于Transformer模型深层有更强组合信号，顶层会下降。

Conclusion: 提出的评估方法可量化语言模型的加法组合性，代码开源。

Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is
critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is
justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of
numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps".
Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims
about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph
models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits
on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality,
we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity
between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation
analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing
embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction
metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These
metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down.
Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the
compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional
signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in
deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

Conclusion: POPE框架在大语言模型的多元偏好评估和对齐方面有效且可行。

Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences
requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing
preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ
substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus
solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending
Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,
remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy
Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference
evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that
combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference
signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component
inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic
alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we
derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately
evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed
IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy
evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to
further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE
efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models'
general capabilities on downstream tasks

Motivation: 大语言模型在适应不同认知能力用户方面存在困难，存在知识水平和呈现风格的认知不对齐问题。

Method: 提出Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF)框架，集成基于层次知识图谱的能力感知检索模块和基于布鲁姆分类法与偏好学习的风格优化模块，还有知识可控生成组件；构建SCALE数据集。

Result: CLAF能增强大语言模型输出在不同用户群体中的适应性和信息性。

Conclusion: CLAF为现实应用中的认知水平对齐提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to
users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term
cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level
misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user
understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone
hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the
Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation
framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with
user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a
hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's
taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable
generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.
To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated
dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query.
Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness
of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to
cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language,
a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily
as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in
northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has
been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no
work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The
aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the
Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied
machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF,
an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score
of 85% is achieved.

Motivation: 传统评估指标会误判多模态生成文档解析系统结构不同但语义正确的输出，无法准确评估系统行为。

Method: 引入SCORE框架，集成调整编辑距离、令牌级诊断、带空间容差和语义对齐的表格评估、层次感知一致性检查。

Result: SCORE能揭示标准指标遗漏的跨数据集性能模式，纠正传统指标对模糊表格结构页面的误判，在不依赖目标检测管道的情况下重现传统分数。

Conclusion: SCORE为现代文档解析系统的语义基准评估奠定了公平、实用的基础。

Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional
evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce
semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional
metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing
valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an
interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance
for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish
hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance
and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together,
these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity
while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE
consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard
metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics
penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE
corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid
interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a
format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g.,
table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines,
demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive
evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and
providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes
foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical
benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

Result: 在三个真实世界基准上的实验表明，TriSPrompt比最先进方法的准确率提高了13%以上。

Conclusion: TriSPrompt模型能有效检测不完整多模态数据中的谣言，具有良好性能。

Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a
significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing
multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality
representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them
ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt
model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts,
\textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM)
prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in
incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous
information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available
data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in
incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The
MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and
image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively
detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 结构化地理空间数据能增强语言模型的空间推理能力，为灾难响应构建更有效的离线人工智能系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range
of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about
geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This
gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is
critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this
work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the
geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from
OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data
for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to
key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations
using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on
three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles,
Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification,
nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show
that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This
demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language
models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI
systems for disaster response.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型个性化响应评估主要关注与用户偏好的一致性，忽视了事实性，本文旨在评估模型在事实准确和符合用户偏好两方面的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入PERG框架和PERGData数据集，用不同提示方法评估五个模型家族的十四个模型，提出Pref - Aligner两阶段方法。

Result: 当前大语言模型在鲁棒个性化方面存在困难，强模型在无个性化时5%的成功案例会出错，小模型出错率超20%，查询性质和用户偏好类型显著影响鲁棒性，Pref - Aligner方法平均提升25%的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在关键差距，本文引入的工具和指标有助于更可靠、符合用户需求的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses
of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on
whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality
is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of
personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both
factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we
introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along
with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different
model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that
current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models
(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously
successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)
can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is
significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user
preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage
approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work
highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools
and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

Motivation: 现有针对对齐大语言模型的攻击方法存在收敛性有限、提示不自然和计算成本高的问题，需新攻击范式。

Method: 引入语义表示攻击，利用语义表示空间，提出语义表示启发式搜索算法生成对抗性提示。

Result: 在18个大语言模型上平均攻击成功率达89.41%，11个模型达100%，兼具隐蔽性和效率。

Conclusion: 语义表示攻击整体表现优越。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to
prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent
them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure,
here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high
computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the
semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent
harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and
prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to
efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by
maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and
demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates
(89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while
maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our
Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent,

actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model
behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language
model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less
system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理成本高，早期退出自推测解码（EESD）在实际中难以达到预期加速效果，分析发现只有多数草稿令牌被接受时EESD才有效，否则可能导致负加速。

Method: 提出Pipeline - Parallel Self - Speculative Decoding (PPSD)，将模型层配置成流水线，使早期退出（草稿）计算和剩余层（验证）计算重叠，按令牌交错进行起草和验证。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，PPSD的加速比在2.01x~3.81x之间，在固定接受率和退出位置下几乎实现了最优加速。

Conclusion: PPSD在自推测大语言模型推理中实现了最先进的加速，在提供高效自推测方面具有先进性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur
very high inference cost because each output token is generated
auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative
decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many
approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such
draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and
selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the
vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft
cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To
mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)
that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is
wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the
model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and
remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and
verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its
final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a
verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly
analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical
results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in
self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup
ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration
at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in
providing efficient self-speculation.

Method: 提出P - C - G架构，按角色分离规划、调用和生成，采用韩语优先价值策略，通过LLM - as - a - Judge协议评估。

Result: P - C - G在工具使用准确性和端到端质量上有竞争力，减少了令牌使用并保持可接受的延迟。

Conclusion: 角色专业化的SLM是韩语工具使用代理的经济有效替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture,
Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G
separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an
initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a
normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator
integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first
value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English
code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean
tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain,
missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface.
Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end
quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating
that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use
agents.

Motivation: 现有自动调研方法将大纲写作作为整体流程步骤，生成的大纲缺乏对调研主题的深入理解和细粒度风格，需改进。

Result: 8B推理模型表现出高结构保真度和风格连贯性的强性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Meow元数据驱动的大纲写作框架能有效生成有组织且可靠的大纲。

Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth
surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline
writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for
automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat
outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such
template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of
the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we
propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces
organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate
outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured
outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys
from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics
for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training
approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B
reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity
and stylistic coherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to
their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However,
without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized
knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that
strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially
improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this
infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields
insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic
forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the
phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic
experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point:
each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention
capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale
consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a
knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain
knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts.
Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets
validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在开放式、开放领域环境中作为策略提问者的能力。

Method: 引入GuessingGame协议，提出基于贝叶斯和基于ConceptNet熵的两种信息增益指标。

Result: 在858场游戏中，信息增益与效率强相关，信息增益增加一个标准差可使预期游戏长度减少43%，基于信息增益的提示约束可提升较弱模型的表现。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的提问能力可测量和改进，对交互式推理至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A
Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an
Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question
quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that
tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an
entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are
model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple
models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a
one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%.
Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,
enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show
that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for
interactive reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型难以准确捕捉行人与司机交互行为的复杂性，需要更好的建模方法。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型，采用结合领域知识、结构化推理和少样本提示的新提示设计。

Result: 将最先进的大语言模型与传统分类器进行基准测试，GPT - 4o准确率和召回率最高，Deepseek - V3精度出色。

Conclusion: 模型性能和计算效率存在关键权衡，为在现实行人安全系统中部署大语言模型提供实用指导。

Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly
influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver
yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at
intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.
Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and
context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due
to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited
interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for
extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling
of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal
LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,
structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and
context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application
of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art
LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves
the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These
findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and
computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in
real-world pedestrian safety systems.

Result: ShinkaEvolve在多样任务中提升样本效率和解决方案质量，如发现新的圆填充解决方案、设计高性能代理框架等。

Conclusion: ShinkaEvolve具有广泛适用性和出色样本效率，通过开源和成本效益，使开放式发现适用于多样计算问题。

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art
performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference
time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized
scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses
that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions.
However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they
are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective
solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension.
ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a
parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty
rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based
LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks,
demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution
quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution
using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME
mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive
programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing
loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our
results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with
exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and
cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse
computational problems.

<details>

Motivation: BERTopic处理社交媒体数据易产生过多重叠主题，大语言模型用于主题建模计算开销大、可扩展性有限。

Method: 先使用BERTopic生成初始主题集并构建表征，再将表征输入大语言模型迭代合并语义相似主题。

Result: 在三个Twitter/X数据集和四个不同语言模型上评估，该方法在提升主题多样性和连贯性上优于基线方法，但受数据集特征和初始参数选择影响。

Conclusion: 所提结合BERTopic与大语言模型的框架在主题建模中有较好表现，但需考虑数据集和参数影响。

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical
clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While
effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy
and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work
explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling.
However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead,
limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a
framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language
models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics
and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then
provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and
merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three
Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms
the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases,
coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial
parameter selection.

Motivation: 现有嵌入越狱触发器的方法存在泛化性差、隐蔽性不足等问题，需更优方案。

Result: bi - GRPO 攻击成功率超 99%，在非触发场景保持隐蔽性，生成的越狱响应可用且连贯。

Conclusion: bi - GRPO 显著推动了越狱后门攻击的技术发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness
against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has
become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak
triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations
including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual
usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we
propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel
RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By
employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the
model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety
otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by
length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised
datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate),
preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and
coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in
jailbreak backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了可持续性监测方法，为开发高效极性检测系统提供见解。

Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally
recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and
economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification
of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in
many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of
this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,
neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of
SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates
progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such
progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark
dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and
synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six
state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned
configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the
current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly
QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable
Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with
synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this
task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in
addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work
advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides
actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity
detection systems.

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet
research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment
abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through
systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse
tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our
analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs'
sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a
self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers
as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between
generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these
skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in

open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence
in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3
semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such
as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The
results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when

Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning
show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named
entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world,
comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional
languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian
Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine
translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain
scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these
languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri,
Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence
pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into
three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware
machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To
demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future
research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models,
including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important
performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model
capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns
based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an
advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on
Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis,
offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.
By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability
of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable
resource for the machine translation research community.

Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT)
give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are
correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge
to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own
conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to
this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental
in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a
conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I
will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the
establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a
fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of
hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the
disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical
conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with
several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will
discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it
worse.

Conclusion: TP和IP对不同类型任务的性能预测有不同效果，LLMs语言支持存在深层次问题。

Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small
to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This
dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and
social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this
work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we
correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of
representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream
performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based
models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and
extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.
non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that
TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and
morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance
in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,
including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,
reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper
mismatches at the script or token level.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型因果关系分类，发现准确率近随机，表明因果理解失败源于缺乏结构化因果表征，而非预训练时因果示例接触不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在因果关系分类中准确率近随机的原因是预训练接触有限还是更深层次的表征差距。

Method: 在基于不确定性的评估下，用18K+PubMed句子对七个模型进行测试，通过因果分类和逐字记忆探测分析模型行为。

Result: 模型在见过和未见过的句子上准确率几乎相同，无记忆偏差，输出分布接近均匀，指令调优模型校准严重不佳，条件关系熵最高。

Conclusion: 因果理解失败源于缺乏结构化因果表征，而非预训练时因果示例接触不足。

Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation
classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from
limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate
this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure
to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half
from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models
(Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model
behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal
relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess
whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their
paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification
(direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals
and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on
seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original
selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat,
with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing.
Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence,
32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11%
vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise
from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient
exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于基准的评估方法依赖固定参考答案，难以捕捉生成响应的重要定性方面，需可靠评估方法确保大语言模型在实际场景的适用性。

Method: 提出SPEED框架，利用专业功能专家对模型输出进行全面、描述性分析，多维度纳入专家反馈。

Result: SPEED在不同领域和数据集上实现稳健一致的评估性能，使用较紧凑专家模型，资源效率优于大规模评估器。

Conclusion: SPEED显著提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可解释性，是现有评估方法的有前景替代方案。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their
applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation
methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to
capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these
shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called
\textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics},
SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive,
descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED
actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including
hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual
appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust
and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets.
Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates
superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These
findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and
interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to
existing evaluation methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在特定领域任务因训练数据问题表现受限，现有嵌入知识的方法如CPT和SFT存在局限性。

Method: 提出强化学习方法RLAG，在采样生成和通过计算奖励优化模型间迭代，选最高对数概率输出为采样结果，计算三个定制奖励指标引导优化。

Result: 在医学、法律、天文和时事数据集实验中，RLAG显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLAG有效嵌入关键且上下文连贯的领域知识，能提升大语言模型在特定领域任务的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on
domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of
specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these
datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain
applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into
models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT)
treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to
prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures
necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach
iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model
through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually
coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log
probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward
metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain
expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations
generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across
medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and
data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过添加思维轨迹提升大语言模型训练数据效率的方法TPT，实验表明该方法能显著提升模型性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型计算量增长快，但高质量数据有限，且固定模型容量下部分高质量标记难学习，需最大化可用数据效用。

Method: 提出Thinking augmented Pre - Training (TPT)方法，用自动生成的思维轨迹增强文本，增加训练数据量，通过逐步推理和分解使高质量标记更易学习，并在多种训练配置中应用。

Result: 方法显著提升不同大小和系列大语言模型的性能，将预训练数据效率提高3倍，在多个推理基准测试中使3B参数模型训练后性能提升超10%。

Conclusion: TPT方法能有效提高大语言模型训练的数据效率和性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data
efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text
data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been
growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data
remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data
constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that
certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model
capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally
complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented
Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with
automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively
increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more
learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across
diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training
with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong
open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method
substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and
families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a
factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training
performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 强调语言感知建模和可复现基准对缩小代表性不足语言性能差距的重要性。

Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages
like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including
limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of
standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning
techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality
for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach
that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding
initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment,
we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset
covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer
learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines,
with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation.
Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across
configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted
refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware
modeling and reproducible benchmarks in bridging the performance gap for
underrepresented languages. Resources are available at

Motivation: 探究机器翻译中充分性和流畅性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出在元评估中合成翻译系统的方法来控制偏差。

Result: 发现当前评估指标倾向充分性，元评估存在偏向充分性指标的情况，且部分原因是元评估数据集的系统构成。

Conclusion: 强调理解元评估中这种权衡及其对指标排名影响的重要性。

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine
translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and
analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics
generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more
strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly,
we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that
the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over
fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the
composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control
this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in
meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this
tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

Abstract: Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital
role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains
challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper
presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active
learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish,
German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our
results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional
baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy.
Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even
with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of
combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for
hope speech detection.

Motivation: 隐式思维链方法存在性能差距，训练过程不稳定限制了其应用，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出SIM - CoT，训练时用辅助解码器使隐式令牌与显式推理步骤对齐，推理时移除辅助解码器。

Result: 显著提升了多种隐式CoT方法的域内准确性和域外稳定性，如提升Coconut和CODI的性能，在GPT - 2上超越显式CoT基线。

Conclusion: SIM - CoT有效解决了隐式CoT方法的潜在不稳定问题，提升了性能且具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient
alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a
persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We
identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of
implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens
to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and
collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent
representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a
failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT
approaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training
module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the
latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder
during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit
reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful
information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,
preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added
overhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of
implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning
vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.
SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain
stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by
+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong
scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1%
with 2.3\times greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the
performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

TL;DR: 传统词级评估指标有局限，引入Z - Scores跨度级评估指标，可揭示模型弱点，助力模型改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词级评估指标如E - Scores无法揭示模型成败原因，需要更好的评估方法。

Method: 引入Z - Scores跨度级语言评估指标，通过确定性对齐模块映射生成文本和不流畅转录，对不同不流畅类型分类。

Result: Z - Scores能暴露词级指标掩盖的系统弱点，在大语言模型案例中揭示了INTJ和PRN不流畅性挑战。

Conclusion: Z - Scores可让研究人员识别模型失败模式，设计针对性干预措施，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate
token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models
succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded
evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency
types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust
mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to
expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing
category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model
failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or
data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study
with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies
hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.

Motivation: 话语不流畅性对语音驱动系统造成挑战，降低了准确性，因此需要一个基准来评估去除不流畅性的效果。

Method: 构建DRES基准，基于人工标注的Switchboard转录，评估不同规模、提示策略和架构的专有和开源大语言模型。

Result: 简单分割能提升性能；推理型模型易过度删除流畅标记；微调可接近最优指标但损害泛化能力。还发现特定错误模式。

Conclusion: DRES为推进稳健的口语语言系统提供了可复现、与模型无关的基础，并给出九条实用建议。

Abstract: Disfluencies -- such as "um," "uh," interjections, parentheticals, and edited
statements -- remain a persistent challenge for speech-driven systems,
degrading accuracy in command interpretation, summarization, and conversational
agents. We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled
text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for
this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating
disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically
evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies,
and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently
improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented
models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near
state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We
further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical
recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven
pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for
advancing robust spoken-language systems.

Abstract: Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It
serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,
and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development
during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical
language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity
documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary
sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,
and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich
inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed
and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,
corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based
Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words
according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample
verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the
system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline
model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system
considering morphological variations of the language.

generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.
Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,

results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,
with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models
double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,
this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding
outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and
high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation

Method: 受计算化学中SMILES表示法启发，开发UCCSD量子算符的文本表示方法，探索算符文本模式相似性，利用文本相似度指标建立迁移学习框架。

Result: 在GQE范式下，所提方法结合简单基线设置实现了不同分子系统间基态能量计算的知识迁移。

Conclusion: 该发现有利于混合量子 - 经典计算分子基态能量，大幅降低计算资源需求。

Abstract: Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum
Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into
hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum
Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking
the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is
widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems
require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity
of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the
similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the
SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a
text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging
the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems.
This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and
employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our
approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between
different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE
paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid
quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially
reducing computational resource requirements.

Conclusion: 通过将物理知识嵌入学习过程，Refgen可有效解决制冷剂发现中数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as
hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down.
Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for
alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a
few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation.
This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven
methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine
learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for
valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical
properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor
compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning
fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding
discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental
impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce
data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set

Motivation: einsum虽实用但缺乏理论基础且各框架不统一，限制形式推理和系统优化。

Method: 讨论张量表达式术语，给出einsum语言形式化定义。

Result: 形式化并证明了张量表达式重要等价规则。

Conclusion: 所提定义和证明的规则对实际应用有重要意义。

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient
notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit
simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional
Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other
programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum
notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the
different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and
systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor
expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on
this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor
expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能合约形式验证工具学习曲线陡峭、规范语言受限，大语言模型用于安全任务的能力待明确，需评估其能否作为验证预言机。

Method: 在大量验证任务数据集上对GPT - 5进行基准测试，将其输出与现有形式验证工具对比，结合定量指标和定性分析评估其在实际审计场景中的有效性。

Result: 近期推理型大语言模型作为验证预言机有惊人效果。

Conclusion: 为安全智能合约开发和审计中人工智能与形式方法的融合开辟了新领域。

Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws
can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot
common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most
real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic.
Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this
challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and
restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use
of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as
vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question
remains open: can LLMs serve as verification oracles, capable of reasoning
about arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the
first systematic evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this
role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks,
compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and
assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study
combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent
reasoning-oriented LLMs can be surprisingly effective as verification oracles,
suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for
secure smart contract development and auditing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居物联网设备增长使用户面临安全风险，用户获取安全信息复杂，威胁智能家居安全，需解决用户层面安全问题。

Method: 从公共论坛构建问答数据集，用LDA提取安全关注点，微调T5和Flan - T5等小模型搭建问答系统，手动整理数据集并补充合成数据。

Result: 该方法显著提高系统给出准确相关答案的能力，实验表明提升了基础模型性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有助于用户解决智能家居物联网设备常见安全问题，小模型更适合智能家居环境。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of smart home IoT devices, users are increasingly
exposed to various security risks, as evident from recent studies. While
seeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left
with their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online
blogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular
users trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go
along with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the
security of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and
address the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we
develop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security
challenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in
smart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA). We fine-tune relatively "smaller" transformer models, such as T5 and
Flan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security.
Unlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource
hungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for
deployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart
homes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to
explore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly
improves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping
users address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices. Our
experiments on real-world user concerns show that our work improves the
performance of the base models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 文章指出当前Poison - only Clean - label Backdoor Attacks方法在样本选择和触发器处理上的不足，提出一组组件来提升攻击成功率和隐蔽性，且组件可集成到多种攻击中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在样本选择和触发器处理上孤立，简单组合无法有效提升攻击成功率和隐蔽性，且缺乏通用性，因此要探索两者双向协作关系并基于攻击共性提出组件。

Method: 提出组件A确定关键选择因素并结合触发器规模选样本；组件B选与触发器植入样本相似的样本；组件C根据人眼对RGB敏感度重新分配触发器中毒强度。

Result: 未提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 提出的组件可显著提升攻击的隐蔽性和成功率，且能集成到多种Poison - only Clean - label Backdoor Attacks中。

Abstract: Poison-only Clean-label Backdoor Attacks aim to covertly inject
attacker-desired behavior into DNNs by merely poisoning the dataset without
changing the labels. To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple
\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack
Success Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances
clean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples
instead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the
sample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited
improvements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit
unsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a
mere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional
collaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address
the above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple
combination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance
both evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks.
Therefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both
stealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically,
Component A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an
appropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable
``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples
with similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote
stealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors
through distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR,
with stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B.
Furthermore, all components can be strategically integrated into diverse PCBAs.

Method: 引入CyberSOCEval套件，针对恶意软件分析和威胁情报推理两个任务评估大语言模型。

Result: 更大、更现代的大语言模型表现更好，推理模型未像在编码和数学中那样提升，当前模型远未饱和评估。

Conclusion: CyberSOCEval为AI开发者提升网络防御能力带来挑战和改进机会。

Abstract: Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts,
threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent
need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations
Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios
most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts
both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear
insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack
a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most
effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber
attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and
community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address
this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within
CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in
two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive
domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show
that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training
scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time
scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these
models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and
pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far
from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a
significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.

Motivation: 现代汽车开发中安全测试至关重要，从攻击树生成测试用例劳动密集且易出错，自动化程度有限。

Result: 在效率、准确性、可扩展性和工作流集成方面有显著改善。

Conclusion: STAF框架推动了汽车安全测试方法自动化的重大进步，通过TARAs做验证测试输入，实现了安全汽车开发过程两个关键元素的协同。

Abstract: In modern automotive development, security testing is critical for
safeguarding systems against increasingly advanced threats. Attack trees are
widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but
generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive,
error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing
vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation
Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation.
Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation
of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end
solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the
elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible
and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with
an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with
general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely
GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our
operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant
improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any
workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security
testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create
synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development
process.

Result: 发现所有已识别的软件供应链相关威胁持续存在。

Conclusion: 提出基于提示的Chain-of-Confirmation防御机制减少编造问题，以及基于中间件的防御机制告知用户威胁。

Abstract: In recent years, various software supply chain (SSC) attacks have posed
significant risks to the global community. Severe consequences may arise if
developers integrate insecure code snippets that are vulnerable to SSC attacks
into their products. Particularly, code generation techniques, such as large
language models (LLMs), have been widely utilized in the developer community.
However, LLMs are known to suffer from inherent issues when generating code,
including fabrication, misinformation, and reliance on outdated training data,
all of which can result in serious software supply chain threats. In this
paper, we investigate the security threats to the SSC that arise from these
inherent issues. We examine three categories of threats, including eleven
potential SSC-related threats, related to external components in source code,
and continuous integration configuration files. We find some threats in
LLM-generated code could enable attackers to hijack software and workflows,
while some others might cause potential hidden threats that compromise the
security of the software over time. To understand these security impacts and
severity, we design a tool, SSCGuard, to generate 439,138 prompts based on
SSC-related questions collected online, and analyze the responses of four
popular LLMs from GPT and Llama. Our results show that all identified
SSC-related threats persistently exist. To mitigate these risks, we propose a
novel prompt-based defense mechanism, namely Chain-of-Confirmation, to reduce
fabrication, and a middleware-based defense that informs users of various SSC
threats.

Result: 建立了正式定义和攻击模型。

Conclusion: 为更严谨、有原则地理解RAG系统的隐私和安全奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural
language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external
document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses. While RAG
has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual
consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ
from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that
LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or
adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At
the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack
surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or
content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to
manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal
framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we
address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We
introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to
model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as
document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious
privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal
definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous
and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 混合自适应模型选择策略有潜力在不显著影响准确率的情况下降低现代 AI 系统能耗。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is increasingly pervasive across domains, with ever
more complex models delivering impressive predictive performance. This fast
technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost,
with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large
language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In
this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an
approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the
environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while
minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into
account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available
models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable
model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic
model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on
a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection
can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially
retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As
conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid,
adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of
modern AI systems without significantly compromising accuracy requirements.

capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to
recognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research
that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study
analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial
expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable
emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional
experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between
explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings
and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions.
That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and
individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The
paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare,
education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural
variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition
systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the
paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act
frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive
personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation,
data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.

Abstract: This study constructs a fully data-driven and reproducible Southeast Asia
Influence Index (SAII v3) to reduce bias from expert scoring and subjective

nations. We aggregate authoritative open-source indicators across four
dimensions (economic, military, diplomatic, socio-technological) and apply a
three-tiered standardization chain quantile-Box-Cox-min-max to mitigate
outliers and skewness. Weights are obtained through equal-weight integration of
Entropy Weighting Method (EWM), CRITIC, and PCA. Robustness is assessed via
Kendall's tau, +/-20% weight perturbation, and 10,000 bootstrap iterations,
with additional checks including +/-10% dimensional sensitivity and V2-V3 bump
chart comparisons. Results show integrated weights: Economy 35-40%, Military
20-25%, Diplomacy about 20%, Socio-Technology about 15%. The regional landscape
exhibits a one-strong, two-medium, three-stable, and multiple-weak pattern:
Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia lead, while Thailand, the Philippines, and
Vietnam form a mid-tier competitive band. V2 and V3 rankings are highly
consistent (Kendall's tau = 0.818), though small mid-tier reorderings appear
(Thailand and the Philippines rise, Vietnam falls), indicating that v3 is more
sensitive to structural equilibrium. ASEAN-11 average sensitivity highlights
military and socio-technological dimensions as having the largest marginal
effects (+/-0.002). In conclusion, SAII v3 delivers algorithmic weighting and
auditable reproducibility, reveals multidimensional drivers of influence in
Southeast Asia, and provides actionable quantitative evidence for resource
allocation and policy prioritization by regional governments and external
partners.

Result: PINNs所需人力和专业知识少，但传统方法表现更优，高维和数据增多时差距减小。

Conclusion: 若要提升PINNs在含噪逆问题上的竞争力，需解决训练中的常见失败问题。

Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is
fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering.
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based
approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are
widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as
the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy.
However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems
and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in
solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite
element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a
series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without
noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized
knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the
difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We
identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of
PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular
dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their
predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease
gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models
trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known
pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks
model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently
considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the
burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.

Result: 发现DQI有非平凡近似保证的MaxCut实例可在经典多项式时间内精确求解。

Conclusion: DQI在MaxCut问题上有其独特特性，且可通过初等图论进行简化解释。

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a framework for approximating special
kinds of discrete optimization problems that relies on problem structure in a
way that sets it apart from other classical or quantum approaches. We show that
the instances of MaxCut on which DQI attains a nontrivial asymptotic
approximation guarantee are solvable exactly in classical polynomial time. We
include a streamlined exposition of DQI tailored for MaxCut that relies on
elementary graph theory instead of coding theory to motivate and explain the
algorithm.

### [287] [Dequantization and Hardness of Spectral Sum Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20183)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文给出矩阵谱和估计的新去量子化与复杂度结果，包括经典算法改进、DQC1 - 完备性结果及BQP - 困难性与PP - 完备性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对矩阵谱和（如对数行列式）估计，改进经典算法并研究其复杂度，解决相关公开问题。

Method: 对量子算法进行去量子化，分析不同输入模型下的复杂度，得出DQC1 - 完备性、BQP - 困难性和PP - 完备性结果。

Result: 提出经典算法时间复杂度为polylog(N)⋅s^O(√κlogκ/ε)，在特定参数下有指数级改进；证明特定谱和估计的DQC1 - 完备性；得到高精度对数行列式估计的BQP - 困难性和PP - 完备性结果。

Conclusion: 给出矩阵谱和估计的一系列复杂度结果，解决部分公开问题。

Abstract: We give new dequantization and hardness results for estimating spectral sums
of matrices, such as the log-determinant. Recent quantum algorithms have
demonstrated that the logarithm of the determinant of sparse, well-conditioned,
positive matrices can be approximated to $\varepsilon$-relative accuracy in
time polylogarithmic in the dimension $N$, specifically in time
$\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{log}(N), s, \kappa, 1/\varepsilon)$, where $s$ is the
sparsity and $\kappa$ the condition number of the input matrix. We provide a
simple dequantization of these techniques that preserves the polylogarithmic
dependence on the dimension. Our classical algorithm runs in time
$\mathrm{polylog}(N)\cdot s^{O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log \kappa/\varepsilon)}$ which
constitutes an exponential improvement over previous classical algorithms in
certain parameter regimes.
  We complement our classical upper bound with $\mathsf{DQC1}$-completeness
results for estimating specific spectral sums such as the trace of the inverse
and the trace of matrix powers for log-local Hamiltonians, with parameter
scalings analogous to those of known quantum algorithms. Assuming
$\mathsf{BPP}\subsetneq\mathsf{DQC1}$, this rules out classical algorithms with
the same scalings. It also resolves a main open problem of Cade and Montanaro
(TQC 2018) concerning the complexity of Schatten-$p$ norm estimation. We
further analyze a block-encoding input model, where instead of a classical
description of a sparse matrix, we are given a block-encoding of it. We show
$\mathsf{DQC}1$-completeness in a very general way in this model for estimating
$\mathrm{tr}[f(A)]$ whenever $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are sufficiently smooth.
  We conclude our work with $\mathsf{BQP}$-hardness and
$\mathsf{PP}$-completeness results for high-accuracy log-determinant
estimation.

Motivation: 研究原用于相干光通信系统的DSP技术在CV - QKD中的应用，推动CV - QKD性能提升，对该新兴领域进行全面可重复的综合研究。

Method: 采用APISSER方法，在IEEE Xplore和Web of Science数据库（2021 - 2025）进行结构化搜索，对220篇相关文献筛选、分类和分析以回答六个研究问题。

Result: 许多经典DSP算法成功应用于量子领域，还发现相干光通信系统中一些有潜力用于CV - QKD的创新技术。

Conclusion: 虽然取得进展，但在超低信噪比下相位跟踪、实时偏振补偿和与经典信道安全共存方面存在挑战，该综述为CV - QKD系统发展提供支持。

Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal
processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical
communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).
The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD
performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and
excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis
of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented
framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE
Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant
publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six
research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms,
such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and
machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to
the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise
constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent
optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD
integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint
retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in
achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with
classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and
emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and
classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient
CV-QKD systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序合成等专业领域，HDL和专有EDA资源相对稀缺，带来任务特定微调、高推理成本和手动编排智能体等挑战。

Method: 提出VeriMaAS多智能体框架，将HDL工具的形式验证反馈直接集成到工作流生成中。

Result: 相比微调基线，合成性能在pass@k上提高5 - 7%，仅需几百个训练示例，监督成本降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: VeriMaAS框架有效提升了RTL代码生成的合成性能，同时显著降低了监督成本。

Abstract: The rise of agentic AI workflows unlocks novel opportunities for computer
systems design and optimization. However, for specialized domains such as
program synthesis, the relative scarcity of HDL and proprietary EDA resources
online compared to more common programming tasks introduces challenges, often
necessitating task-specific fine-tuning, high inference costs, and
manually-crafted agent orchestration. In this work, we present VeriMaAS, a
multi-agent framework designed to automatically compose agentic workflows for
RTL code generation. Our key insight is to integrate formal verification
feedback from HDL tools directly into workflow generation, reducing the cost of
gradient-based updates or prolonged reasoning traces. Our method improves
synthesis performance by 5-7% for pass@k over fine-tuned baselines, while
requiring only a few hundred training examples, representing an
order-of-magnitude reduction in supervision cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能移动应用需求增加，在移动边缘计算网络中训练大语言模型面临计算量大、端到端延迟高和模型泛化受限等挑战。

Method: 提出CollaPipe框架，将编码器分区到移动设备进行管道并行训练，解码器部署在边缘服务器；通过联合优化问题自适应分配资源；设计基于Lyapunov优化的DSSDA算法。

Result: 在Transformer和BERT模型下游任务实验中，CollaPipe提升计算效率达15.09%，降低端到端延迟至少48.98%，单设备内存使用减半以上。

Conclusion: CollaPipe能在异构和动态通信环境中实现在线学习，提高训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent mobile applications has made
multi-agent collaboration with Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
essential in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, training LLMs in
such environments remains challenging due to heavy computation, high end-to-end
latency, and limited model generalization. We introduce CollaPipe, a hybrid
distributed learning framework that integrates collaborative pipeline
parallelism with federated aggregation to support self-evolving intelligent
networks. In CollaPipe, the encoder part is adaptively partitioned into
variable-sized segments and deployed across mobile devices for
pipeline-parallel training, while the decoder is deployed on edge servers to
handle generative tasks. Then we perform global model update via federated
aggregation. To enhance training efficiency, we formulate a joint optimization
problem that adaptively allocates model segments, micro-batches, bandwidth, and
transmission power. We derive and use a closed-form convergence bound to design
an Dynamic Segment Scheduling and Resource Allocation (DSSDA) algorithm based
on Lyapunov optimization, ensuring system stability under long-term
constraints. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks with Transformer and
BERT models show that CollaPipe improves computation efficiency by up to
15.09%, reduces end-to-end latency by at least 48.98%, and cuts single device
memory usage by more than half, enabling online learning in heterogeneous and
dynamic communication environments.

Motivation: 标准深度学习模型在下游控制中难以执行物理结构或保持凸性，导致物理不一致预测和不连续输入。

Method: 引入统一单调性、正性和符号确定性的符号约束，开发执行约束的模型构建方法和控制综合程序，设计满足约束的可线性化深度模型，将模型预测控制公式化为凸二次规划。

Result: 在双水箱系统和混合动力总成上，该方法提高了预测精度，产生了比现有方法更平滑的控制输入。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在解决深度学习模型物理结构和凸性问题上有良好效果，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where
first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models
often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream
control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous
inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions
on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and
sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that
enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we
design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and
formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields
a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system
and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and
produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.

Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法基于时间触发执行，计算和通信成本高，需改进。

Method: 提出ET - MAPG框架联合学习智能体控制策略和事件触发策略；引入AET - MAPG利用自注意力机制学习选择性通信模式，二者可与任意策略梯度MARL算法集成。

Result: 在多种MARL基准测试中，所提方法性能与现有时间触发基线相当，同时显著降低计算负载和通信开销。

Conclusion: 所提ET - MAPG和AET - MAPG框架有效，能在降低成本的情况下达到较好性能。

Abstract: Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on
time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed
intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and
communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG
(Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a
framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its
event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms,
ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to
learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios
with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based
variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective
communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to
trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to
exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with
any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL
benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to
state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both
computational load and communication overhead.

Abstract: In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the
smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools
from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators
corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space
$M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples
on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting
in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction
algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.

Motivation: 自动音乐刻谱在符号音乐处理中未被充分探索，但对有人参与的音乐应用至关重要。

Method: 将问题形式化为相互依赖的子任务集合，使用多任务图神经网络共同预测多个刻谱要素，并用后处理流程生成输出。

Result: 在两个不同钢琴语料库上的综合评估显示，统一模型在所有子任务上都达到了良好的准确率。

Conclusion: 多任务设置下共享GNN编码器和轻量级特定任务解码器为自动音乐刻谱提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on automatic music engraving, i.e., the creation of a
humanly-readable musical score from musical content. This step is fundamental
for all applications that include a human player, but it remains a mostly
unexplored topic in symbolic music processing. In this work, we formalize the
problem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph
neural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and
quantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly
predict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature,
stem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing
pipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation
on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our
unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing
systems that only specialize in specific subtasks. These results indicate that
a shared GNN encoder with lightweight task-specific decoders in a multi-task
setting offers a scalable and effective solution for automatic music engraving.

Result: 在非截肢者上保持有竞争力表现，在截肢者上达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: AJAHR框架和A3D数据集能有效改善截肢者的网格重建。

Abstract: Existing human mesh recovery methods assume a standard human body structure,
overlooking diverse anatomical conditions such as limb loss. This assumption
introduces bias when applied to individuals with amputations - a limitation
further exacerbated by the scarcity of suitable datasets. To address this gap,
we propose Amputated Joint Aware 3D Human Mesh Recovery (AJAHR), which is an
adaptive pose estimation framework that improves mesh reconstruction for
individuals with limb loss. Our model integrates a body-part amputation
classifier, jointly trained with the mesh recovery network, to detect potential
amputations. We also introduce Amputee 3D (A3D), which is a synthetic dataset
offering a wide range of amputee poses for robust training. While maintaining
competitive performance on non-amputees, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results for amputated individuals. Additional materials can be found at the

Result: 在HDTF和VoxCeleb上实验表明KSDiff达到了最先进水平，提升了唇同步准确性和头部姿态自然度。

Conclusion: 结合语音解缠和关键帧感知扩散对生成会说话头部有效。

Abstract: Audio-driven facial animation has made significant progress in multimedia
applications, with diffusion models showing strong potential for talking-face
synthesis. However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic
representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving
different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling
keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose
KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework.
Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech
Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related
features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module
predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a
Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions.
Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization
accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head
generation.

Method: 以提格雷尼亚语和阿姆哈拉语为研究对象，评估健康查询搜索结果的常见特征、信息质量和可信度以及与查询的差异。

Result: 低网络数据语言健康查询结果可能非搜索语言，受营养和宗教建议主导；结果与查询不符是算法失败、（非）有意操纵或内容创作者主动操纵所致。

Conclusion: 展示了数据边界在多种信息可用性约束下的表现。

Abstract: Data voids--areas of the internet where reliable information is scarce or
absent--pose significant challenges to online health information seeking,
particularly for users operating in low-web data languages. These voids are
increasingly encountered not on traditional search engines alone, but on social
media platforms, which have gradually morphed into informal search engines for
millions of people. In this paper, we introduce the phenomenon of data
horizons: a critical boundary where algorithmic structures begin to degrade the
relevance and reliability of search results. Unlike the core of a data void,
which is often exploited by bad actors to spread misinformation, the data
horizon marks the critical space where systemic factors, such as linguistic
underrepresentation, algorithmic amplification, and socio-cultural mismatch,
create conditions of informational instability. Focusing on Tigrinya and
Amharic as languages of study, we evaluate (1) the common characteristics of
search results for health queries, (2) the quality and credibility of health
information, and (3) characteristics of search results that diverge from their
queries. We find that search results for health queries in low-web data
languages may not always be in the language of search and may be dominated by
nutritional and religious advice. We show that search results that diverge from
their queries in low-resourced languages are due to algorithmic failures,
(un)intentional manipulation, or active manipulation by content creators. We
use our findings to illustrate how a data horizon manifests under several
interacting constraints on information availability.

Method: 进行纵向研究，183名参与者随机分为与聊天机器人对话组和玩文字游戏组，连续21天每天10分钟，期间完成四次调查和两次访谈。

Result: 与对照组相比，21天与聊天机器人互动未显著影响社交健康和人际关系；社交需求高的人更易拟人化机器人，拟人化程度高者认为人机互动对其与亲友社交影响更大。

Conclusion: 人机互动对人际社交结果的影响由人们对AI的拟人化程度介导，而拟人化程度与社交连接欲望有关。

Abstract: Relationships with social artificial intelligence (AI) agents are on the
rise. People report forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships
with chatbots such as Replika, a type of social AI agent that is designed
specifically for companionship. Concerns that companion chatbot relationships
may harm or replace human ones have been raised, but whether and how these
social consequences occur remains unclear. Prior research suggests that
people's states of social need and their anthropomorphism of the AI agent may
play a role in how human-AI interaction impacts human-human interaction. In
this longitudinal study (N = 183), participants were randomly assigned to
converse with a companion chatbot over text or to play text-based word games
for 10 minutes a day for 21 consecutive days. During these 21 days,
participants also completed four surveys and two audio-recorded interviews. We
found that people's social health and relationships were not significantly
impacted by interacting with a companion chatbot across 21 days compared to the
control group. However, people who had a higher desire to socially connect
anthropomorphized the chatbot more. Those who anthropomorphized the chatbot
more indicated that the human-chatbot interaction had greater impacts on their
social interactions and relationships with family and friends. A mediation
analysis suggested that the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human
social outcomes was mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphized
the AI agent, which itself was related to the desire to socially connect.

Conclusion: 研究为推进AI对齐和安全开辟了参与式路径。

Abstract: As LLMs gain adoption in high-stakes domains like mental health, domain
experts are increasingly consulted to provide input into policies governing
their behavior. From an observation of 19 policymaking workshops with 9 experts
over 15 weeks, we identified opportunities to better support rapid
experimentation, feedback, and iteration for collaborative policy design
processes. We present PolicyPad, an interactive system that facilitates the
emerging practice of LLM policy prototyping by drawing from established UX
prototyping practices, including heuristic evaluation and storyboarding. Using
PolicyPad, policy designers can collaborate on drafting a policy in real time
while independently testing policy-informed model behavior with usage
scenarios. We evaluate PolicyPad through workshops with 8 groups of 22 domain
experts in mental health and law, finding that PolicyPad enhanced collaborative
dynamics during policy design, enabled tight feedback loops, and led to novel
policy contributions. Overall, our work paves participatory paths for advancing
AI alignment and safety.

case study on how people build and explore personal knowledge bases for various
purposes. We selected the note-taking tool Obsidian and researchers from a
Brazilian lab for an in-depth investigation. Our investigation reveals
interesting findings about how researchers build and explore their personal
knowledge bases. A key finding is that participants' knowledge retrieval
strategy influences how they build and maintain their content. We suggest
potential features for an AI system to support this process.

Motivation: 研究采用低精度ADC的ARIS辅助NOMA系统的性能，考虑RHIs和ipSIC的影响。

Method: 推导OP的解析近似，分析高SNR下的渐近OP、系统吞吐量和分集阶数，进行仿真验证。

Result: 提出的量化ARIS - NOMA系统优于被动PRIS - NOMA系统，增加反射元件可改善 outage性能，优化发射功率和反射元件数量可减轻低精度ADC负面影响。

Conclusion: 量化ARIS - NOMA系统在性能上有优势，可通过优化参数提升性能。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent
surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing
low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations
for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware
impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC).
Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity
order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive
counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced
transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage
performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates
significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The
negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by
optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.

Conclusion: 基于Arduino Mega 2560的低成本多传感器平台结合机器学习和特征工程，可实现有机物可靠识别和质量控制。

Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive
classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard
Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial
environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated
in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired
samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and
cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup,
resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was
employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After
preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised
learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT),
and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were
trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing
models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test
accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that
low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with
advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable
reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.

*Antonio Quintero Rincon,Nicolas Masino,Veronica Marsico,Hadj Batatia*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出轻量级混合管道用于长期单极EEG中准确、患者特定的SWD检测，效果良好且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动识别多日记录中的SWD劳动强度大且易出错，需要自动化检测方法。

Method: 采用双边移动平均滤波器抑制背景活动高频成分，用均值和标准差总结残差信号得到特征向量，输入单隐藏层ANN进行分类。

Result: 在780个通道上评估，正确检测384个事件，灵敏度98%，特异性96.2%，总体准确率97.2%，可实时运行且无需手动调阈值。

Conclusion: 正态分布描述符与适度ANN结合为扩展EEG记录中的SWD自动筛查提供了有效且计算成本低的解决方案。

Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of
absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings
remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid
pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural
network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term,
monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the
high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is
then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally
distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for
every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained
via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was
evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392
annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while
achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because
feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs
in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate
that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an
effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening
in extended EEG recordings.

Conclusion: NS - KTR能保留张量各维度结构特征并确保物理解释性，适用于信号处理和高光谱图像分析。

Abstract: This paper introduces Generalized Nonnegative Structured Kruskal Tensor
Regression (NS-KTR), a novel tensor regression framework that enhances
interpretability and performance through mode-specific hybrid regularization
and nonnegativity constraints. Our approach accommodates both linear and
logistic regression formulations for diverse response variables while
addressing the structural heterogeneity inherent in multidimensional tensor
data. We integrate fused LASSO, total variation, and ridge regularizers, each
tailored to specific tensor modes, and develop an efficient alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm for parameter
estimation. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic signals and real
hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that NS-KTR consistently outperforms
conventional tensor regression methods. The framework's ability to preserve
distinct structural characteristics across tensor dimensions while ensuring
physical interpretability makes it especially suitable for applications in
signal processing and hyperspectral image analysis.

Conclusion: 所提出的通过在线学习优化异构无线网络中联邦微调的方法有效，能提升性能。

Abstract: Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency
and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning
mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless
networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices
pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these
issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless
networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated
fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA
modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly
mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability.
Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on
theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a
non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and
decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth
allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve
the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation
results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in
test accuracy and energy efficiency.

*Minghui Wu,Zhen Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出端到端上下行 CSI 融合预编码网络解决大规模 MIMO 高维下行 CSI 问题，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模 MIMO 带来高维下行 CSI，使实时信道获取和预编码复杂，需解决此问题。

Method: 构建基于 MAXIM 架构的投影网络设计下行 CSI - RS，UE 压缩反馈，基站两个分支产生候选预编码器后由融合网络组合，各模块按三阶段调度用面向频谱效率的损失函数训练。

Result: 仿真表明该方法能有效利用 SRS 信息和 UE 反馈。

Conclusion: 提出的方法性能明显优于传统基线。

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral
efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state
information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and
precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI
fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal
(CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single
E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM
architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs
frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink
CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS
observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS),
two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only
precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is
an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders
are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final
transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a
spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived
information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than
conventional baselines.

Motivation: 儿科心律失常自动分类因类别不平衡、少样本类别和复杂信号特征存在挑战，限制早期筛查和临床干预效率与可靠性。

Conclusion: 框架显著提高少数心律失常类别的可检测性和鲁棒性，对儿科和先天性心脏病群体有临床价值。

Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden
cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to
class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which
severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical
intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep
learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and
IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight
Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a
new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive
Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability
through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center
pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and
reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset,
including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro
Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64,
+15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in
Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the
framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority
arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening,
pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and
congenital heart disease populations.

TL;DR: 本文首次实现仅用ECG进行六种不同活动的稳健识别，设计评估三种深度学习模型，取得高准确率，为下一代可穿戴设备发展提供潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于惯性测量单元的活动识别资源消耗大且需校准，基于ECG的方法有局限，需推进仅用ECG进行活动识别的研究。

Method: 设计并评估三种深度学习模型，包括带Squeeze - and - Excitation块的CNN分类器、带扩张卷积的ResNet分类器和CNNTransformer混合模型。

Conclusion: 首次成功实现仅用ECG进行多种身体活动分类，为开发同时具备心脏监测和活动识别功能的下一代可穿戴设备提供了重要潜力。

Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early
intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on
inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require
calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored,
these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to
broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive
in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for
the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct
activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate
three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with
Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet
classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency
capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature
extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship
modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models
achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid
reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be
further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates
the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical
activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation
wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition
without additional motion sensors.

Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant
attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human
neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches.
However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the
absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and
transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion
regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable
scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified
evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations
of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data
preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework
enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets
across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at:

Conclusion: 在注意力中引入物理一致性可提升复值学习效果，为相干信号建模提供统一物理框架。

Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models
treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects.
We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that
incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic
attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes
values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder
simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing
phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that
holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains
phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image
classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance,
achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and
increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that
enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements
in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for
coherent signal modeling. The code is available at

Abstract: ISAC is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication
systems, enabling simultaneous data transmission and target sensing. Among
various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the
full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving
and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either
waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes,
leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited
sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework
that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base
station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components:
anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization.
First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection
problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired
by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization
algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters.
Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we
design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations,
enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI
characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to
enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed
framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or
signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing
communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method
can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy
with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and
estimation errors.

Abstract: With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the
capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in
spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for
mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC
offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe
challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port
configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem.
Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed
Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating
information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA
channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional
optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port
selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a
game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA)
based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples
and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base
station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality
of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents
to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the
proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading
performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel
estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port
densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: AUWave为填补数据空白、数据同化和应急重建提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from
sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean
monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep
learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a
multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover
32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search
with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of
generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using
NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave
attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE
distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase
with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling.
Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a
representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is
only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The
architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy
gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps
and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately
degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave
provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data
assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

Conclusion: 直接隐空间对齐用于单导联心电图检测心肌梗死有效。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease,
yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging
due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead
into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative
methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space
gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the
question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG
alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches
the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a
simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial
infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data
augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead
ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in
the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing
transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation,
explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation
capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal.
Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models
across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler
architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the
efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be
publicly available after acceptance.

Motivation: 脑电信号个体差异阻碍脑机接口系统在线应用，需克服该局限。

Method: 在脑电数据空间进行欧几里得对齐，更新表征空间的批量归一化统计量；设计自监督损失更新解码器，用解码器的软伪标签计算损失并通过香农熵校准。

Result: 在五个公共数据集和七个解码器上实验，算法能无缝集成，每次迭代用单条在线试验更新解码器，稳态视觉诱发电位平均准确率提高4.9%，运动想象提高3.6%。

Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To
overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm
for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The
alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space
and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space.
Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is
computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the
unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate
self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven
decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of
BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is
updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9%
on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery.
These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed
algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.

Conclusion: FHNet展示了人工智能驱动建模在胎儿监测和早期先天性心脏病筛查的潜力，凸显下一代生物医学信号处理变革性影响。

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly,
highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet,
fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal
ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework
that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer
to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean
fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long
short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art
models, achieving R2>0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise.
Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and
lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet
illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and
enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of
next-generation biomedical signal processing.

Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their
adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as
a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy
density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness.
The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave
Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt
changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise
interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur
extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study
proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits
the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims
to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and
address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby
achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height.
Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047
spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single
models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved
significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and
suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE
reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation
experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component
step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter
recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making
for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the
power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the
charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall
electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered
part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution
Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence
in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better
plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper
addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive
manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach
based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior
knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data
of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal
convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power
consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE
shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.

Conclusion: 构建的网络生成的虚拟EEG信号与真实信号一致性高，能显著提升焦虑分类机器学习算法性能，有效缓解少通道便携式EEG设备信息采集不足问题。

Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information
collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel
signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion
strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network
aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain
regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional
neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial
domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public
PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects,
was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the
average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG
signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute
error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined
with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety
classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the
virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high
degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly
enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety
classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient
information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.

Result: 在真实MR数据集上实验，框架在定位和信道建模方面有优越性能与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提基于MR数据驱动的LSCM框架有效可行，能解决现有方法的问题。

Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective
performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely
relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to
model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the
channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on
drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In
this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for
LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The
framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the
issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method
based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via
distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location
extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness,
LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing
geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid
construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex
environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation.
This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using
clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement
matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a
real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness
of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model
based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly
electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption
data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and
demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a
mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of
0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved
crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing
the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and
hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary
analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest
regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii)
an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand
maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the
test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results
highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the
proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking
optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.

Result: 在可控MIMO实验中有效抑制三阶PIM失真，仅11k可训练参数下平均功率误差达29dB。

Conclusion: 紧凑神经架构在未来无线通信系统可扩展干扰缓解方面有潜力。

Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of
self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent
requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on
complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost.
In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM
cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated
convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and
subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate
schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the
method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM)
distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k
trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural
architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless
communication systems.

Conclusion: MoE框架在EEG处理的EMG伪影去除方面有前景，需更多研究评估其在更多真实场景的效果和下游潜力。

Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality.
While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for
electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high
noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based
denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new
statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can
be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification,
(2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can
achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based
objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable
faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically
demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings
to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional
(CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major
benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our
MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML
denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise
settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework
for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in
high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to
assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore
its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.

Conclusion: 首次将自监督学习应用于P300拼写器，为提升拼写器BCI效率和泛化性、构建EEG基础模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor
generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a
framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to
address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance
SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D
U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG
data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight
ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned
representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time
demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly
reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across
subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG
representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a
state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and
the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public
II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the
required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character
recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both
efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG
foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.

Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is
a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are
designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC,

architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives,
leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such
trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high

Abstract: Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical
learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer
efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but
they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification
problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual
formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and
efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its
translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a
central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields
improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant
quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the
same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter
regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the
perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study
on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational
efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming
them in accuracy.

Conclusion: 研发和资本市场虽能通过创业促进创新，但不足以推动发展中国家经济增长，为中等收入陷阱提供进一步证据。

Abstract: The goal of this research is to uncover the channels through which research
and development (R&D) impacts economic growth in developing countries. The
study employed nine variables from three broader categories in the World
Economic Forum database, each covering 32 countries from the
lower-middle-income group for the year 2019. The theoretical framework is based
on the R&D ecosystem, which includes components such as Institutions, Human
capital, Capital market, R&D, and Innovation. Each of these components can
contribute to the economic development of the country. Using Structural
Equation Modelling (SEM), we build a path diagram to visualize and confirm a
potential relationship between the components. R&D features had a positive
impact on innovation (regression weight estimate: +0.34, p = 0.001), as did
capital market institutions (regression weight estimate: +0.12, p = 0.007), but
neither had a significant impact on growth. According to the Schumpeterian
institutional interpretation, R&D and innovation efforts may not lead to
sustained growth in middle-income countries. We find no significant connection
between innovation performance and economic growth. This suggests that while
R&D and capital markets may contribute to innovation through entrepreneurship,
this contribution is not impactful enough to drive economic growth in
developing countries. Our findings provide further evidence of the
middle-income trap.

institutions, and policies. Investigating 34 OECD members, this study describes
five varieties of capitalism: traditional, dualistic, government-led, open
market-based, and human capital-based models. It is suggested that the most
significant cut-off point in the development of OECD economies in this period
was along the green growth dimension, where European countries with a tradition
in coordinated markets outperform the rest. Using Israel and Estonia as an
example, it is also suggested that institutional and policy changes that
enhance the quality of governance and make coordination more effective are the
way out of the middle-income trap.

TL;DR: 研究埃塞俄比亚、尼日利亚和坦桑尼亚农民性别与农业商业化关系，发现商业化性别差距因国家而异，需定制政策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业商业化虽被视为撒哈拉以南非洲发展关键驱动力，但益处可能并非惠及所有农民，需研究农民性别与农业商业化的关系。

Method: 使用LSMS - ISA的纵向家庭数据和双向Mundlak固定效应估计器进行研究。

Result: 埃塞俄比亚和尼日利亚女性户主家庭及女性管理土地占比高的家庭在市场参与上有劣势，参与销售时更倾向卖给市场买家；坦桑尼亚性别与商业化的负面关联较弱。

Conclusion: 商业化性别差距高度因地制宜，需制定针对各国的政策解决女农民面临的制度和市场限制。

Abstract: Agricultural commercialization is often promoted as a key driver of
development in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet its benefits may not extend equally to
all farmers. Using longitudinal household data from the LSMS-ISA and a two-way
Mundlak fixed effects estimator, we examine the relationship between farmers'
gender and agricultural commercialization in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania.
In Ethiopia and Nigeria, women-headed households and those with a higher share
of women-managed land face substantial disadvantages in market engagement,
particularly in households oriented towards self-consumption. Interestingly, in
both countries, women-headed households that do engage in sales are more likely
to sell to market buyers and less likely to sell to individual buyers compared
to men-headed households. In contrast, in Tanzania, the negative associations
between gender and commercialization are weaker and less robust across
outcomes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in
commercialization are highly context-specific rather than universal,
highlighting the need for country-tailored policies that address the
institutional and market constraints faced by women farmers.

Motivation: 开发以健康饮食成本为依据的方法，为印尼针对性营养规划提供信息。

Method: 采用三步法，结合印尼详细零售价格和家庭调查数据，分析区域价格差异、识别无法负担健康饮食的家庭、分析饮食营养充足性。

Result: 超98%印尼家庭食品支出能满足国家饮食指南，但多数家庭高能量零食摄入多，果蔬等摄入少；高收入家庭营养充足性更好但仍未达推荐标准。

Conclusion: 实际食物需求与最低成本健康饮食不同，受口味、便利性和社会文化等非价格因素影响。

Abstract: New methods for modeling least-cost diets that meet nutritional requirements
for health have emerged as important tools for informing nutrition policy and
programming around the world. This study develops a three-step approach using
cost of healthy diet to inform targeted nutrition programming in Indonesia. We
combine detailed retail prices and household survey data from Indonesia to
describe how reported consumption and expenditure patterns across all levels of
household income diverge from least cost healthy diets using items from nearby
markets. In this analysis, we examine regional price variations, identify
households with insufficient income for healthy diets, and analyze the nutrient
adequacy of reported consumption patterns. We find that household food spending
was sufficient to meet national dietary guidelines using the least expensive
locally available items for over 98% of Indonesians, but almost all households
consume substantial quantities of discretionary foods and mixed dishes while
consuming too little energy from fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and
seeds. Households with higher incomes have higher nutrient adequacy and are
closer to meeting local dietary guidelines, but still fall short of
recommendations. These findings shed new light on how actual food demand
differs from least-cost healthy diets, due to factors other than affordability,
such as taste, convenience, and aspirations shaped by marketing and other
sociocultural influences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究聚焦于MB内投射神经元（PN）到KC的连接，本文旨在研究KC到MBON神经回路结构和连接变化如何影响MBON区分气味类别的能力。

Method: 构建包含PN、KC和MBON连接的神经网络，生成十种人工输入类别训练模型，收集相关指标数据，进行KC消融、突触连接修剪和PN到KC回路重连实验。

Result: 很少有突触前KC的MBON在气味分类任务中表现较差；KC发育类型对MBON输出有显著影响；消融发育成熟的KC比未成熟的KC对MBON学习能力负面影响更大；突触连接修剪结果与消融实验基本一致。

Conclusion: 研究增进了对嗅觉神经可塑性的理解，为理解学习和记忆提供重要线索，在人工智能和神经退行性疾病治疗方面有潜在应用。

Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory
learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to
mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning
process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell
(KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom
body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC
to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability
to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that
incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model,
we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection
neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number
of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights,
among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs
consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The
developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's
output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating
developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning
capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON
synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation
experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed
rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our
understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to
understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory
circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial
intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

<details>

Motivation: 基于大语言模型的语音生成模型在多码本结构预测时，简单并行预测方法存在保真度降低问题，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统研究两种局部变压器架构（自回归变压器和基于MaskGIT的变压器），并结合帧堆叠技术，分析并行和迭代采样策略。

Result: 两种设计能在不影响感知质量的前提下提高速度，还分析了不同吞吐量和质量条件下不同采样策略的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出基于计算效率和合成保真度等部署优先级选择解码策略的实用指南。

Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically
operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens
due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N
codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple
parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among
codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced
fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer
(LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this
work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive
transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based
transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further
enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames
jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed
without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we
characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies
across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical
guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities
such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.

Method: 提出一种新颖的多阶段强化学习训练框架。

Result: 模型相比强基线有显著提升，超越更大的MLLMs，显著缩小与基于文本的大语言模型的差距。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效增强MLLMs的语音摘要能力。

Abstract: Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding,
particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent
advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of
LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without
intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot
generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the
state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for
speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage
reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization
capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong
baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap
with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.

Method: 评估图像生成CFG策略用于语音合成的适应性，扩展分离条件的CFG方法，分阶段应用标准CFG和选择性CFG。

Result: 图像生成有效的CFG策略难改善语音合成；分阶段应用CFG可改善说话人相似度并减少文本一致性下降；选择性CFG策略效果高度依赖文本表示。

Conclusion: 图像生成的CFG策略不能直接用于语音合成，分阶段使用CFG可优化语音合成效果，且要考虑文本表示的影响。

Abstract: In zero-shot text-to-speech, achieving a balance between fidelity to the
target speaker and adherence to text content remains a challenge. While
classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image
generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating
the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired
characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the
adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to
speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain.
Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally
fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker
similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard
CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later
timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG
strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the
two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with
the same model.

Result: 在低信噪比条件下将WER降低15%，有效提高语音准确性和语义合理性，自适应扩散步数可平衡伪影抑制和延迟。

Conclusion: 语义先验是引导生成式语音增强实现无伪影输出的有力工具。

Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) achieves natural-sounding speech and
strong generalization, yet suffers from key limitations like generative
artifacts and high inference latency. In this work, we systematically study
artifact prediction and reduction in diffusion-based SE. We show that variance
in speech embeddings can be used to predict phonetic errors during inference.
Building on these findings, we propose an ensemble inference method guided by
semantic consistency across multiple diffusion runs. This technique reduces WER
by 15% in low-SNR conditions, effectively improving phonetic accuracy and
semantic plausibility. Finally, we analyze the effect of the number of
diffusion steps, showing that adaptive diffusion steps balance artifact
suppression and latency. Our findings highlight semantic priors as a powerful
tool to guide generative SE toward artifact-free outputs.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升音频分类性能，轻量级方法在推理性能上表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening"
to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance.
Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language
models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated
into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the
category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be
designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We
demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification
accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the
number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source
reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are
capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the
embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the
performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.

Conclusion: 所提改进和利用注意力机制的方法可有效解决基于大语言模型的TTS模型的稳定性幻觉问题。

Abstract: This paper focuses on resolving stability hallucinations (e.g., repetitive or
omitted speech) in LLM-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models by improving and
leveraging the attention mechanism. First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism
between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed
the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to
evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into
the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable
alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide
the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which
further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on
the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods
can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without
introducing additional negative effects. The appendix is available at

Result: CoMelSinger在音高准确性、音色一致性和零样本可迁移性上比基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: CoMelSinger框架有效，能解决SVS中旋律控制及韵律泄漏问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances
from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent
progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot
generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS
remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In
particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where
pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt,
compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework
that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec
modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture,
CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens,
preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To
suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning
strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic
prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only
Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch
and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental
results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch
accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive
baselines.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of meshfree collocation methods for
numerically approximating differential operators on continuously labeled
unstructured point clouds. Meshfree collocation methods do not require a
computational grid or mesh. Instead, they approximate smooth functions and
their derivatives at potentially irregularly distributed collocation points,
often called particles, to a desired order of consistency. We review several
meshfree collocation methods from the literature, trace the historical
development of key concepts, and propose a classification of methods according
to their principle of derivation. Although some of the methods reviewed are
similar or identical, there are subtle yet important differences between many,
which we highlight and discuss. We present a unifying formulation of meshfree
collocation methods that renders these differences apparent and show how each
method can be derived from this formulation. Finally, we propose a generalized
derivation for meshfree collocation methods going forward.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given $m \ge 2$ discrete probability distributions over $n$ states each, the
minimum-entropy coupling is the minimum-entropy joint distribution whose
marginals are the same as the input distributions. Computing the
minimum-entropy coupling is NP-hard, but there has been significant progress in
designing approximation algorithms; prior to this work, the best known
polynomial-time algorithms attain guarantees of the form $H(\operatorname{ALG})
\le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + c$, where $c \approx 0.53$ for $m=2$, and $c
\approx 1.22$ for general $m$ [CKQGK '23].
  A main open question is whether this task is APX-hard, or whether there
exists a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). In this work, we design
an algorithm that produces a coupling with entropy $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le
H(\operatorname{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in running time
$n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \operatorname{exp}(m) )}$:
showing a PTAS exists for constant $m$.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效减少数据丢失和资源浪费，提升社会福利，可用于O-RAN场景资源管理。

Abstract: The development of the Open RAN (O-RAN) framework helps enable network
slicing through its virtualization, interoperability, and flexibility. To
improve spectral efficiency and better meet users' dynamic and heterogeneous
service demands, O-RAN's flexibility further presents an opportunity for
resource reselling of unused physical resource blocks (PRBs) across users. In
this work, we propose a novel game-based user-to-user PRB reselling model in
the O-RAN setting, which models the carryover of unmet demand across time
slots, along with how users' internal buffer states relate to any PRBs
purchased. We formulate the interplay between the users as a strategic game,
with each participant aiming to maximize their own payoffs, and we prove the
existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the game. We
furthermore propose an iterative bidding mechanism that converges to this NE.
Extensive simulations show that our best approach reduces data loss by 30.5%
and spectrum resource wastage by 50.7% while significantly improving social
welfare, compared to its absence.

Method: 提出基于SDN的DT短期异常检测框架，利用综合数据集、特征的时间感知标记和对多种机器学习模型的综合评估，提出SD - TWIN异常检测算法。

Result: 新的实时SD - TWIN部署中，GPU加速LightGBM模型有效，实现高召回率和强分类性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 基于SDN的DT可实现IIoT环境的动态安全监控，GPU加速LightGBM模型适用于该场景的异常检测。

Abstract: Secure monitoring and dynamic control in an IIoT environment are major
requirements for current development goals. We believe that dynamic, secure
monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the
Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current
literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware
intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT
threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly
detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware
labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine
learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm.
According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU-
accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of
high recall and strong classification performance.

Conclusion: 研究结果为无线生态系统和未来研究的一个基本开放性问题提供了及时见解。

Abstract: Differentiable ray tracing has recently challenged the status quo in radio
propagation modelling and digital twinning. Promising unprecedented speed and
the ability to learn from real-world data, it offers a real alternative to
conventional deep learning (DL) models. However, no experimental evaluation on
production-grade networks has yet validated its assumed scalability or
practical benefits. This leaves mobile network operators (MNOs) and the
research community without clear guidance on its applicability. In this paper,
we fill this gap by employing both differentiable ray tracing and DL models to
emulate radio coverage using extensive real-world data collected from the
network of a major MNO, covering 13 cities and more than 10,000 antennas. Our
results show that, while differentiable ray-tracing simulators have contributed
to reducing the efficiency-accuracy gap, they struggle to generalize from
real-world data at a large scale, and they remain unsuitable for real-time
applications. In contrast, DL models demonstrate higher accuracy and faster
adaptation than differentiable ray-tracing simulators across urban, suburban,
and rural deployments, achieving accuracy gains of up to 3 dB. Our experimental
results aim to provide timely insights into a fundamental open question with
direct implications on the wireless ecosystem and future research.

Motivation: 6G网络需支持按需AI模型下载，但当代AI模型尺寸大，给边缘缓存和无线信道并发传输带来挑战。

Method: 提出细粒度AI模型缓存和下载系统，利用参数可复用性；采用CoMP广播；构建模型下载延迟最小化问题；开发分布式多智能体学习框架；提出数据增强方法。

Result: 理论分析和仿真实验验证了所提出学习框架具有优越的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 所提系统和框架能有效解决6G网络中AI模型边缘缓存和下载的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to
accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching
models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency
for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI
models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage
capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over
wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI
model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability,
stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a
shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches
model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of
reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it
incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously
deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum
utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay
minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge
nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we
develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to
explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating
cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to
adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model,
boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical
analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence
performance of the proposed learning framework.

Motivation: 缓解单服务器联邦学习的通信瓶颈，利用多服务器架构中重叠区域客户端的潜力。

Method: 提出FedOC框架，重叠客户端分ROCs和NOCs，前者实时转发边缘模型，后者根据交付时间选初始模型，每轮客户端训练后上传，ES聚合、通过ROC中继传输、二次聚合后广播模型。

Result: 实验结果显示该方案相比现有方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: FedOC能间接实现跨单元模型传播、加速训练，适合对延迟敏感的边缘环境。

Abstract: Multi-server Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate communication bottlenecks of single-server FL. We focus on a typical
multi-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge
servers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that
clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple
ESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with
Overlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential
of these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual
roles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models
between neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among
different ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically
select their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery
time, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The
overall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains
local model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the
respective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated
edge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed
models, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the
updated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of
each ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which
indirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process,
making it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments. Extensive
experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate outdoor positioning in cellular networks is hindered by sparse,
heterogeneous measurement collections and the high cost of exhaustive site
surveys. This paper introduces a lightweight, modular mobile data augmentation
framework designed to enhance multi-cell fingerprinting-based positioning using
operator-collected minimization of drive test (MDT) records. The proposed
approach decouples spatial and radio-feature synthesis: kernel density
estimation (KDE) models the empirical spatial distribution to generate
geographically coherent synthetic locations, while a k-nearest-neighbor
(KNN)-based block produces augmented per-cell radio fingerprints. The
architecture is intentionally training-free, interpretable, and suitable for
distributed or on-premise operator deployments, supporting privacy-aware
workflows. We both validate each augmentation module independently and assess
its end-to-end impact on fingerprinting-based positioning using a real-world
MDT dataset provided by an Italian mobile network operator across diverse urban
and peri-urban scenarios. Results show that the proposed KDE-KNN augmentation
consistently improves positioning performance, with the largest benefits in
sparsely sampled or structurally complex regions; we also observe
region-dependent saturation effects as augmentation increases. The framework
offers a practical, low-complexity path to enhance operator positioning
services using existing mobile data traces.

Abstract: As the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system continues its global
deployment, both industry and academia have started conceptualizing the 6th

devices. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of 6G, beginning with its
main stringent requirements while focusing on key enabling technologies such as
terahertz (THz) communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces, massive MIMO

these advancements. At the end, we outline the potential challenges that must

Result: 在托管NVIDIA云游戏服务器的ISP部署该方法，分析了三个月内数十万次云游戏流会话。

Abstract: To tap into the growing market of cloud gaming, whereby game graphics is
rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as a video feed, network
operators are creating monetizable assurance services that dynamically
provision network resources. However, without accurately measuring cloud gaming
user experience, they cannot assess the effectiveness of their provisioning
methods. Basic measures such as bandwidth and frame rate by themselves do not
suffice, and can only be interpreted in the context of the game played and the
player activity within the game. This paper equips the network operator with a
method to obtain a real-time measure of cloud gaming experience by analyzing
network traffic, including contextual factors such as the game title and player
activity stage. Our method is able to classify the game title within the first
five seconds of game launch, and continuously assess the player activity stage
as being active, passive, or idle. We deploy it in an ISP hosting NVIDIA cloud
gaming servers for the region. We provide insights from hundreds of thousands
of cloud game streaming sessions over a three-month period into the dependence
of bandwidth consumption and experience level on the gameplay contexts.

Motivation: 现代机器人在人机共享工作空间对反应性需求增加，但机载处理器受限，HPC用于实时机器人的可行性因网络延迟不确定。

Method: 在压力测试场景下，使用并行化多目标A*搜索在本地和远程HPC集群上实现SHARP系统。

Result: 本地规划平均延迟22.9ms，远程（约300km外）30.0ms，避障成功率分别为84%和88%。

Conclusion: 当往返延迟在几十毫秒内，HPC计算不是瓶颈，可激发混合控制架构，SHARP为评估HPC驱动机器人实时可行性提供模板，证明HPC卸载是可行途径。

Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and
Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance
computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control.
While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human--robot
shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost.
Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its
feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and
jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator
must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A*
search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system
achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300
km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These
results show that when round-trip latency remains within the
tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck,
enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate
hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety,
while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for
scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study
provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of
HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable
pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: ROPA在眼到手双手操作的RGB和RGB - D数据增强方面有可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning
requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and
scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world
demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior
works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either
eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel
images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand
(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this
paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data
Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method
that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D
observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates
corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained
optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate
gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our
method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625
simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms
baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data
augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Motivation: 当前跨多任务训练通用智能体需要大规模专家演示，收集成本高、劳动强度大，需解决少监督挑战。

Method: 提出SEIL框架，通过模拟器交互逐步改进少样本模型；采用双级增强（模型级用EMA模型协作、环境级引入初始物体位置变化）；引入轻量级选择器筛选轨迹。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SEIL在少样本模仿学习场景下取得新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SEIL框架能以更少训练样本让模型达到有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent
across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which
are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited
supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework
that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions.
The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful
trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To
enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level
augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model
to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing
slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a
lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories
from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples
enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training
examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves
a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

Result: RoboSSM能有效外推不同数量的上下文内演示，在未见任务上性能高，在长视野场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSM有潜力成为ICIL高效可扩展的骨干。

Abstract: In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from
prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need
for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot
adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers,
which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling
longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce
RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on
state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with
Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and
strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context
prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it
against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM
extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations,
yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and
scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该成果是迈向物理AI的重要一步，融合基于模型的控制和基于学习的轨迹生成方法。

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are
not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance
Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting
feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a
framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with
cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force
Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space
behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise
scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then
passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping
parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task
axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were
collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using
teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples,
the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational
accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and
autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller
achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30
success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any
peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the
Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision
Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an
important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical
interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Motivation: 解决无人飞行器在感知能力受限且无全局定位情况下，高速穿越未知非结构化环境与跟踪目标的难题，现有相对导航方法无法解决无目标时的导航问题。

Method: 提出HUNT实时框架，在统一相对公式中实现遍历、获取和跟踪，直接根据机载瞬时可观测值定义导航目标。

Result: 在茂密森林、集装箱场地以及有车辆和人体模型的搜索救援行动等户外实验中展示出强大自主性，全局方法则失效。

Conclusion: HUNT框架能有效实现无人飞行器在复杂场景下的高速导航与目标跟踪。

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both
traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once
detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global
localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation
have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible
detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field
of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time
framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single
relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard
instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling
reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same
perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor
experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue
operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where
global methods fail.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航策略多基于单模态训练，适应现实场景能力有限，需能处理不同形式目标规范的导航策略。

Method: 利用高容量视觉 - 语言 - 动作（VLA）骨干网络，通过随机模态融合策略，用2D姿态、以自我为中心的图像、自然语言及其组合三种主要目标模态进行训练。

Conclusion: OmniVLA朝着广泛通用和灵活的导航策略迈进，为构建全模态机器人基础模型提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such
as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when
navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation
policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to
real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural
and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic
foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based
navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)
backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric
images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a
randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of
usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,
semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves
strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,
and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate
that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a
flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe

Conclusion: 提出的约束参数化潜在安全过滤器可有效实现运行时对任意安全约束的适应。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space
of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for
hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is
known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety
filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose
constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified
safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by
conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a
latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned
in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely
the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety
filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any
image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling
runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware
experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show
that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of
user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance. Video

Motivation: 以自我为中心的人类经验数据可用于机器人操作的端到端模仿学习，但人与机器人在视觉外观、传感器模态和运动学方面存在显著领域差距，阻碍知识转移。

Method: 提出EgoBridge统一协同训练框架，使用域适应显式对齐人和机器人数据的策略潜在空间，基于最优传输（OT）对联合策略潜在特征和动作的差异进行度量，学习既能在人和机器人领域间对齐又能保留对策略学习至关重要的动作相关信息的观察表示。

Conclusion: EgoBridge框架有效解决了人与机器人领域差距问题，提升了策略成功率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up
end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant
domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between
human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a
unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces
between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of
discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal
Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align
between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant
information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant
absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented
cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual
manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and
tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and

Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge
across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms,
and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control
strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of
scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the
need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves
controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents
tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy
for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces
acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader
we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to
the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large
groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a
straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced
architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation
strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出基于学习的生成式运动规划器形式安全验证方法，构建验证参考库提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式运动规划器优势明显，但输出安全和动态可行性验证困难，因神经网络验证工具可处理神经元数量有限，而规划器含大量神经元。

Result: 在多种规划器上评估，在仿真和硬件实验中提升安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法可在不重新训练的情况下提升生成式运动规划器的安全性。

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based
generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages
over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of
their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale
only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve
GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate
the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural
tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This
yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the
controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a
library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that
imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving
safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including
diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in
simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware
(differential-drive robot).

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法受模仿学习限制，编码物理规则困难，其他方法有局限。

Method: 构建ReflectDrive框架，离散二维驾驶空间构建动作码本，用预训练扩散语言模型微调，利用安全感知反射机制迭代自纠正。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ReflectDrive在安全关键轨迹生成上有显著优势。

Conclusion: ReflectDrive为自动驾驶系统提供可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

Method: 提出AnchDrive框架，用混合轨迹锚点初始化规划器，锚点来自通用驾驶先验静态词汇表和动态上下文感知轨迹，扩散模型学习预测轨迹偏移分布来细化锚点。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，AnchDrive达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: AnchDrive具有高效生成多样高质量轨迹的能力，泛化性强。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in
autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the
generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a
framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy
to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models.
Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a
rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two
complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set
of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in
real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features.
The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a
distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This
anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse,
high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that
AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

Conclusion: VisualMimic框架有效解决了类人机器人在非结构化环境中的运动操作问题，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to
generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real
framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control
for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint
tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with
a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual
and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the
low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.
VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in
simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of
loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and
kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize
robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:
