### [1] [A Survey of Task-Oriented Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Status, Applications, and Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11012)
*Guanglin Niu,Bo Li,Yangguang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文对知识图谱推理（KGR）研究进行全面综述，按不同任务分类方法总结，探讨先进技术影响，指出研究趋势与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有综述缺乏对所有KGR任务，特别是下游应用和更具挑战性推理范式的系统总结，需要更全面视角的综述。

Method: 按主要推理任务、下游应用任务和潜在挑战性推理任务对KGR方法进行分类，探讨如大语言模型等先进技术的影响。

Result: 对KGR研究提供了更全面视角，梳理不同类型的KGR任务。

Conclusion: 强调了KGR领域的关键研究趋势，并勾勒出有前景的未来方向。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

### [2] [OntoGSN: An Ontology for Dynamic Management of Assurance Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11023)
*Tomas Bueno Momcilovic,Barbara Gallina,Ingmar Kessler,Dian Balta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出OntoGSN用于管理目标结构化表示法（GSN）标准的保证案例，包括知识表示、可查询图等，并通过示例展示其在动态AC管理中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在构建保证案例（ACs）时，管理ACs面临挑战，维护嵌入知识需大量精力，可能导致管理不善。

Method: 提出OntoGSN，包括将GSN社区标准v3形式化到OWL本体、辅助本体和解析器、设计决策文档、SPARQL查询库和原型接口等。

Result: 本体严格遵循标准文本，按FAIR原则、OOPS框架等进行评估，其他中间件元素开发受社区需求指导并持续评估。

Conclusion: 通过大语言模型对抗鲁棒性保证的示例，证明了所提方法在动态AC管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

### [3] [LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models as a Clinical Evaluation Judge with Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11221)
*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文结合模糊逻辑和大语言模型，提出LLM - as - a - Fuzzy - Judge方法解决医学生临床技能自动评估与主观偏好对齐问题，该方法准确率超80%，主要标准项超90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床沟通技能实践和评估具有挑战性，现有LLM临床场景模拟难以提供符合医生细致判断的自动化、可扩展临床评估，需使医学生临床技能自动评估与医生主观偏好对齐。

Method: 从LLM医疗教育系统收集数据，基于多维模糊集进行数据标注，接着进行提示工程，用人工标注对预训练LLM进行监督微调。

Result: LLM - as - a - Fuzzy - Judge准确率超80%，主要标准项超90%，有效利用模糊逻辑和LLM实现可解释、符合人类偏好的评估。

Conclusion: 利用模糊逻辑和LLM与人类偏好对齐是可行的，推动了医学教育自动化评估，支持更可靠的评估和判断实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this
work is available at https://github.com/2sigmaEdTech/LLMAsAJudge

### [4] [MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331)
*Jihoon Yun,Chengzhang Li,Dhrubojyoti Roy,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MUDAS框架用于资源受限的物联网场景下多标签声音分类，评估显示其优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督域适应（UDA）算法用于单标签任务且计算资源需求大，难以用于多标签场景和资源受限的物联网设备，如城市声音分类场景。

Method: 开发MUDAS框架，通过选择性地使用高置信度数据原位重新训练分类器，结合特定类别的自适应阈值生成可靠伪标签，并应用多样性正则化。

Result: 在SONYC - UST数据集上评估，MUDAS在分类准确性上比现有UDA算法有显著提升。

Conclusion: MUDAS能在资源受限的物联网环境中实现良好性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

### [5] [Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375)
*Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Qingyang Mao,Yucong Luo,Qi Liu,Yupeng Li,Xiaohan Zhang,Deguang Liu,Xin Li,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出大规模化学表格基准ChemTable，评估多种模型，揭示化学表格理解挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视化学表格多模态和特定领域复杂性，限制多模态大语言模型对化学科学理解的支持。

Method: 从文献实验部分整理真实化学表格构建ChemTable基准，支持表格识别和理解两个核心任务，评估多种代表性多模态模型。

Result: 模型在基本布局解析有一定表现，但在描述性和推理问答任务上与人类表现有差距，开源和闭源模型在多维度有显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调化学感知表格理解的挑战，表明ChemTable是推进科学推理的严格且现实的基准。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭护理者面临心理健康挑战，探索大语言模型驱动的对话代理提供循证心理健康支持的潜力。

Method: 进行内主体实验，让28名护理者与四种大语言模型配置交互，评估同理心和治疗联盟。

Result: 表现最佳的模型结合特定提示技术和临床示例，在定性和定量评估中展现出更好的情境理解和个性化支持，参与者认可其多种能力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在为家庭护理者提供共情和定制化支持方面有潜力，但平衡全面评估和高效建议交付仍有挑战。

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

### [7] [FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419)
*Bin Sun,Boao Zhang,Jiayi Lu,Xinjie Feng,Jiachen Shang,Rui Cao,Mengchao Zheng,Chuanye Wang,Shichun Yang,Yaoguang Cao,Ziying Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出FocalAD框架聚焦局部交互以改进端到端自动驾驶规划，实验显示优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶运动预测方法依赖全局特征，忽略局部交互，影响规划可靠性。

Method: 提出FocalAD框架，含ELAI和FLA Loss模块，前者进行基于图的交互表示，后者增加关键邻域权重。

Result: 在nuScenes、Bench2Drive等数据集上表现优于现有方法，在Adv - nuScenes数据集上平均碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: FocalAD框架聚焦局部交互能有效提升端到端自动驾驶规划性能。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

### [8] [Resolve Highway Conflict in Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Controls with Local State Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11445)
*Xuan Duy Ta,Bang Giang Le,Thanh Ha Le,Viet Cuong Ta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Local State Attention模块辅助输入状态表示，在模拟高速合并场景中提升了合并效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习方法在训练时难以解决智能体间局部冲突，且无法泛化到随机事件，因此需要改进方法使自动驾驶车辆适应混合交通环境。

Method: 提出Local State Attention模块，借助自注意力算子压缩附近智能体的关键信息以解决交通冲突。

Result: 在模拟高速合并场景中，与流行基线相比，特别是在高密度交通环境下，合并效率有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的Local State Attention模块能有效解决多智能体强化学习中的问题，提高自动驾驶车辆在混合交通环境中的交通处理效率。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

### [9] [Schema-R1: A reasoning training approach for schema linking in Text-to-SQL Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11986)
*Wuzhenghong Wen,Su Pan,yuwei Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Schema - R1推理模式链接模型，用强化学习训练，提升模型推理能力，过滤准确率提升10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式链接模型微调方法采用死记硬背范式，牺牲推理能力，且下游任务难获取高质量推理样本。

Method: 提出Schema - R1模型，包含构建高质量推理小批量样本、监督微调冷启动初始化、基于规则的强化学习训练三个关键步骤。

Result: 方法有效提升模式链接模型推理能力，过滤准确率比现有方法提高10%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升模式链接模型推理能力。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

### [10] [Structure-Aware Automatic Channel Pruning by Searching with Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11469)
*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结构感知自动通道剪枝框架SACP，利用GCN建模网络拓扑，实验表明其在压缩效率上优于现有方法，精度相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法依赖局部启发式或基于权重标准，无法捕捉网络全局结构依赖，导致剪枝决策欠佳和模型性能下降。

Method: 提出SACP框架，用GCN建模网络拓扑学习通道全局重要性，实现拓扑感知剪枝；将剪枝率组合限制在特定空间，用搜索方法确定最优组合。

Result: 在基准数据集（CIFAR - 10、ImageNet）和多种模型（ResNet、VGG16）上的实验显示，SACP在压缩效率上优于现有剪枝方法，精度保留上有竞争力。

Conclusion: SACP框架有效，能解决现有剪枝方法的局限性。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

TL;DR: 本文提出改进框架DSP+，无需额外训练或微调，在多个定理证明任务中表现良好，还能发现形式化错误，开源所有组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现不进行训练，通过神经符号协调现有推理模型和策略步骤证明器也能有可比性能，探索经典推理模式潜力。

Method: 提出改进的Draft, Sketch, and Prove框架DSP+，对各阶段进行细粒度和集成的神经符号增强。

Result: DSP+在多个数据集解决一定数量问题，证明此前未解决的IMO问题，生成人类可理解证明模式，发现形式化错误。

Conclusion: 凸显了除基于强化学习训练外经典推理模式的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了RAG+，它在RAG管道中加入应用感知推理，实验显示其性能优于标准RAG变体，推动了更具认知基础的知识整合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG范式常忽略知识应用的认知步骤，存在检索事实与特定任务推理间的差距。

Method: 引入RAG+，构建包含知识和对齐应用示例的双语料库，推理时联合检索。

Result: 在多个模型的数学、法律和医学领域实验中，RAG+始终优于标准RAG变体，平均提升3 - 5%，复杂场景最高提升7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+通过连接检索和可操作应用，推动了更具认知基础的知识整合框架，迈向更具可解释性和能力的大语言模型。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型付费成本高，小模型推理能力不足，研究大小模型协作结合优势。

Result: 方法达到与强专有模型相当的准确率，显著减少对付费推理的依赖。

Conclusion: 规划是在现实部署约束下编排成本感知、跨模型推理的有效先验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid

*René Peinl,Vincent Tischler*

TL;DR: 本文介绍评估德语视觉语言模型的新基准数据集，评估13个模型，发现模型表现不佳，认为中学任务可用于测试模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英文基准常使用人为难题或脱离上下文问题，缺乏结合视觉推理与特定领域背景知识的德语基准数据集，需要新基准测试视觉语言模型能力。

Method: 构建包含9个领域、超2000个开放式问题和486张图像的数据集，从多维度评估13个先进开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 最强模型整体准确率不足45%，在音乐、数学和对抗设置中表现差，流行基准测试与现实多模态理解存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 中学水平任务是测试视觉语言模型的有效途径，尤其在非英语环境中，数据集和评估协议可帮助提升未来AI系统能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有减轻多模态大语言模型幻觉方法存在优化目标函数不严谨和偏好监督间接的问题。

Method: 提出SymMPO方法，进行对称偏好学习和直接偏好监督，引入偏好边际一致性损失。

Result: 在五个基准测试中SymMPO表现出色。

Conclusion: SymMPO能有效减轻多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R - GNNs基于GNN学习值函数以泛化到给定规划领域的未见问题，理论上受GNN表达能力与$C_2$联系的启发，部分规划领域最优值函数可分解为$C_2$特征算术表达式。

Method: 对R - GNNs学习由$C_2$特征定义值函数的能力进行研究。

Result: R - GNNs无法学习由$C_2$特征定义的值函数。

Conclusion: 确定了可能更好学习由$C_2$特征定义值函数的先前GNN架构。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

Motivation: 解决存在潜在混杂因素时治疗变量对结果因果效应的估计问题。

Method: 提出基于矩的算法估计因果效应，证明可识别性条件，提出识别数据生成机制中参数变化的程序。

Result: 特定条件下因果效应可识别，若潜在和治疗变量外生噪声分布都变化则失去可识别性。

Conclusion: 所提方法可用于估计因果效应和识别数据生成机制参数变化，经合成数据实验验证有效。

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Result: LLMs能有效利用享乐变量产生有意义估计，传统机器学习模型预测更准，但LLMs更易获取、交互和解释，精心选择上下文示例可提升性能，但LLMs存在过度自信和空间推理有限问题。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力提高房地产评估透明度，为利益相关者提供可操作的见解。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs用于模拟社会行为时，其政治偏见和辩论互动动态未充分研究，需探究LLM类型和智能体性别属性对政治偏见的影响。

Method: 采用结构化多智能体辩论框架，让中立、共和党、民主党美国LLM智能体就政治敏感话题辩论，系统改变底层LLM、智能体性别和辩论形式。

Result: 中立智能体始终倾向民主党，共和党向中立靠近；性别影响智能体态度；有相同政治立场的智能体可形成回音室。

Conclusion: 明确了LLM类型和智能体性别属性在辩论中对政治偏见和态度的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Motivation: 语言技术在高风险场景使用增多，但大语言模型存在伦理问题，如人口统计偏差等，因此要分析基于Transformers系统学习数据中偏差的能力并减轻偏差。

Method: 以基于AI的自动招聘为例，提出隐私增强框架减少学习流程中的性别信息。

Result: 实验分析了数据偏差对基于两种不同大语言模型构建的系统的影响，验证了所提框架能有效防止训练系统重现数据中的偏差。

Conclusion: 所提出的隐私增强框架可有效减轻基于大语言模型系统的偏差行为。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现有效的人机决策，平衡预测正确性、知识成本和推理复杂度、是否弃权自动化答案或引入人类专家这三个关键因素。

Method: 提出级联LLM决策框架，分两步：根据置信度决定接受基础模型答案或用大模型重新生成；决定级联模型响应是否足够确定或需人工干预，还加入在线学习机制。

Result: 在通用问答和医疗问答任务中，级联策略在大多数情况下准确率优于单模型基线，同时降低成本并提供处理弃权的原则方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的级联LLM决策框架有效可行。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数基准测试忽视大语言模型中间推理步骤，测量这些内部过程对理解模型行为和提高可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出用战略游戏作为评估环境，构建评估框架，定义超越胜率的指标。

Result: ChatGPT - o3 - mini综合得分最高，Qwen - Plus因过度使用资源胜率低，过矫正风险率和矫正成功率负相关。

Conclusion: 评估大语言模型不仅要关注决策结果，还要关注决策过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

Result: 发现Deepseek - R1 - Distill系列及其微调模型和QwQ - 32B模型评估结果因细微评估条件差异有大幅变化，性能提升难复现。

Conclusion: 应建立更严格的模型性能评估范式。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Motivation: PINNs求解声波场在二维简单几何形状有成果，但前向问题在收敛到真实解上有诸多待克服的问题，旨在建模含吸收体的房间声学低频行为。

Method: 研究3D房间声学案例，改变源定义和边界条件集数量，使用复声速模型考虑吸收，通过查看PINN架构损失景观和与有限元参考模拟对比L2误差评估收敛行为。

Result: 收敛研究表明每波长至少六个训练点对PINN准确训练和后续预测是必要的。

Conclusion: PINNs可用于三维低频房间声学建模，且明确了准确训练和预测所需的训练点数量。

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Result: 在多个公开MI数据集上，CLEAN - MI实现了数据质量和分类性能的持续提升。

Conclusion: CLEAN - MI是一种可扩展且系统的数据构建管道，能有效构建大规模、高效准确的神经数据。

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Motivation: 现有RDF序列化格式在性能、压缩比和RDF流支持上存在不足。

Method: 基于Protocol Buffers设计Jelly，有开放协议规范、多语言实现及命令行工具。

Result: 介绍了Jelly并列举其适用用例。

Conclusion: Jelly兼具实用性和高效性，是语义网工具栈的重要贡献。

Abstract: Existing RDF serialization formats such as Turtle, N-Triples, and JSON-LD are
widely used for communication and storage in knowledge graph and Semantic Web
applications. However, they suffer from limitations in performance, compression
ratio, and lack of native support for RDF streams. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce Jelly, a fast and convenient binary serialization
format for RDF data that supports both batch and streaming use cases. Jelly is
designed to maximize serialization throughput, reduce file size with
lightweight streaming compression, and minimize compute resource usage. Built
on Protocol Buffers, Jelly is easy to integrate with modern programming
languages and RDF libraries. To maximize reusability, Jelly has an open
protocol specification, open-source implementations in Java and Python
integrated with popular RDF libraries, and a versatile command-line tool. To
illustrate its usefulness, we outline concrete use cases where Jelly can
provide tangible benefits. By combining practical usability with
state-of-the-art efficiency, Jelly is an important contribution to the Semantic
Web tool stack.

Motivation: 传统流程挖掘技术以用例为中心，在对象中心流程挖掘（OCPM）中不再适用，需新方法。

Method: 提出名为OCPQ的对象中心流程查询方法，实现高性能执行引擎后端和易用编辑器前端。

Result: 评估显示先前工作表达能力不足，运行时性能显著优于SQLite和Neo4j，与DuckDB相当。

Conclusion: OCPQ是一种高度表达性的对象中心流程查询方法，有良好应用前景和性能。

Abstract: Process querying is used to extract information and insights from process
execution data. Similarly, process constraints can be checked against input
data, yielding information on which process instances violate them.
Traditionally, such process mining techniques use case-centric event data as
input. However, with the uptake of Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM),
existing querying and constraint checking techniques are no longer applicable.
Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) removes the requirement to pick a single case
notion (i.e., requiring that events belong to exactly one case) and can thus
represent many real-life processes much more accurately. In this paper, we
present a novel highly-expressive approach for object-centric process querying,
called OCPQ. It supports a wide variety of applications, including OCED-based
constraint checking and filtering. The visual representation of nested queries
in OCPQ allows users to intuitively read and create queries and constraints. We
implemented our approach using (1) a high-performance execution engine backend
and (2) an easy-to-use editor frontend. Additionally, we evaluated our approach
on a real-life dataset, showing the lack in expressiveness of prior work and
runtime performance significantly better than the general querying solutions
SQLite and Neo4j, as well as comparable to the performance-focused DuckDB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库连接器安全漏洞常被忽视，传统模糊测试和大语言模型生成测试用例方法难以检测其漏洞。

Method: 构建参数化提示模板为大语言模型提供领域知识，用大语言模型生成测试用例并通过差异测试动态评估，利用强化学习根据反馈选择最优提示以最大化控制流覆盖。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的JDBC连接器上评估，共报告16个问题，其中10个被官方确认，其余被认定为不安全实现。

Conclusion: 强化学习引导的大语言模型测试用例生成方法可有效检测数据库连接器的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Database connectors are critical components enabling applications to interact
with underlying database management systems (DBMS), yet their security
vulnerabilities often remain overlooked. Unlike traditional software defects,
connector vulnerabilities exhibit subtle behavioral patterns and are inherently
challenging to detect. Besides, nonstandardized implementation of connectors
leaves potential risks (a.k.a. unsafe implementations) but is more elusive. As
a result, traditional fuzzing methods are incapable of finding such
vulnerabilities. Even for LLM-enable test case generation, due to a lack of
domain knowledge, they are also incapable of generating test cases that invoke
all interface and internal logic of connectors. In this paper, we propose
reinforcement learning (RL)-guided LLM test-case generation for database
connector testing. Specifically, to equip the LLM with sufficient and
appropriate domain knowledge, a parameterized prompt template is composed which
can be utilized to generate numerous prompts. Test cases are generated via LLM
with a prompt, and are dynamically evaluated through differential testing
across multiple connectors. The testing is iteratively conducted, with each
round RL is adopted to select optimal prompt based on prior-round behavioral
feedback, so as to maximize control flow coverage. We implement aforementioned
methodology in a practical tool and evaluate it on two widely used JDBC
connectors: MySQL Connector/J and OceanBase Connector/J. In total, we reported
16 bugs, among them 10 are officially confirmed and the rest are acknowledged
as unsafe implementations.

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云游戏中云服务提供商面临提高数据中心利用率的挑战，因应用多样且游戏引擎多为单玩家设计，导致GPU利用率低。

Method: 在流行开源游戏引擎O3DE中实现Capsule机制。

Result: Capsule能容纳多达2.25倍的玩家，提高数据中心资源利用率，且不降低玩家游戏体验，对应用程序无关，可直接运行四个应用程序。

Conclusion: Capsule设计可被其他游戏引擎采用，以提高云服务提供商的数据中心利用率。

Abstract: Cloud gaming is increasingly popular. A challenge for cloud provider is to
keep datacenter utilization high: a non-trivial task due to application
variety. These applications come in different shapes and sizes. So do cloud
datacenter resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs, NPUs.
  Part of the challenge stems from game engines being predominantly designed to
run only one player. One player in a lightweight game might utilize only a
fraction of the cloud server GPU. The remaining GPU capacity will be left
underutilized, an undesired outcome for the cloud provider. We introduce
Capsule, a mechanism that allows multiple players to seamlessly share one GPU.
  We implemented Capsule in O3DE, a popular open source game engine. Our
evaluations show that Capsule can increase datacenter resource utilization by
accommodating up to 2.25x more players, without degrading player gaming
experience. Capsule is also application agnostic. We ran four applications on
Capsule-based O3DE with no application changes. Our experiences show that
Capsule design can be adopted by other game engines to increase datacenter
utilization across cloud providers.

Abstract: The recent advent of programmable switches makes distributed algorithms
readily deployable in real-world datacenter networks. However, there are still
gaps between theory and practice that prevent the smooth adaptation of CONGEST
algorithms to these environments. In this paper, we focus on the memory
restrictions that arise in real-world deployments. We introduce the
$\mu$-CONGEST model where on top of the bandwidth restriction, the memory of
nodes is also limited to $\mu$ words, in line with real-world systems. We
provide fast algorithms of two main flavors.
  First, we observe that many algorithms in the CONGEST model are
memory-intensive and do not work in $\mu$-CONGEST. A prime example of a family
of algorithms that use large memory is clique-listing algorithms. We show that
the memory issue that arises here cannot be resolved without incurring a cost
in the round complexity, by establishing a lower bound on the round complexity
of listing cliques in $\mu$-CONGEST. We introduce novel techniques to overcome
these issues and generalize the algorithms to work within a given memory bound.
Combined with our lower bound, these provide tight tradeoffs between the
running time and memory of nodes.
  Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently simulate various families
of streaming algorithms in $\mu$-CONGEST. These include fast simulations of
$p$-pass algorithms, random order streams, and various types of mergeable
streaming algorithms.
  Combining our contributions, we show that we can use streaming algorithms to
efficiently generate statistics regarding combinatorial structures in the
network. An example of an end result of this type is that we can efficiently
identify and provide the per-color frequencies of the frequent monochromatic
triangles in $\mu$-CONGEST.

Motivation: 无人机群任务面临安全威胁，现代NIDS资源需求高难部署在无人机群，需利用异构性部署NIDS。

Method: 项目分两个阶段，一是在不同嵌入式平台表征各种IDS实现；二是开发选择策略根据上下文选择最相关NIDS。

Result: 表征阶段确定36个相关IDS实现；映射阶段设计独立和分布式策略选择最佳NIDS；项目成果发表三篇国际会议论文和一篇期刊论文。

Conclusion: DISPEED项目利用无人机异构性部署NIDS的方法取得了一定成果。

Abstract: Swarms of drones are gaining more and more autonomy and efficiency during
their missions. However, security threats can disrupt their missions'
progression. To overcome this problem, Network Intrusion Detection Systems
((N)IDS) are promising solutions to detect malicious behavior on network
traffic. However, modern NIDS rely on resource-hungry machine learning
techniques, that can be difficult to deploy on a swarm of drones. The goal of
the DISPEED project is to leverage the heterogeneity (execution platforms,
memory) of the drones composing a swarm to deploy NIDS. It is decomposed in two
phases: (1) a characterization phase that consists in characterizing various
IDS implementations on diverse embedded platforms, and (2) an IDS
implementation mapping phase that seeks to develop selection strategies to
choose the most relevant NIDS depending on the context. On the one hand, the
characterization phase allowed us to identify 36 relevant IDS implementations
on three different embedded platforms: a Raspberry Pi 4B, a Jetson Xavier, and
a Pynq-Z2. On the other hand, the IDS implementation mapping phase allowed us
to design both standalone and distributed strategies to choose the best NIDSs
to deploy depending on the context. The results of the project have led to
three publications in international conferences, and one publication in a
journal.

Motivation: 解决动态模式串的字符串匹配问题，支持对模式串进行字符添加、删除等操作后统计其在文本中出现次数。

Method: 使用后缀数组设计简单实用的算法。

Result: 算法在预处理时间为O(|T|)后，更新时间达到O(log |T|)，并可扩展支持多种操作，处理在线文本时保持相同的摊还边界。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效解决动态模式串匹配问题，具有良好的时间复杂度和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle a natural variation of the String Matching Problem on
the case of a dynamic pattern, that is, given a static text $T$ and a pattern
$P$, we want to support character additions and deletions to the pattern, and
after each operation compute how many times it occurs in the text. We show a
simple and practical algorithm using Suffix Arrays that achieves $\mathcal
O(\log |T|)$ update time, after $\mathcal O(|T|)$ preprocess time. We show how
to extend our solution to support substring deletion, transposition (moving a
substring to another position of the pattern), and copy (copying a substring
and pasting it in a specific position), in the same time complexities. Our
solution can also be extended to support an online text (adding characters to
one end of the text), maintaining the same amortized bounds.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the smallest graph that contains two input
trees each with at most $n$ vertices preserving their distances. In other
words, we look for an isometric-universal graph with the minimum number of
vertices for two given trees. We prove that this problem can be solved in time
$O(n^{5/2}\log{n})$. We extend this result to forests instead of trees, and
propose an algorithm with running time $O(n^{7/2}\log{n})$. As a key
ingredient, we show that a smallest isometric-universal graph of two trees
essentially is a tree. Furthermore, we prove that these results cannot be
extended. Firstly, we show that deciding whether there exists an
isometric-universal graph with $t$ vertices for three forests is NP-complete.
Secondly, we show that any smallest isometric-universal graph cannot be a tree
for some families of three trees. This latter result has implications for
greedy strategies solving the smallest isometric-universal graph problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colinear chaining is a classical heuristic for sequence alignment and is
widely used in modern practical aligners. Jain et al. (J. Comput. Biol. 2022)
proposed an $O(n \log^3 n)$ time algorithm to chain a set of $n$ anchors so
that the chaining cost matches the edit distance of the input sequences, when
anchors are maximal exact matches. Moreover, assuming a uniform and sparse
distribution of anchors, they provided a practical solution ($\mathtt{ChainX}$)
working in $O(n \cdot \mathsf{SOL} + n \log n)$ average-case time, where
$\mathsf{SOL}$ is the cost of the output chain and $n$ is the number of anchors
in the input. This practical solution is not guaranteed to be optimal: we study
the failing cases, introduce the anchor diagonal distance, and find and
implement an optimal algorithm working in the same $O(n \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + n
\log n)$ average-case time, where $\mathsf{OPT}$ is the optimal chaining cost;
then, we validate the results by Jain et al., show that $\mathtt{ChainX}$ can
be suboptimal with a realistic long read dataset, and show minimal
computational slowdown for our solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the Global Minimum Vertex-Cut problem: given an undirected
vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a minimum-weight subset of its vertices
whose removal disconnects $G$. The problem is closely related to Global Minimum
Edge-Cut, where the weights are on the graph edges instead of vertices, and the
goal is to compute a minimum-weight subset of edges whose removal disconnects
the graph. Global Minimum Cut is one of the most basic and extensively studied
problems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. While an almost-linear
time algorithm was known for the edge version of the problem for awhile
(Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), the fastest previous algorithm for the
vertex version (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000)
achieves a running time of $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number
of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. For the special case of
unit vertex weights, this bound was broken only recently (Li {et al.}, STOC
2021); their result, combined with the recent breakthrough almost-linear time
algorithm for Maximum $s$-$t$ Flow (Chen {et al.}, FOCS 2022, van den Brand {et
al.}, FOCS 2023), yields an almost-linear time algorithm for Global Minimum
Vertex-Cut with unit vertex weights.
  In this paper we break the $28$ years old bound of Henzinger {et al.} for the
general weighted Global Minimum Vertex-Cut, by providing a randomized algorithm
for the problem with running time $O(\min\{mn^{0.99+o(1)},m^{1.5+o(1)}\})$.

Motivation: 现有高效索引结构的实际构建存在瓶颈，尤其是复杂组件recompression RLSLP的构建。

Method: 基于输入的类LZ77近似表示，在压缩时间内构建recompression RLSLP。

Result: 在大型重复输入上，相比现有未压缩时间方法，速度提升达46倍，内存使用降低17倍。

Conclusion: 此成果提高了对更大数据集的可扩展性，证明压缩计算是快速索引构建的可行途径。

Abstract: Compressed indexing enables powerful queries over massive and repetitive
textual datasets using space proportional to the compressed input. While
theoretical advances have led to highly efficient index structures, their
practical construction remains a bottleneck (especially for complex components
like recompression RLSLP), a grammar-based representation crucial for building
powerful text indexes that support widely used suffix array queries.
  In this work, we present the first implementation of recompression RLSLP
construction that runs in compressed time, operating on an LZ77-like
approximation of the input. Compared to state-of-the-art uncompressed-time
methods, our approach achieves up to 46$\times$ speedup and 17$\times$ lower
RAM usage on large, repetitive inputs. These gains unlock scalability to larger
datasets and affirm compressed computation as a practical path forward for fast
index construction.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

Method: 提出RefRank方法，基于固定参考文档，让大语言模型根据共享参考锚评估候选文档，通过选择能概括核心查询意图的参考锚间接比较文档，还使用加权平均方案聚合多个输出。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和不同大语言模型上的实验表明，RefRank显著优于Pointwise基线，性能至少与Pairwise方法相当且计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: RefRank是一种简单有效的比较排序方法，能在降低计算成本的同时保留比较评估的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in the
task of text ranking for information retrieval. While Pointwise ranking
approaches offer computational efficiency by scoring documents independently,
they often yield biased relevance estimates due to the lack of inter-document
comparisons. In contrast, Pairwise methods improve ranking accuracy by
explicitly comparing document pairs, but suffer from substantial computational
overhead with quadratic complexity ($O(n^2)$). To address this tradeoff, we
propose \textbf{RefRank}, a simple and effective comparative ranking method
based on a fixed reference document. Instead of comparing all document pairs,
RefRank prompts the LLM to evaluate each candidate relative to a shared
reference anchor. By selecting the reference anchor that encapsulates the core
query intent, RefRank implicitly captures relevance cues, enabling indirect
comparison between documents via this common anchor. This reduces computational
cost to linear time ($O(n)$) while importantly, preserving the advantages of
comparative evaluation. To further enhance robustness, we aggregate multiple
RefRank outputs using a weighted averaging scheme across different reference
choices. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and with various LLMs show
that RefRank significantly outperforms Pointwise baselines and could achieve
performance at least on par with Pairwise approaches with a significantly lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: 引入的参考模型和模式有助于简化组织数据集成中的信息提取流程。

Abstract: With the advent of digital transformation, organisations are increasingly
generating large volumes of data through the execution of various processes
across disparate systems. By integrating data from these heterogeneous sources,
it becomes possible to derive new insights essential for tasks such as
monitoring and analysing process performance. Typically, this information is
extracted during a data pre-processing or engineering phase. However, this step
is often performed in an ad-hoc manner and is time-consuming and
labour-intensive. To streamline this process, we introduce a reference model
and a collection of patterns designed to enrich production event data. The
reference model provides a standard way for storing and extracting production
event data. The patterns describe common information extraction tasks and how
such tasks can be automated effectively. The reference model is developed by
combining the ISA-95 industry standard with the Event Knowledge Graph
formalism. The patterns are developed based on empirical observations from
event data sets originating in manufacturing processes and are formalised using
the reference model. We evaluate the relevance and applicability of these
patterns by demonstrating their application to use cases.

Conclusion: DMICF能有效解决现有方法的局限性，提升推荐准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Disentangling user intentions from implicit feedback has become a promising
strategy to enhance recommendation accuracy and interpretability. Prior methods
often model intentions independently and lack explicit supervision, thus
failing to capture the joint semantics that drive user-item interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose DMICF, a unified framework that
explicitly models interaction-level intent alignment while leveraging
structural signals from both user and item perspectives. DMICF adopts a
dual-view architecture that jointly encodes user-item interaction graphs from
both sides, enabling bidirectional information fusion. This design enhances
robustness under data sparsity by allowing the structural redundancy of one
view to compensate for the limitations of the other. To model fine-grained
user-item compatibility, DMICF introduces an intent interaction encoder that
performs sub-intent alignment within each view, uncovering shared semantic
structures that underlie user decisions. This localized alignment enables
adaptive refinement of intent embeddings based on interaction context, thus
improving the model's generalization and expressiveness, particularly in
long-tail scenarios. Furthermore, DMICF integrates an intent-aware scoring
mechanism that aggregates compatibility signals from matched intent pairs
across user and item subspaces, enabling personalized prediction grounded in
semantic congruence rather than entangled representations. To facilitate
semantic disentanglement, we design a discriminative training signal via
multi-negative sampling and softmax normalization, which pulls together
semantically aligned intent pairs while pushing apart irrelevant or noisy ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMICF consistently delivers robust
performance across datasets with diverse interaction distributions.

Motivation: 传统NLP方法在识别复杂、隐式因果关系，尤其是低数据场景下存在困难，需要新方法解决。

Method: 将新闻标题转换为因果知识图，采用混合检索系统结合语义嵌入和图结构线索，通过三阶段管道（数据准备、图检索、大语言模型推理）处理。

Result: 使用20个少样本示例进行因果分类，F1分数达到82.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高准确性和一致性，适用于新闻可靠性评估、错误信息检测和政策分析等实时应用。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.

Conclusion: TongSearch QR模型推理性能好，推理成本低，具有更好的实际部署适应性。

Abstract: Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods excel at textual and semantic
matching but struggle in reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks that require
multi-hop inference or complex semantic understanding between queries and
documents. One promising solution is to explicitly rewrite or augment queries
using large language models (LLMs) to elicit reasoning-relevant content prior
to retrieval. However, the widespread use of large-scale language models like
GPT-4 or LLaMA3-70B remains impractical due to their high inference cost and
limited deployability in real-world systems. In this work, we introduce
TongSearch QR (Previously Known as "TongSearch Reasoner"), a family of
small-scale language models for query reasoning and rewriting in
reasoning-intensive retrieval. With a novel semi-rule-based reward function, we
employ reinforcement learning approaches enabling smaller language models, e,g,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, to achieve query reasoning
performance rivaling large-scale language models without their prohibitive
inference costs. Experiment results on BRIGHT benchmark show that with BM25 as
retrievers, both TongSearch QR-7B and TongSearch QR-1.5B models significantly
outperform existing baselines, including prompt-based query reasoners and some
latest dense retrievers trained for reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks,
offering superior adaptability for real-world deployment.

Result: 发现排名参数在视频召回和精度上有差异，存在严重时间衰减，搜索结果缺乏一致性，影响研究结果。

Conclusion: API搜索功能优先考虑‘新鲜度’而非全面检索，不适合稳健学术研究，尤其不符合数字服务法案要求。

Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3),
a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over
six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding
completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal
substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in
terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous
off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable
videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from
the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs.
Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding
different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the
European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research
outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes
that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing "freshness" over
comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research,
especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐基础模型常忽视嵌入任务，且在多任务学习方面存在知识共享与冲突解决、收敛速度不一致等问题。

Method: 构建涵盖生成和嵌入任务的综合数据集，提出含TMoLE、S2Sched和模型合并模块的多任务训练方案。

Result: RecFound在各种推荐任务中达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有的基线。

Conclusion: RecFound框架能够有效解决现有推荐基础模型的局限性，提升推荐任务的性能。

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Result: 发现计算和基础数据科学存在严重分化威胁。

Conclusion: 采用严格方法衡量数据宇宙发现的有用性可缓解分化。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Motivation: 基础模型集中训练有隐私和传输成本问题，PFL研究多在模拟环境，未考虑现实场景的数据和模型异质性。

Result: 在多模态PFL新基准上进行评估，所提方法优于现有技术，在个性化和泛化能力上表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的考虑数据和模型异质性的方法在多模态PFL中有效，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习中需学习未知物理过程并跨时空尺度预测，传统模型缺乏物理可解释性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ASNO架构，结合空间和时间交互的可分离注意力机制，受BDF启发学习用于时间预测和外推的变压器及处理外部负载的注意力神经算子。

Result: 在SciML基准测试中，ASNO性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ASNO在工程应用、物理发现和可解释机器学习方面有潜力。

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

Result: 架构设计起关键作用，扩散模型效用最高（宏F1达88.2%），CTGAN抗重建攻击能力最强。

Conclusion: 结构化生成模型在开发保护隐私、数据驱动的能源系统方面有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高亲和力的蛋白质结合蛋白在生物医学和生物技术中至关重要，但为任意蛋白质靶点按需创建高亲和力结合剂且无需大量湿实验测试仍是挑战。

Method: 基于SSINC网络构建PPDiff，整合交错自注意力层、kNN等变图层和因果注意力层；创建PPBench数据集，对模型进行预训练和在两个实际应用中微调。

Result: PPDiff在预训练任务和两个下游应用中的成功率分别为50.00%、23.16%和16.89%，始终超越基线方法。

Conclusion: PPDiff是一种有效的为任意蛋白质靶点设计结合剂的方法。

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,

Result: 以Prolog为例，模型在训练后能生成逻辑一致、语法准确的代码，实验评估显示推理质量、代码准确性和逻辑正确性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力让缺乏大量训练资源的多种编程语言受益。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Conclusion: 为传染病预测模型中的流动性表示提供新视角，帮助决策者更好应对未来疫情。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Conclusion: 提出的联合框架有效，YingLong模型性能优越，具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

Conclusion: 新的主动学习策略和流训练工作流有效，可减少训练数据和时间。

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

Motivation: 传统BP算法在生物和硬件视角存在关键局限，如对称权重反向误差传播、非局部信用分配等。

Method: 提出Forward Target Propagation (FTP)算法，用第二次前向传播替代反向传播，仅通过前馈计算估计每层目标。

Result: 在全连接网络、CNN、RNN上评估，在MNIST、CIFAR10等数据集上准确率与BP相当，能有效建模序列任务长期依赖，在量化低精度和新兴硬件约束下优于BP，比其他生物启发方法更高效。

Conclusion: FTP计算开销小、仅前向传播且硬件兼容，为节能设备端学习和神经形态计算提供有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像生成器生成的图像愈发逼真，监督检测依赖大量数据集且泛化能力差，因此探索预训练视觉语言模型的零样本检测方法。

Method: 采用任务对齐提示（零样本 - s²），在模型响应前添加特定短语，还评估了不同模型大小及自一致性。

Result: 零样本 - s²使Macro F1分数提升8% - 29%，在多个数据集和模型上有良好泛化性，自一致性也有效，且多数情况下比思维链方法表现好。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发预训练视觉语言模型更聚焦的推理，增强其潜在能力，是监督方法的简单、可泛化且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

*Minjae Kwon,Tyler Ingebrand,Ufuk Topcu,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种用于强化学习的运行时屏蔽机制，可降低安全违规，实现强泛化且运行开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数变化会在执行期间带来安全风险。

Method: 基于受限隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，屏蔽机制通过预测安全风险约束动作空间并利用共形预测处理不确定性。

Result: 证明机制满足概率安全保证，在安全合规策略集中产生最优策略，实验表明可显著减少安全违规，实现强泛化且运行开销小。

Conclusion: 该机制能有效应对隐藏参数变化带来的安全风险。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Conclusion: LPK能捕捉训练轨迹，适应数据和优化动态，给出更紧且信息丰富的泛化保证，梯度范数影响最终泛化性能。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

Result: 展示了当前开源LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的优势和不足。

Conclusion: 该基准能揭示现有模型缺点，为提升LVLMs视觉因果推理能力提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出可微的Tversky相似度参数化方法，实验表明Tversky投影层可替代线性投影层，还给出统一解释和可视化技术，提供深度学习相似度模型新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中标准的几何相似度模型不符合人类感知，Tversky的相似度理论未用于深度学习，需解决离散集合操作融入的挑战。

Method: 开发可通过梯度下降学习的Tversky相似度可微参数化方法，推导Tversky投影层等神经网络构建模块。

Result: 在图像识别和语言建模实验中，Tversky投影层能有效替代线性投影层，如在NABirds任务上提升准确率，降低GPT - 2困惑度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 为深度学习中的相似度模型提供新范式，可设计在既定心理相似度理论下具有可解释性的网络。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决现有文本图像行人重识别方法的问题，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

TL;DR: 论文指出LTV预测存在数据少和任务相关性强的问题，提出GRePO - LTV框架解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实广告场景中LTV预测因数据少和任务相关性强带来的挑战，精准的LTV预测能为广告商带来利润。

Method: 先使用图表示学习解决数据稀缺问题，再用帕累托优化处理预测任务的相互依赖关系。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论，但表明提出GRePO - LTV框架可全面解决相关挑战。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MoTE框架能有效缓解任务间输出维度不一致导致的校准错误，且提出的适配器受限的MoTE有一定意义。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

Conclusion: 提出的通用约简矩阵概念有助于降低RSA，对图神经网络性能有影响，可应用于图节点分类任务。

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Motivation: 解决CFG在高指导权重下生成图像出现明显颜色失真的问题。

Method: 提出理论框架解释CFG导致的规范放大和异常扩散现象，基于理论见解和潜在空间结构提出ADG算法，约束幅度变化同时优化角度对齐。

Result: 实验表明ADG显著优于现有方法，生成图像文本对齐度高、颜色保真度好且更符合人类感知偏好。

Conclusion: ADG算法能在保持高文本图像对齐度的同时有效缓解颜色失真问题。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Result: 在USPTO数据集上，ChemHGNN显著优于HGNN和GNN基线模型，尤其在大规模场景下。

Conclusion: HGNN是反应虚拟筛选和发现中GNN的优越替代方案，可加速反应发现。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Result: 在VTAB - 1K、FGVC和GLUE基准测试中，GenFT优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: GenFT简单有效，为高效模型适配提供新视角。

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Conclusion: pLSTMs在处理DAG和多维数据上有优势，是一种有效的模型，代码和数据集公开可获取。

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Motivation: 大语言模型工具使用代理的工具使用训练数据策划是开放问题，现有合成数据生成方法有缺陷。

Method: 引入RandomWorld流程来程序生成交互式工具和组合工具使用数据，并通过SFT和RL对模型进行调优。

Result: 在一系列工具使用基准上有改进，在NESTFUL数据集两个指标上创最佳成绩，下游性能随训练数据量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 使用完全合成数据进一步提升性能是可能的。

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large
language models (LLMs), particularly in the widely used closed-source models.
Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Conclusion: 复值架构在低信噪比环境频谱感知中能提高弱信号检测和训练效率。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The
dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/hcc1-6p22

Motivation: 现有电力价格预测方法依赖数值历史，忽略同期文本信号，需要新基准评估模型。

Method: 引入NSW - EPNews基准，包含价格、温度和新闻数据，以48步超前预测为任务，采用多模态输入评估传统模型和LLMs。

Result: 传统统计和机器学习模型从新闻特征获益小，LLMs有一定性能提升但常产生幻觉。

Conclusion: NSW - EPNews为多模态数值推理提供测试平台，指出当前LLM能力与高风险能源预测需求存在差距。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

Conclusion: BYB策略有效，能提升模型性能，降低蚂蚁集团坏账风险。

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

Conclusion: 所提方法能从优化器轨迹生成领域抽象层面可被人类理解的解释。

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Conclusion: 提出的STRCMP框架有效提升了组合优化问题的求解质量和效率。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Result: 实验表明该方法大幅超越最佳基线，在AIME2024和GQA任务中分别比Delta - CoMe高22.3%和6.1%。

Conclusion: ADAMIX框架有效，能在满足压缩率要求下最小化量化误差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

Result: PFP成功缓解在线学习中偏好特征的偏差。

Conclusion: PFP在评估大语言模型对齐的标准基准上比先前偏好学习方法性能更优。

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

TL;DR: 提出PromptTSS框架用于多粒度状态的时间序列分割，实验显示其在多方面提升效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割方法无法在统一模型中处理多粒度，且对动态环境新模式适应性有限，而多粒度状态分割在预测维护和性能优化等任务中很关键。

Method: 提出PromptTSS框架，使用带提示机制的统一模型，利用标签和边界信息引导分割。

Result: PromptTSS在多粒度分割中准确率提高24.49%，单粒度分割中提高17.88%，迁移学习中最高提高599.24%。

Conclusion: PromptTSS能适应分层状态和不断变化的时间序列动态。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视数据覆盖不足带来的安全风险，且单步分析与离线强化学习多步决策本质不符。

Method: 引入序列级集中度系数量化覆盖度；将状态 - 动作对转换为决策单元，提取多步行为的代表性决策模式，找出可能导致覆盖不足的罕见模式并进行毒化。

Result: 毒化仅1%的数据集就能使智能体性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 为分析和保障离线强化学习的安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential
for robust, real-world clinical deployment.

Motivation: 多数研究集中于静态环境下的即时偏差，本文旨在研究动态决策系统中的长期公平性并兼顾即时公平要求。

Method: 在强化学习中提出通用框架，通过因果视角将衡量长期公平的指标分解为三个分量，并分析其与利益公平的联系。

Result: 分析了各分量与利益公平概念的内在联系。

Conclusion: 开发出一种简单有效的平衡多种公平概念的方法。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Method: 从四个维度评估TSFMs：零样本单变量预测泛化性、带协变量的热行为建模预测、零样本表征学习用于分类任务、对性能指标和不同操作条件的鲁棒性。

Result: TSFMs泛化性有限，单变量预测略优于统计模型；包含协变量未提升性能，不如传统模型；能生成有效零样本表征，但预测可能不如统计模型；预测性能对评估指标敏感，在复杂环境表现差。

Conclusion: 需要针对性改进TSFM设计，如处理协变量、融入上下文和时间动态，以开发更适用和可扩展的BEM解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

Result: 显著提升不同架构和数据模态下的组鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架是解决虚假关联问题可扩展且有原则的方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: 评估图的抗噪算法时应纳入EDN，以提高噪声环境下图学习的可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Result: 对于精确分数函数，随机性可减少KL散度；对于近似分数函数，随机性对性能的影响取决于分数误差结构。

Conclusion: 随机性在分数扩散模型生成过程中作用复杂，不同情况下对性能影响不同。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

Method: 提出SSTI攻击，在三个家族模型和四个不同数据集上应用该攻击进行实验。

Result: 发现一个SSTI令牌就能控制模型决策；轻度SSTI下，对虚假令牌的依赖与LoRA秩成正比；激进SSTI时，较大LoRA秩值使模型关注非虚假令牌，提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT存在使模型依赖捷径解的问题，SSTI攻击可控制模型行为，不同情况下LoRA秩值对模型有不同影响。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

Conclusion: 联邦学习现有防御存在关键盲点，标准防御机制可能意外放大数据泄露。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Result: TruncQuant在不同位宽设置下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TruncQuant是一种可在运行时通过移位实现灵活位精度、易于实现的训练方案。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Motivation: 现有非结构化稀疏在现代硬件上难以实现实际加速，为解决该问题提出DynaDiag方法。

Method: 提出DynaDiag方法，在训练中强制对角稀疏模式，保留前向和反向传播的稀疏计算，并通过自定义CUDA内核加速计算。

Result: 在不同神经架构上的实证评估表明，该方法能保持与非结构化方法相当的精度，在ViTs中90%稀疏线性层可实现最高3.13倍在线推理加速和1.59倍GPU训练加速。

Conclusion: DynaDiag方法是硬件友好的，能在不牺牲模型性能的前提下获得显著计算加速。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

Conclusion: 恢复合作动态对于增强广泛部署的多模态Transformer的更广泛能力至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Conclusion: 此工作为数据高效的强化学习后训练提供有价值见解，为优化推理数据选择的未来研究奠定基础，并将发布代码。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to
avert or mitigate the severe health complications of this disease. Over recent
years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising potential in predicting
diabetes risk and are beneficial for practitioners. Objective: This study
highlights the prediction capabilities of statistical and non-statistical
machine learning methods over Diabetes risk classification in 768 samples from
the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of the significant demographic
and clinical features of age, body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels
that greatly depend on the vulnerability against Diabetes. The experimentation
assesses the various types of machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy
and effectiveness regarding diabetes prediction. These algorithms include
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and Neural Network Models. The
results show that the Neural Network algorithm gained the highest predictive
accuracy with 78,57 %, and then the Random Forest algorithm had the second
position with 76,30 % accuracy. These findings show that machine learning
techniques are not just highly effective. Still, they also can potentially act
as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health

Conclusion: 机器学习可替代当前主观VUR评估，肾盏变形是严重病例强预测因子，未来应扩大数据集等。

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Conclusion: 倡导采用基于时间序列原语的对齐范式进行时间序列推理，对相关文献分类并指出有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Conclusion: Delayformer能克服高维系统变量预测中的非线性和交叉交互问题，具有广泛适用性，可作为基础时间序列模型。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

Conclusion: 多模态数据重混方法有效，能解决多模态学习中的问题。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

Motivation: GNN易受攻击，现有防御方法有依赖启发式指标、过拟合及计算复杂等问题。

Result: KCES增强GNN鲁棒性，超越现有基线，提升现有防御效果。

Conclusion: KCES为保障GNN安全提供了有原则且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Conclusion: 增进对紧急失准机制的理解，有助于更广泛地理解和缓解模型失准问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Conclusion: SSPINNpose有潜力成为实验室和野外环境实时生物力学分析的可扩展和适应性解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

Conclusion: 应谨慎解读基于扰动的指标，需重新审视归因评估内容并开发更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Conclusion: 所提方法在估算概率值方面达到了最优性能。

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular
networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By
integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an
attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our
reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in
vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our
approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation
process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention
mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC
services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved
from 71.44% to 73.21%.

TL;DR: 本文研究Mamba中输入选择性的作用，通过理论证明和实验结果揭示其在函数逼近、长期记忆和联想回忆能力方面的影响，为理解和改进Mamba提供依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽Mamba性能优于其SSM前身，但不清楚其如何利用输入选择性的额外功能及与其他操作的交互，因此要揭秘输入选择性的作用。

Method: 证明Mamba的S6层可表示哈尔小波投影；展示S6层如何动态抵消记忆衰减；为不同混合器的Mamba架构解决MQAR联想回忆任务提供解析解。

Result: 证明S6层在逼近不连续函数上优于S4D；展示S6层能动态抵消记忆衰减；给出不同混合器架构的解析解，并通过实验验证理论结构的紧密性。

Conclusion: 研究为Mamba提供了机械理解，并揭示了改进机会。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Result: 该方法在白盒场景下（如快速梯度法和投影梯度下降攻击）优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法有潜力保护Transformer免受对抗样本可迁移性的影响。

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在解决逆问题时难以正确融合先验和测量中的冲突信号，尤其是在非高斯或未知噪声场景。

Method: 提出Measurement - Aligned Sampling (MAS)框架，统一并扩展现有方法，提供新优化视角。

Result: 广泛实验表明，MAS在一系列任务中始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAS框架可以更灵活地平衡先验和测量信息，能处理已知高斯噪声、未知或非高斯噪声类型。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Motivation: 树搜索在传统推理任务表现好，但在策略大语言模型强化学习中研究不足，且现有方法训练独立过程奖励模型有分布不匹配和奖励破解问题。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，包含中间监督，无需单独训练奖励模型；引入高性价比树搜索方法，从高不确定性中间步骤策略性分支。

Result: 在数学和代码推理基准测试中，TreeRL性能优于传统ChainRL。

Conclusion: 凸显了树搜索在大语言模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Result: XAStruct可预测XAS光谱和推断局部结构描述符，独立训练保证了最优准确性和特定任务性能。

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中策略混淆问题，即策略影响观测变量形成反馈回路，阻碍智能体泛化能力。

Method: 使用优势函数调整动作值，降低当前策略下更可能出现的状态 - 动作对的权重。

Result: 通过分析和实证证明使用优势函数训练能提升轨迹外性能。

Conclusion: 优势函数可减轻策略混淆影响，改善智能体泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Result: 在野生无标签图像（如EpicKitchens视频数据、COCO场景数据、CC12M网络爬取数据）上训练时，能得到更好的特征表示。

Conclusion: 将无标签图像预训练视为强化学习问题的方法可行且有效。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Conclusion: 该方法有可扩展的ML驱动交通管理潜力。

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Conclusion: EMLoC框架灵活且实用，能为个人用户带来高效的模型适配。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Conclusion: 所提出的设计方法能在减少控制开销的同时，优化能源和面积利用，适用于大规模神经形态架构。

Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that
communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in
these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural
activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high
traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle
high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among
the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained
attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency.
Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is
essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently
with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a
scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim
of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We
evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software
simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design
process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the
data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

Conclusion: FeNN适合在FPGA上模拟SNN，可与标准计算机应用集成。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the

Abstract: Smart buildings are gaining popularity because they can enhance energy
efficiency, lower costs, improve security, and provide a more comfortable and
convenient environment for building occupants. A considerable portion of the
global energy supply is consumed in the building sector and plays a pivotal
role in future decarbonization pathways. To manage energy consumption and
improve energy efficiency in smart buildings, developing reliable and accurate
energy demand forecasting is crucial and meaningful. However, extending an
effective predictive model for the total energy use of appliances at the
building level is challenging because of temporal oscillations and complex
linear and non-linear patterns. This paper proposes three hybrid ensemble
predictive models, incorporating Bagging, Stacking, and Voting mechanisms
combined with a fast and effective evolutionary hyper-parameters tuner. The
performance of the proposed energy forecasting model was evaluated using a
hybrid dataset comprising meteorological parameters, appliance energy use,
temperature, humidity, and lighting energy consumption from various sections of
a building, collected by 18 sensors located in Stambroek, Mons, Belgium. To
provide a comparative framework and investigate the efficiency of the proposed
predictive model, 15 popular machine learning (ML) models, including two
classic ML models, three NNs, a Decision Tree (DT), a Random Forest (RF), two
Deep Learning (DL) and six Ensemble models, were compared. The prediction
results indicate that the adaptive evolutionary bagging model surpassed other
predictive models in both accuracy and learning error. Notably, it achieved
accuracy gains of 12.6%, 13.7%, 12.9%, 27.04%, and 17.4% compared to Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGB), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), GBM, LGBM, and Random
Forest (RF).

*Roberto Vergallo,Luís Cruz,Alessio Errico,Luca Mainetti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过实验验证Follow - the - Sun (FtS)策略减少AI工作负载碳足迹的效果，发现该策略能减少碳排放并保留训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能功耗大，FtS被提出用于减少AI模型训练的碳足迹，但缺乏科学证据支持其优势，为填补此研究空白开展实验。

Method: 在部分合成场景下，对异常检测领域的四种AI算法进行基准测试，利用2021年七个欧洲城市的历史碳强度数据，对比无策略、FtS和另外两种现有策略下的碳排放差异。

Result: FtS策略平均可减少高达14.6%的碳排放（峰值16.3%），且有助于保留训练所需时间。

Conclusion: FtS策略能有效减少AI工作负载的碳足迹，同时保障训练时间。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

TL;DR: 研究将CoD方法拓展到软件工程，实验表明CoD变体比CoT更省令牌，能减少处理时间和成本，且代码质量保持在90%以上，为优化LLM开发工作流提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型处理复杂代码任务需冗长中间推理，导致高延迟和成本，需更高效方法。

Method: 将Chain of Draft (CoD)方法拓展到软件工程，设计并评估多种适用于代码任务的CoD变体，在SWE - bench基准的300个样本上进行实验。

Result: CoD变体比CoT使用令牌显著减少，Baseline CoD最有效，处理时间和API成本约降45%，代码质量保持在CoT的90%以上。

Conclusion: 特定领域特征影响提示策略有效性，研究为软件工程应用提供平衡效率与解决方案质量的框架，指导根据项目需求选择提示策略优化工作流。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become vital tools for software
development, but they often require verbose intermediate reasoning for complex
code tasks, leading to high latency and costs. This research extends the Chain
of Draft (CoD) method to software engineering, designing and evaluating
multiple CoD variants tailored for code tasks. Through comprehensive
experiments on all 300 samples from the SWE-bench benchmark, we found that all
CoD variants used significantly fewer tokens than Chain of Thought (CoT), with
Baseline CoD being most efficient at 55.4% of CoT's tokens. While this
represents substantial efficiency gains - translating to approximately 45%
reduction in processing time and API costs - it differs from the extreme 7.6%
reported in the original CoD paper for mathematical reasoning. This difference
stems from the inherent complexity and context-dependency of software tasks,
which require more detailed reasoning to maintain solution quality. Our
multi-dimensional quality assessment revealed that CoD variants maintain over
90% of CoT's code quality across key metrics including correctness,
compatibility, and maintainability, making them practical alternatives for
real-world development scenarios where efficiency matters. This research
demonstrates how domain-specific characteristics influence prompting strategy
effectiveness and provides a framework for balancing efficiency with solution
quality in software engineering applications. Our findings offer practical
guidance for optimizing LLM-based development workflows through appropriate
prompting strategy selection based on project requirements.

Method: 提出YOTO框架，通过参数融合集成多种漏洞检测模型，无需联合训练。

Result: YOTO能快速适应新发现的漏洞。

Conclusion: YOTO框架显著减少了模型更新所需的时间和计算资源。

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel prompting approach aimed at enhancing the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate accurate Python code.
Specifically, we introduce a prompt template designed to improve the quality

produce reliable results. Through experiments conducted on two state-of-the-art
LLMs using the HumanEval dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
widely studied zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in terms of the
Pass@k metric. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements with
significantly reduced token usage compared to the CoT approach, making it both
effective and resource-efficient, thereby lowering the computational demands
and improving the eco-footprint of LLM capabilities. These findings highlight
the potential of tailored prompting strategies to optimize code generation
performance, paving the way for broader applications in AI-driven programming
tasks.

Abstract: Many organizations strive to increase the level of automation in their
business processes. While automation historically was mainly concerned with
automating physical labor, current automation efforts mostly focus on
automation in a digital manner, thus targeting work that is related to the
interaction between humans and computers. This type of automation, commonly
referred to as business process automation, has many facets. Yet, academic
literature mainly focuses on Robotic Process Automation, a specific automation
capability. Recognizing that leading vendors offer automation capabilities
going way beyond that, we use this paper to develop a detailed understanding of
business process automation in industry. To this end, we conduct a structured
market analysis of the 18 predominant vendors of business process automation
solutions as identified by Gartner. As a result, we provide a comprehensive
overview of the business process automation capabilities currently offered by
industrial vendors. We show which types and facets of automation exist and
which aspects represent promising directions for the future.

technology, process participants, process managers, and software developers.
This paper offers insights and recommendations that can help organizations

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,

Method: 提出model discovery自动化CI/CD步骤提取实时依赖图，用DeathStarBench Social Network构建图，通过蒙特卡罗模拟故障并在真实系统进行混沌实验。

Result: 无复制时16次试验观察到的弹性为0.186，预测为0.161；有复制时观察和预测值收敛到0.305，平均绝对误差≤0.0004。

Conclusion: 简单自动发现的图能高保真估计微服务可用性，无需全面故障测试即可在设计时快速洞察。

Abstract: Microservice applications are prone to cascading failures because of dense
inter-service dependencies. Ensuring resilience usually demands fault-injection
experiments in production-like setups. We propose \textit{model discovery} --
an automated CI/CD step that extracts a live dependency graph from trace data
-- and show that this lightweight representation is sufficient for accurate
resilience prediction. Using the DeathStarBench Social Network, we build the
graph, simulate failures via Monte-Carlo, and run matching chaos experiments on
the real system. The graph model closely matches reality: with no replication,
16 trials yield an observed resilience of 0.186 versus a predicted 0.161; with
replication, both observed and predicted values converge to 0.305 (mean
absolute error \leq 0.0004). These results indicate that even a simple,
automatically discovered graph can estimate microservice availability with high
fidelity, offering rapid design-time insight without full-scale failure
testing.

Abstract: Digital twins are becoming powerful tools in industrial applications,
offering virtual representations of cyber-physical systems. However,
verification of these models remains a significant challenge due to the
potentially large datasets used by the digital twin. This paper introduces an
innovative methodology for verifying neural network-based digital twin models,
in a black-box fashion, by integrating model checking into the process. The
latter relies on defining and applying system-level contracts that capture the
system's requirements, to verify the behavior of digital twin models,
implemented in Simulink. We develop an automated solution that simulates the
digital twin model for certain inputs, and feeds the predicted outputs together
with the inputs to the contract model described as a network of timed automata
in the UPPAAL model checker. The latter verifies whether the predicted outputs
fulfill the specified contracts. This approach allows us to identify scenarios
where the digital twin's behavior fails to meet the contracts, without
requiring the digital twin's design technicalities. We apply our method to a
boiler system case study for which we identify prediction errors via contract
verification. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating model
checking with digital twin models for continuous improvement.

ineffective at these skills, which is detrimental to project success.
Project-based university courses are an opportunity for students to practise

To do this, we will first evaluate the suitability of social network analysis
techniques for identifying areas of improvement in teams' communication. Then,
we will develop features in a project management tool that aid students in
identifying and addressing these areas of improvement, and evaluate them in the
context of a software engineering group project.

Method: 基于五个数据集（BigCloneBench、CodeJam、Karnalim、POJ104、PoolC）和六个代码模型（CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT、Salesforce T5、UniXCoder、PLBART、Polycoder）进行评估。

Result: 多数模型在标准指标（准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数）上表现良好，但部分代码克隆仍难检测。

Conclusion: 新小代码模型在代码克隆分类上有一定效果，但存在部分特殊克隆检测难题。

Abstract: Detecting code clones is relevant to software maintenance and code
refactoring. This challenge still presents unresolved cases, mainly when
structural similarity does not reflect functional equivalence, though recent
code models show promise. Therefore, this research aims to systematically
measure the performance of several newly introduced small code models in
classifying code pairs as clones or non-clones. The evaluation is based on five
datasets: BigCloneBench, CodeJam, Karnalim, POJ104, and PoolC, as well as six
code models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Salesforce T5, UniXCoder, PLBART, and
Polycoder. Most models performed well across standard metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, a marginal fraction of
clones remains challenging to detect, especially when the code looks similar
but performs different operations. The source code that illustrates our
approach is available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a formal theory of verification and validation (V&V)
within systems engineering, grounded in the axiom that V&V are fundamentally
knowledge-building activities. Using dynamic epistemic modal logic, we develop
precise definitions of verification and validation, articulating their roles in
confirming and contextualizing knowledge about systems. The theory formalizes
the interplay between epistemic states, evidence, and reasoning processes,
allowing for the derivation of theorems that clarify the conceptual
underpinnings of V&V. By providing a formal foundation, this work addresses
ambiguities in traditional V&V practices, offering a structured framework to
enhance precision and consistency in systems engineering methodologies. The
insights gained have implications for both academic research and practical
applications, fostering a deeper understanding of V&V as critical components of
engineering knowledge generation.

*Kangping Xu,Yifan Luo,Yang Yuan,Andrew Chi-Chih Yao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出用函数式编程和类型系统将Scala后端代码转为Lean表示，用LLM证明定理验证代码，可自动化部分测试工作且成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化测试方法存在测试局部性、缺乏通用可靠性和业务逻辑盲目性等局限，难以媲美人类工程师。

Method: 提出框架将Scala后端代码转为Lean表示，自动生成定理并使用LLM证明器验证。

Result: 能正式验证超50%测试需求，每个API平均成本仅2.19美元，比手动测试更具成本效益且可并行扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的AI软件测试指明方向，有望随模型发展提高工程生产力。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出框架和工具验证COBOL转Java代码等价性，能修复代码并反馈改进AI模型，用符号执行生成测试用例检查语义等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的自动代码转换结果虽好，但转换后的代码正确性存疑，需要验证COBOL和Java代码的等价性。

Method: 开发基于符号执行的测试用例生成方法为COBOL程序自动生成单元测试，模拟外部资源调用，生成等价JUnit测试用例运行以检查语义等价。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 可验证代码等价性，能修复代码并为AI模型提供反馈以改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

TL;DR: 提出E - Test方法来增量扩充测试套件，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为维持长期使用的软件系统质量，需用反映软件实际使用情况的测试用例扩充测试套件。

Method: 利用大语言模型识别已测试、未测试和易出错的单元执行场景，据此扩充测试套件。

Result: E - Test在识别测试不足的行为和优化测试套件方面优于主流的现有方法。

Conclusion: E - Test方法是有效的，可用于扩充测试套件。

Abstract: Augmenting test suites with test cases that reflect the actual usage of the
software system is extremely important to sustain the quality of long lasting
software systems. In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that
incrementally augments a test suite with test cases that exercise behaviors
that emerge in production and that are not been tested yet. E-Test leverages
Large Language Models to identify already-tested, not-yet-tested, and
error-prone unit execution scenarios, and augment the test suite accordingly.
Our experimental evaluation shows that E-Test outperforms the main
state-of-the-art approaches to identify inadequately tested behaviors and
optimize test suites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能虽将革新军事作战系统，但当前技术就绪评估无法捕捉AI特定关键因素，部署存在潜在风险。

Method: 提出类似传统技术就绪水平但针对AI扩展的新AI就绪框架，利用现有数据评估工具和测试实践。

Result: 证明了该框架近期实施的可行性。

Conclusion: 该结构化方法能让军事决策者了解AI系统是否达部署标准，推动国防技术管理和风险评估领域发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

Motivation: ESE研究中良好写作实践少被讨论记录，但却是评审标准，为写作有困扰者提供指导。

Method: 无明确提及具体方法，主要是给出主观写作建议。

Result: 无明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 以这种方式撰写论文对作者有效，希望指南对他人也有一定作用。

Abstract: While mastered by some, good scientific writing practices within Empirical
Software Engineering (ESE) research appear to be seldom discussed and
documented. Despite this, these practices are implicit or even explicit
evaluation criteria of typical software engineering conferences and journals.
In this pragmatic, educational-first document, we want to provide guidance to
those who may feel overwhelmed or confused by writing ESE papers, but also
those more experienced who still might find an opinionated collection of
writing advice useful. The primary audience we had in mind for this paper were
our own BSc, MSc, and PhD students, but also students of others. Our documented
advice therefore reflects a subjective and personal vision of writing ESE
papers. By no means do we claim to be fully objective, generalizable, or
representative of the whole discipline. With that being said, writing papers in
this way has worked pretty well for us so far. We hope that this guide can at
least partially do the same for others.

TL;DR: 本文介绍EmbedAgent范式和Embedbench基准测试来评估大语言模型在嵌入式系统开发能力，实验发现问题并提出策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缺少评估大语言模型在嵌入式系统开发能力的基准测试，需全面评估其能力。

Method: 引入EmbedAgent范式模拟角色，提出Embedbench基准测试，对10个主流大语言模型做实验。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务表现不同，如DeepSeek - R1部分任务通过率低，通用聊天和推理大语言模型有问题。提出策略后模型性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的检索增强生成和编译器反馈策略可有效提升大语言模型在嵌入式系统开发任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出自动化方法进行开源软件基本原理分析，利用预训练和大语言模型，通过Linux内核项目验证可行性，能支持分析并发现潜在冲突，可用于开发者处理隐藏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件贡献者需了解项目历史避免冲突，但此前缺乏自动化机制分析冲突。

Method: 基于Kantara架构，利用预训练模型和大语言模型，采用基于结构的机制检测冲突和问题。

Result: 通过Linux内核项目及其他五个项目验证方法可行，能支持原理分析，发现关系、检测冲突和问题，自动提取决策和原理句子有效。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法可帮助开发者主动处理隐藏问题，确保新更改不与过去决策冲突。

Abstract: Contributors to open source software must deeply understand a project's
history to make coherent decisions which do not conflict with past reasoning.
However, inspecting all related changes to a proposed contribution requires
intensive manual effort, and previous research has not yet produced an
automated mechanism to expose and analyze these conflicts. In this article, we
propose such an automated approach for rationale analyses, based on an
instantiation of Kantara, an existing high-level rationale extraction and
management architecture. Our implementation leverages pre-trained models and
Large Language Models, and includes structure-based mechanisms to detect
reasoning conflicts and problems which could cause design erosion in a project
over time. We show the feasibility of our extraction and analysis approach
using the OOM-Killer module of the Linux Kernel project, and investigate the
approach's generalization to five other highly active open source projects. The
results confirm that our automated approach can support rationale analyses with
reasonable performance, by finding interesting relationships and to detect
potential conflicts and reasoning problems. We also show the effectiveness of
the automated extraction of decision and rationale sentences and the prospects
for generalizing this to other open source projects. This automated approach
could therefore be used by open source software developers to proactively
address hidden issues and to ensure that new changes do not conflict with past
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用大语言模型进行测试代码生成时，直连提示导致模型假设代码库中不存在的函数和签名的问题。

Method: 结合检索增强生成（RAG）和提示工程，利用静态程序分析扩展提示，加入额外上下文信息；基于自定义提示模板微调基础大语言模型。

Result: 微调后的模型提高了生成代码与原开发者编写的测试代码的一致性，8x7b MoE模型微调后平均比基础模型提高8%，与更大的8x22b MoE模型得分相当。

Conclusion: 通过RAG、提示工程和模型微调等方法，能有效提高大语言模型生成测试代码与原代码的一致性。

Abstract: We describe test code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) in
Ericsson. Our input is a test step in natural language (English) and our output
is code (Java) which accomplishes the test step. We describe how straight
forward prompting does not suffice and results in LLM assuming functions and
signatures which are not present in the code repository. We then show how we
alleviate the problem by a combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
along with prompt engineering that expanded the simple prompt with additional
contextual information using static program analysis. We then describe further
improvements that we obtained by fine-tuning the underlying LLM. The fine
tuning is done based on a custom designed prompt template which has
pre-dependent classes, their public methods as well two exemplar outputs
obtained from RAG. Our results establish that our fine tuned models help
improve the correspondence or conformity with the original developer written
test code as measured by the traditional metrics of F1-score based on the
methods used in the generated code. Fine tuning of a 8x7b Mixture of Experts
(MoE) model leads to an average improvement of 8\% over the base model and is
comparable to the scores on a much larger 8x22b MoE model.

Result: 给出了文档对大语言模型理解遗留代码影响的初步发现

Conclusion: 提出了未来工作的战略目标

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

Result: 成功将原始汇编语言代码的关键组件压缩成3KB可共享、可保存和可扫描的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统存档技术提供了补充，有助于推动计算遗产保护领域的发展。

Abstract: This brief note presents a novel method for encoding historic Apollo 11 Lunar
Module guidance computer code into a single, compact Quick Response Code (QR
code) format, creating an accessible digital artifact for transmission and
archival purposes. By applying tokenization, selective content preservation,
and minimal HTML/JavaScript techniques, we successfully compressed key
components of the original Assembly Language Code (AGC) into a shareable,
preservable, and scannable 3 kilobyte (KB) image. We evaluate multiple
compression strategies and their tradeoffs in terms of size, readability, and
historical significance. This method addresses the challenge of making
historically significant software artifacts available through modern mobile
devices without requiring specialized hardware or internet connectivity. While
numerous digital preservation methods exist for historic software, this
approach balances accessibility with historical significance, offering a
complementary method to traditional archival techniques. This work contributes
to the broader field of computing heritage preservation by demonstrating how
landmark software can be made accessible instantly through contemporary mobile
technologies.

Conclusion: MultiMind能让开发者以低成本实现和试验新的AI交互，无缝集成到开发工作流。

Abstract: The integration of AI assistants into software development workflows is
rapidly evolving, shifting from automation-assisted tasks to collaborative
interactions between developers and AI. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their effectiveness in several development activities, including
code completion, test case generation, and documentation production. However,
embedding AI-assisted tasks within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
presents significant challenges. It requires designing mechanisms to invoke AI
assistants at the appropriate time, coordinate interactions with multiple
assistants, process the generated outputs, and present feedback in a way that
seamlessly integrates with the development workflow. To address these issues,
we introduce MultiMind, a Visual Studio Code plug-in that streamlines the
creation of AI-assisted development tasks. MultiMind provides a modular and
extensible framework, enabling developers to cost-effectively implement and
experiment with new AI-powered interactions without the need for complex IDE
customizations. MultiMind has been tested in two use cases: one for the
automatic generation of code comments and the other about the definition of
AI-powered chat.

Motivation: 创建一种无需构建步骤、依赖等，能以最小开发开销创建模块化、可复用UI元素的方法。

Method: 提出ZjsComponent组件，实现从HTML纯使用的组件和对象实例创建方式。

Result: ZjsComponent可动态加载和隔离HTML+JS片段，具有无依赖、DOM和代码隔离等特性。

Conclusion: ZjsComponent为开发者提供了简单构建可复用界面的方式。

Abstract: In this paper, I present ZjsComponent, a lightweight and framework-agnostic
web component designed for creating modular, reusable UI elements with minimal
developer overhead. ZjsComponent is an example implementation of an approach to
creating components and object instances that can be used purely from HTML.
Unlike traditional approaches to components, the approach implemented by
ZjsComponent does not require build-steps, transpiling, pre-compilation, any
specific ecosystem or any other dependency. All that is required is that the
browser can load and execute Javascript as needed by Web Components.
ZjsComponent allows dynamic loading and isolation of HTML+JS fragments,
offering developers a simple way to build reusable interfaces with ease. This
approach is dependency-free, provides significant DOM and code isolation, and
supports simple lifecycle hooks as well as traditional methods expected of an
instance of a class.

Method: 应用作者开发的基于无缝系统架构思想的信息系统自适应聚类方法（ACM）。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: The traceability of requirements in the information system design process is
considered an essential property of the project, one of its quality
characteristics. The point here is that traceability provides the methods of
validation and verification of software systems, and that the system model
based on requirements traceability reduces the system's dependence on
developers and, in general, makes it as straightforward as possible. One of the
challenges of the traceability process, dubbed "The grand challenge of
traceability" among traceability researchers, is its integration into the
design process. In this paper, to achieve this goal, we propose the application
of the Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM) of Information Systems developed by the
author, which is based on the idea of a seamless system architecture that
provides explicit interconnection of project artifacts of different levels of
abstraction.

iteration, CI based optimization, and autonomous agents that adapt behavior
using telemetry. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we describe an
architecture that supports integration with frameworks like DSPy, PromptWizard,
and Prompts as Programs. We demonstrate this through Opik, an open source MCP
server for LLM telemetry, and position our approach within the emerging LLMOps
ecosystem. This work lays a foundation for future research on prompt
optimization, IDE agent tooling, and empirical benchmarking in telemetry rich
AI development workflows.

Method: 以LangChain框架为基础，开发用户故事图变换器模块，用大语言模型从用户故事提取节点和关系构建知识图谱，通过脚本实现提取和评估自动化。

Result: 实现了知识图谱提取和评估的自动化。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于更有效的、以用户为中心的软件开发过程。

Abstract: This thesis introduces a novel methodology for the automated generation of
knowledge graphs from user stories by leveraging the advanced capabilities of
Large Language Models. Utilizing the LangChain framework as a basis, the User
Story Graph Transformer module was developed to extract nodes and relationships
from user stories using an LLM to construct accurate knowledge graphs.This
innovative technique was implemented in a script to fully automate the
knowledge graph extraction process. Additionally, the evaluation was automated
through a dedicated evaluation script, utilizing an annotated dataset for
assessment. By enhancing the visualization and understanding of user
requirements and domain concepts, this method fosters better alignment between
software functionalities and user expectations, ultimately contributing to more
effective and user-centric software development processes.

TL;DR: 提出功能聚类方法，可消除代码生成大模型幻觉错误并提供置信度评分，在LiveCodeBench上效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代码生成大语言模型存在幻觉导致的细微错误，无法安全自动部署。

Method: 提出功能聚类黑盒包装器，采样多个候选程序，在自生成测试套件上执行，对I/O行为相同的候选程序聚类，以最大簇的经验质量作为置信度估计。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，验证器保持基线通过率，将错误率从约65%降至2%，保守阈值下错误率为0%，仍能回答15.6%的提示。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需采样和沙盒执行，适用于闭源API和未来模型，为可靠的自动代码生成提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

TL;DR: 研究分析AI生成代码在迭代反馈中的安全退化问题，发现迭代后关键漏洞增加，挑战迭代能提升代码安全的假设并提出应对建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型用于代码生成时，对迭代反馈中安全漏洞演变关注不足，需研究其安全退化情况。

Method: 通过控制实验，对400个代码样本进行40轮‘改进’，采用四种不同提示策略。

Result: 仅五次迭代后关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示方法出现不同漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 迭代LLM改进不一定提升代码安全，强调人类专业知识在其中的关键作用，提出开发者减轻风险的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发环境复杂度增加，供应链安全受关注，但现有框架难以将抽象安全原则转化为具体实践。

Method: 与学术专家和行业从业者合作研究，利用KAOS目标建模方法建立战略目标和战术操作的可追溯联系，提供基于Web的导航工具。

Result: 框架将131个细化安全要求映射到400多个可操作步骤，通过Log4j漏洞案例展示实用性，提供OSCAL目录模型。

Conclusion: 该框架能增强清晰度、问责制和实际实施，便于组织自动化实施、简化合规流程并有效应对安全风险。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of modern software development environments has
heightened concerns around supply chain security. However, existing frameworks
often fall short in translating abstract security principles into concrete,
actionable practices. This paper introduces the Software Security Mapping
Framework, a structured solution designed to operationalize security
requirements across hierarchical levels -- from high-level regulatory standards
(e.g., ISM, Australia cybersecurity standard published by the Australian
Signals Directorate), through mid-level frameworks (e.g., NIST SSDF, the U.S.
Secure Software Development Framework), to fine-grained technical activities
(e.g., SLSA, a software supply chain security framework). Developed through
collaborative research with academic experts and industry practitioners, the
framework systematically maps 131 refined security requirements to over 400
actionable operational steps spanning the software development lifecycle. It is
grounded in four core security goals: Secure Software Environment, Secure
Software Development, Software Traceability, and Vulnerability Management. Our
approach leverages the KAOS goal modeling methodology to establish traceable
linkages between strategic goals and tactical operations, enhancing clarity,
accountability, and practical implementation. To facilitate adoption, we
provide a web-based navigation tool for interactive exploration of the
framework. A real-world case study based on the Log4j vulnerability illustrates
the framework's utility by generating a tailored checklist aligned with
industry best practices. Additionally, we offer a structured, machine-readable
OSCAL Catalog Model of the Software Security Mapping Framework, enabling
organizations to automate implementation, streamline compliance processes, and
respond effectively to evolving security risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可维护和通用的软件需将专门解决方案重构为可重用组件，随着代码代理解决孤立编程问题能力增强，需研究其代码重构能力。

Method: 提出Librarian（一种生成可重用库的抽样和重排方法）和Minicode（一个让代码代理将多个独立解决方案最小化并重构为联合库的基准）。

Result: 与现有技术的代码代理相比，Librarian在Minicode上的压缩和正确性方面取得了更好的结果，压缩率比编码代理高1.6 - 2倍，同时提高了正确性。

Conclusion: 代码代理在支持代码增长和可重用性的代码重构方面有一定效果，开源的代码和基准可用于进一步研究。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

TL;DR: 文章提出CodeMirage基准以解决现有基准不足，评估多种检测器并得出关键发现，助力AI生成代码检测器发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成代码存在风险，需检测，现有基准有局限，需全面基准支持检测器开发。

Method: 提出CodeMirage基准，涵盖十种编程语言、原始和改写代码样本及十种先进大模型输出；用其在四种配置下评估十种检测器，用三种指标报告结果。

Result: 分析得出九个关键发现，揭示当前检测器优缺点，指出未来工作挑战。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发鲁棒通用的AI生成代码检测器提供严格实用测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的编码代理在系统代码方面的有效性尚待探索，修改系统代码库任务艰巨，需研究大量上下文。

Method: 设计了代码研究代理Code Researcher，对代码语义、模式和提交历史进行多步推理，将上下文存储在结构化内存中以合成补丁。

Result: 在kBenchSyz基准测试中，Code Researcher崩溃解决率达58%，显著优于SWE - agent的37.5%，平均每次探索10个文件；在开源多媒体软件实验中展示了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集和多方面推理对大型代码库至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码检索基准主要关注功能相关性，忽略软件质量的关键维度。

Method: 引入CoQuIR基准，含42,725个查询和134,907个代码片段的质量注释及两个评估指标，用其对23个检索模型进行基准测试，探索训练方法并在合成数据集上测试。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型也常无法区分有缺陷或不安全的代码，探索的训练方法在不牺牲语义相关性的情况下提高了质量感知指标，下游代码生成实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 强调将质量信号集成到代码检索系统的重要性，为开发更可靠强大的软件开发工具奠定基础。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

TL;DR: 提出DCE - LLM框架用于自动消除死代码，表现优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 死代码在软件开发和LLM代码任务中带来诸多问题，现有工具存在不足，需要通用方法。

Method: 使用小型CodeBERT模型和基于归因的行选择器定位可疑代码，LLM生成判断和解释，在大规模注释数据集上微调。

Result: DCE - LLM在未使用和不可达代码上F1分数超94%，比GPT - 4o高30%。

Conclusion: DCE - LLM优于现有工具，具备先进检测、自动修正和多语言支持能力。

Abstract: Dead code introduces several challenges in software development, such as
increased binary size and maintenance difficulties. It can also obscure logical
errors and be exploited for obfuscation in malware. For LLM-based code-related
tasks, dead code introduces vulnerabilities that can mislead these models,
raising security concerns. Although modern compilers and IDEs offer dead code
elimination, sophisticated patterns can bypass these tools. A universal
approach that includes classification, location, explanation, and correction is
needed, yet current tools often require significant manual effort. We present
DCE-LLM, a framework for automated dead code elimination using a small CodeBERT
model with an attribution-based line selector to efficiently locate suspect
code. LLMs then generate judgments and explanations, fine-tuned on a
large-scale, annotated dead code dataset to provide detailed explanations and
patches. DCE-LLM outperforms existing tools, with advanced unreachability
detection, automated correction, and support for multiple programming
languages. Experimental results show DCE-LLM achieves over 94% F1 scores for
unused and unreachable code, significantly surpassing GPT-4o by 30%.

Abstract: In the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots, based on large
language models that can generate programming code in any language, write texts
and summarize information, it is obvious that the requirements of employers for
graduating students have already changed. The modern IT world offers
significant automation of programming through software frameworks and a huge
set of third-party libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs). All
these tools provide most of the necessary functionality out of the box (already
implemented), and quite naturally the question arises as to what is more useful
for students - to teach how to use these ready-made tools or the basic
principles of working and development of web applications from scratch. This
paper analyzes the results of a survey conducted among IT employers, aimed to
identify what, in their opinion, are the necessary technical skills that
graduating students in the field of Web Programming should possess in order to
join the company's work as quickly and effectively as possible.

TL;DR: 提出Coda框架解决PKT模型受编程活动中噪声信号影响的问题，实验表明其在有噪声记录下表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究忽视编程活动中的两类噪声信号，限制了模型性能和应用。

Method: 先将代码序列转为代码图识别无用信号，用聚类感知GCN处理代码图识别弱信号，再通过含约束和正则项的优化将轻量级适配器融入PKT任务。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明Coda能在有噪声编程记录下有效完成PKT任务。

Conclusion: Coda框架可有效应对噪声信号，提升PKT模型性能，且具有模型无关性。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Conclusion: 通过特定方法将大语言模型集成到建模与仿真中，能在不产生性能瓶颈的情况下发挥其优势，实现高质量建模与仿真。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for Modeling &
Simulation (M&S) through natural language interfaces that simplify workflows.
However, over-reliance risks compromising quality due to ambiguities, logical
shortcuts, and hallucinations. This paper advocates integrating LLMs as
middleware or translators between specialized tools to mitigate complexity in
M&S tasks. Acting as translators, LLMs can enhance interoperability across
multi-formalism, multi-semantics, and multi-paradigm systems. We address two
key challenges: identifying appropriate languages and tools for modeling and
simulation tasks, and developing efficient software architectures that
integrate LLMs without performance bottlenecks. To this end, the paper explores
LLM-mediated workflows, emphasizes structured tool integration, and recommends
Low-Rank Adaptation-based architectures for efficient task-specific
adaptations. This approach ensures LLMs complement rather than replace
specialized tools, fostering high-quality, reliable M&S processes.

Result: 应用于Qwen2.5 - Coder时，Pass@1最高提升28.91%，测试器性能提升68.90%，BLEU和CodeBLEU分数优于CodeRosetta，性能与DeepSeek - R1和GPT - 4.1相当。

Conclusion: MSL框架有效解决顺序到并行代码翻译的功能等价问题，显著提升基础模型性能。

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL
significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to
Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester
performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while
achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1. Our code is

Conclusion: 这项工作为进一步探索大语言模型驱动的生产系统中的外部工具集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

### [202] [Invocable APIs derived from NL2SQL datasets for LLM Tool-Calling Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11266)
*Benjamin Elder,Anupama Murthi,Jungkoo Kang,Ankita Rajaram Naik,Kiran Kate,Kinjal Basu,Danish Contractor*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文探索利用NL2SQL数据集自动创建NL2API数据集，创建API集合研究10个公共大语言模型性能，发现模型任务完成率低，有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署中系统需与大型复杂API集合交互，为创建此类数据集，探索利用现有NL2SQL数据集创建NL2API数据集。

Method: 提出新的数据生成管道，利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列，应用于BIRD - SQL数据集创建API集合，将自然语言查询与API序列配对。

Result: 研究发现所有模型难以确定正确工具集，任务完成率低（7 - 47%），作为ReACT代理时提升到50%，当前模型有时利用SQL比API更好。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的工具调用大语言模型有很大改进空间，还进行了详细消融研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

Abstract: Autonomous drones are rapidly reshaping industries ranging from aerial
delivery and infrastructure inspection to environmental monitoring and disaster
response. Ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these systems is
paramount as they transition from research prototypes to mission-critical
platforms. This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust

Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical
examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate
how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration
issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends
shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic
and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled
simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and
researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks,
and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型强化学习方法缺乏现实环境验证信号和显式优化，导致自我验证不可靠。

Method: 提出ReVeal框架，交织代码生成与显式自我验证和工具评估，通过定制RL算法提升性能。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench的Pass@k上显著提升，推理时代码随轮数增加而进化，超越DeepSeek - R1 - Zero - Qwen - 32B。

Conclusion: ReVeal是构建更强大、自主AI智能体的可扩展且有效的范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome
rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解区块链软件维护，为开发专业工具和实践提供依据，以提高健壮性和可维护性。

Abstract: Blockchain-based software systems are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, yet a systematic understanding of their development challenges remains
limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues
mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing
BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct
issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our
analysis reveals that both general software development issues and
blockchain-specific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet
Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further
examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times,
finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the
longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved
significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of
Ethereum and decentralized applications, but declined after 2022. These
findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance,
informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve
robustness and maintainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代漏洞检测工具导致开发成本浪费，现有漏洞评估方法依赖手动描述，质量和解释存在问题，性能受限。

Method: 提出VulStamp框架，采用静态分析和大语言模型提取漏洞代码意图信息，用提示调优模型评估漏洞，集成基于强化学习的提示调优方法训练评估模型。

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Although modern vulnerability detection tools enable developers to
efficiently identify numerous security flaws, indiscriminate remediation
efforts often lead to superfluous development expenses. This is particularly
true given that a substantial portion of detected vulnerabilities either
possess low exploitability or would incur negligible impact in practical
operational environments. Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has
emerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency.
Existing vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted
descriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability
in description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the
performance of these methods is seriously limited. To address this issue, this
paper introduces VulStamp, a novel intention-guided framework, to facilitate
description-free vulnerability assessment. Specifically, VulStamp adopts static
analysis together with Large Language Model (LLM) to extract the intention
information of vulnerable code. Based on the intention information, VulStamp
uses a prompt-tuned model for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, to
mitigate the problem of imbalanced data associated with vulnerability types,
VulStamp integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based prompt-tuning method to
train the assessment model.

Motivation: 现有一致性检查技术无法判断流程执行偏差的可取性，而人工评估存在耗时、主观和不可复制的问题。

Method: 基于对现有偏差可取性文献的回顾和概念化，结合对流程分析从业者和研究人员的访谈获得的经验见解，提出框架。

Result: 通过与从业者进行的可取性评估任务表明，框架能使他们简化评估过程，进行全面且简洁的评估。

Conclusion: 所提出的程序框架能有效帮助流程分析师系统地评估偏差的可取性。

Abstract: Conformance checking techniques help process analysts to identify where and
how process executions deviate from a process model. However, they cannot
determine the desirability of these deviations, i.e., whether they are
problematic, acceptable or even beneficial for the process. Such desirability
assessments are crucial to derive actions, but process analysts typically
conduct them in a manual, ad-hoc way, which can be time-consuming, subjective,
and irreplicable. To address this problem, this paper presents a procedural
framework to guide process analysts in systematically assessing deviation
desirability. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying which input
factors to consider in what order to categorize deviations into mutually
exclusive desirability categories, each linked to action recommendations. The
framework is based on a review and conceptualization of existing literature on
deviation desirability, which is complemented by empirical insights from
interviews with process analysis practitioners and researchers. We evaluate the
framework through a desirability assessment task conducted with practitioners,
indicating that the framework effectively enables them to streamline the
assessment for a thorough yet concise evaluation.

understanding of how LLMs with different characteristics perform on various

and (3) effectively detecting hallucinations on SE statements. The expected
contributions include a variety of LLMs trained and evaluated on
domain-specific datasets, new benchmarks on foundational knowledge in SE, and
methods for detecting hallucinations. Initial results in terms of performance
improvements on various non-code tasks are promising.

TL;DR: 本文从漏洞角度探索GPT - 4自动生成单元测试的能力，结果显示其有一定生成语法正确测试用例的能力，可用于漏洞见证测试生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发测试过程复杂且耗资源，为帮助开发者和安全专家，探索GPT - 4在漏洞方面自动生成单元测试的能力。

Method: 选取VUL4J数据集中含真实漏洞及修复的子集，基于修复前后代码，考察代码上下文影响、GPT - 4自我修正能力和生成测试用例的主观可用性。

Result: GPT - 4 66.5%的时间可生成语法正确测试用例，仅7.5%的情况能自动验证修复语义正确性，主观评估表明其生成的测试模板稍加人工开发可成完整的漏洞见证测试。

Conclusion: 尽管数据有限，GPT - 4可有效用于漏洞见证测试生成，在部分自动化过程中起重要作用。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

Motivation: 探索GPT - 4o在修复Java漏洞中的性能，研究不同上下文信息对自动漏洞修复能力的影响。

Method: 对比GPT - 4o和GPT - 4在相同提示下的性能，评估含不同上下文信息的9个额外提示，每个提示在42个漏洞上执行3次，用Vul4J测试框架验证修复候选。

Result: GPT - 4o平均比GPT - 4差11.9%，但能多修复10.5%不同漏洞；CVE信息显著提升修复率，任务描述长度影响小；结合CVE和手动提取代码上下文性能最佳；使用Top - 3提示，GPT - 4o至少一次修复62%漏洞。

Conclusion: 集成提示策略可在零样本设置下提高漏洞修复能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: 了解正念减压项目关键利益相关者的亲身经历，能为软件开发环境下应用该项目提供更详细信息。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from a qualitative study
(i.e., semi-structured interviews) on how a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
(MBSR) program, carried out in the Software Development (SD) working context,
is perceived by the software developers of a multinational company who
participated in the MBSR program and by the instructor who led it. MBSR is a
deeply personal and experiential practice in helping individuals manage stress,
particularly in high-pressure environments such as workplaces, healthcare
settings, education, and other demanding professional or personal situations.
Although MBSR has been experimented in different working contexts;
surprisingly, it has never been studied in the SD working context where there
are several stress factors that developers experience (e.g., time pressure and
uncertainty about the content of a particular task and its outcome). In this
respect, qualitative research can generate valuable insights into the
application of MBSR in the SD working context that cannot be captured by
standardized quantitative measures. Being MBSR instructors and software
developers the key stakeholders in delivering an MBSR program in the SD working
context, understanding their first-hand experiences can provide a more detailed
picture of the investigated phenomenon. The most important takeaway result of
our research can be summarized as follows: despite initial skepticism, the
developers recognized personal improvements due to the MBSR practice, though
the integration of MBSR techniques in the working context remained challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成和基于信息检索的代码审查评论生成方法各有不足，需一种新方法弥补二者差距。

Method: 提出利用检索增强生成（RAG），让预训练语言模型基于检索到的代码审查示例进行代码审查评论生成。

Result: 在Tufano等人的基准测试中，基于RAG的RCG表现优于基于生成和基于信息检索的RCG，在精确匹配、BLEU分数和低频真实标记生成上有提升，且检索示例数量增加性能提高。

Conclusion: 基于RAG的代码审查评论生成方法有效，能提升代码审查评论生成的性能。

Abstract: Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by
automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing
approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language
models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past
examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on
large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between
code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but
semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast,
IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing
examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example,
when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval
database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this
work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by
conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By
providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been
previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review
comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based
RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to
+1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to
generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency
ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance
improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.

Method: 对比62名计算机科学专业本科生和42名软件专业人员在同一Java程序上的错误修复任务，两组实验设置有差异。

Result: 考虑两组参与者差异，学生在修复错误方面表现优于专业人员，与以往部分实证证据不同。

Conclusion: 结果并非给出定论，而是促进关于实验中使用学生的讨论，鼓励研究影响软件工程任务的复杂因素，使实验更具现实性。

Abstract: Most Software Engineering (SE) human-based controlled experiments rely on
students as participants, raising concerns about their external validity.
Specifically, the realism of results obtained from students and their
applicability to the software industry remains in question. In this short
paper, we bring further evidence on this controversial point. To do so, we
compare 62 students and 42 software professionals on a bug-fixing task on the
same Java program. The students were enrolled in a Bachelor's program in
Computer Science, while the professionals were employed by two multinational
companies (for one of them, the professionals were from two offices). Some
variations in the experimental settings of the two groups (students and
professionals) were present. For instance, the experimental environment of the
experiment with professionals was more realistic; i.e., they faced some stress
factors such as interruptions during the bug-fixing task. Considering the
differences between the two groups of participants, the gathered data show that
the students outperformed the professionals in fixing bugs. This diverges to
some extent from past empirical evidence. Rather than presenting definitive
conclusions, our results aim to catalyze the discussion on the use of students
in experiments and pave the way for future investigations. Specifically, our
results encourage us to examine the complex factors influencing SE tasks,
making experiments as more realistic as possible.

Motivation: 帮助库开发者理解其API在实际中的使用情况，以便基于数据对错误报告、功能请求和测试活动进行优先级排序。

Method: 对21个流行开源C库及3061个C/C++客户端进行实证研究，开发LibProbe框架分析客户端并生成有用指标。

Result: 库开发者未根据客户端使用情况分配测试精力，流行API测试不足；可利用客户端测试套件改进库测试，如使LMDB覆盖率提高14.7%。

Conclusion: 通过研究为库开发者提供了关于API使用和测试的可行见解，LibProbe框架有助于库开发者分析客户端。

Abstract: For library developers, understanding how their Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) are used in the field can be invaluable. Knowing how clients
are using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug
reports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of
a bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API
is used.
  In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage
across 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a
combined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how
well library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for
library developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API
usage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that
library developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use
their API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a
popular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by
the library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be
leveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%
with the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the
APIs are used in the field.
  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be
used to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce
various metrics useful to library developers.

failure, any supersets of that program will also induce the same failure,
permitting the exclusion of subsets of non-failure-inducing programs. However,
this assumption does not always hold in practice. This paper introduces
Probabilistic Monotonicity Assessment (PMA), enhancing the efficiency of
DDMIN-style algorithms without sacrificing effectiveness. PMA dynamically
models and assesses the search space's monotonicity based on prior tests tried
during the debugging process and uses a confidence function to quantify
monotonicity, thereby enabling the probabilistic exclusion of subsets of
non-failure-inducing programs. Our approach significantly reduces redundant
tests that would otherwise be performed, without compromising the quality of
the reduction.
  We evaluated PMA against two leading DDMIN-style tools, CHISEL and ProbDD.
Our findings indicate that PMA cuts processing time by 59.2% compared to
CHISEL, accelerates the reduction process (i.e., the number of tokens deleted
per second) by 3.32x, and decreases the sizes of the final reduced programs by
6.7%. Against ProbDD, PMA reduces processing time by 22.0%, achieves a 1.34x
speedup in the reduction process, and further decreases the sizes of the final
reduced programs by 3.0%. These findings affirm PMA's role in significantly
improving delta debugging's efficiency while maintaining or enhancing its
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能有效解决自动驾驶数据场景检索难题，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing
extensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification,
research, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over
varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific
driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals
representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as
unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals.
Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both
domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are
difficult to verify for accuracy.
  This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that
combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling
natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap
indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of
query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database
querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for
intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates
improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating
dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software has led to the steady growth of
vulnerabilities. Vulnerability repair investigates how to fix software
vulnerabilities. Manual vulnerability repair is labor-intensive and
time-consuming because it relies on human experts, highlighting the importance
of Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR). In this SoK, we present the
systematization of AVR methods through the three steps of AVR workflow:
vulnerability analysis, patch generation, and patch validation. We assess AVR
tools for C/C++ and Java programs as they have been widely studied by the
community. Since existing AVR tools for C/C++ programs are evaluated with
different datasets, which often consist of a few vulnerabilities, we construct
the first C/C++ vulnerability repair benchmark dataset, dubbed Vul4C, which
contains 144 vulnerabilities as well as their exploits and patches. We use
Vul4C to evaluate seven AVR tools for C/C++ programs and use the third-party
Vul4J dataset to evaluate two AVR tools for Java programs. We also discuss
future research directions.

TL;DR: 研究低数据场景下识别移动应用质量特征的三种方法，发现众包和大语言模型方法分类准确，基于语言模式的方法潜力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线用户反馈丰富但缺乏合适训练语料，限制监督机器学习应用，需在低数据场景下有效识别质量特征。

Method: 研究基于质量相关关键词的语言模式、众包微任务指令和大语言模型提示三种方法，确定可行性并比较准确性。

Result: 语言模式方法精度不一且召回率低；众包在两阶段平均准确率最佳，大语言模型表现接近；基于多数投票的预测也有较好准确率。

Conclusion: 低数据场景下，众包和大语言模型方法能准确分类，语言模式方法潜力有限，众包和大语言模型还可能用于构建训练语料。

Abstract: Software qualities such as usability or reliability are among the strongest
determinants of mobile app user satisfaction and constitute a significant
portion of online user feedback on software products, making it a valuable
source of quality-related feedback to guide the development process. The
abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of
quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the
lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised
machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches
that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on
quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and large
language model (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach
and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of
quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision
(0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall;
crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases
(0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition
(0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings
show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing
or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while
the LP-based approach has only limited potential. The promise of crowdsourcing
and LLMs in this context might even extend to building training corpora.

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We present a Markovian market model driven by a hidden Brownian efficient
price. In particular, we extend the queue-reactive model, making its dynamics
dependent on the efficient price. Our study focuses on two sub-models: a
signal-driven price model where the mid-price jump rates depend on the
efficient price and an observable signal, and the usual queue-reactive model
dependent on the efficient price via the intensities of the order arrivals.
This way, we are able to correlate the evolution of limit order books of
different stocks. We prove the stability of the observed mid-price around the
efficient price under natural assumptions. Precisely, we show that at the
macroscopic scale, prices behave as diffusions. We also develop a maximum
likelihood estimation procedure for the model, and test it numerically. Our
model is them used to backest trading strategies in a liquidation context.

Method: 提出一种能量泛函，其驻点对应注意力机制，通过非线性注意力机制增强模型性能。

Result: 定义了能量景观，其梯度对应注意力计算，可用于在基于Transformer的模型中引入非线性头。

Conclusion: 非线性注意力机制能提升Transformer模型理解复杂关系、学习表示的能力及整体效率和性能。

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

Method: 提出FExD替代模型，通过增强分支网络表达能力和扩展主干网络预测能力学习多自由度完整解算子，并应用于斜拉桥模型进行响应预测。

Result: FExD在响应预测中相比普通DeepONet和改进的时空扩展DeepONet，具有更高精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: FExD在结构动力学应用的算子学习方面取得显著进展。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

Result: 在累积不准确性的适当条件下，不精确贝叶斯优化算法仍能实现次线性累积遗憾。

Conclusion: 随机网格搜索可作为有效且计算高效的采集函数求解器。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

Conclusion: 加深对过指定情况下EM行为的理解，为高维聚类和密度估计提供初始化和模型设计见解。

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

Conclusion: 不同场景下PGMs和GNNs表现有差异，可根据数据特征选择合适模型。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: 所提出的‘自由解压缩’方法能够有效解决不可触矩阵的特征谱估计问题。

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心互联NPU硬件资源需求大，任务间硬件需求不平衡导致资源利用率低，且之前研究忽略有硬件拓扑的核心互联NPU。

Method: 引入三种新技术，包括NPU路由虚拟化、NPU内存虚拟化和尽力而为的拓扑映射。并在FPGA平台和模拟器上开发原型。

Result: 相比统一虚拟内存和MIG等虚拟化方法，vNPU在各种ML模型上性能提升达2倍，硬件成本仅2%。

Conclusion: vNPU是一种有效的核心互联NPU虚拟化设计，能在低硬件成本下提升性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, an
emerging class of AI accelerators, termed Inter-core Connected Neural
Processing Units (NPU), has been adopted in both cloud and edge computing
environments, like Graphcore IPU, Tenstorrent, etc. Despite their innovative
design, these NPUs often demand substantial hardware resources, leading to
suboptimal resource utilization due to the imbalance of hardware requirements
across various tasks. To address this issue, prior research has explored
virtualization techniques for monolithic NPUs, but has neglected inter-core
connected NPUs with the hardware topology.
  This paper introduces vNPU, the first comprehensive virtualization design for
inter-core connected NPUs, integrating three novel techniques: (1) NPU route
virtualization, which redirects instruction and data flow from virtual NPU
cores to physical ones, creating a virtual topology; (2) NPU memory
virtualization, designed to minimize translation stalls for SRAM-centric and
NoC-equipped NPU cores, thereby maximizing the memory bandwidth; and (3)
Best-effort topology mapping, which determines the optimal mapping from all
candidate virtual topologies, balancing resource utilization with end-to-end
performance. We have developed a prototype of vNPU on both an FPGA platform
(Chipyard+FireSim) and a simulator (DCRA). Evaluation results indicate that,
compared to other virtualization approaches such as unified virtual memory and
MIG, vNPU achieves up to a 2x performance improvement across various ML models,
with only 2% hardware cost.

TL;DR: 提出适用于Versal架构的DPUV4E，设计计算单元，实验表明相比之前设计有更好性能和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPGA难平衡性能与通用性，AMD Versal ACAP架构内存带宽不足，无法充分利用AIE理论性能。

Method: 提出DPUV4E，设计Conv PE和DWC PE计算单元，利用数据重用机会缓解带宽瓶颈，扩展PE功能用于非卷积操作。

Result: 实验显示相比之前设计，提供8.6倍TOPS/W，减少95.8% DSP使用、44.7% LUT使用，单批次下延迟降至68.5%，端到端推理中深度卷积模型吞吐量提升2.2倍，标准模型提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: DPUV4E设计有效提升性能，减少资源使用，提高推理吞吐量。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于知识图谱嵌入和贝叶斯推理的车道变更预测系统，在真实硬件上验证，能提前3 - 4秒预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数车道变更预测研究局限于仿真或数据集，与实际道路部署有差距，本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 系统包含感知模块和预训练预测模块，感知模块将环境信息转化为语言类别，预测模块用KGE和贝叶斯推理模型预测并转化为纵向制动动作。

Result: 真实硬件实验表明，系统能提前三到四秒预测目标车辆车道变更。

Conclusion: 该车道变更预测系统能为自车提供足够反应时间，让目标车辆安全变道。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

TL;DR: 开发了参数和内存高效的MindGrab模型用于容积颅骨剥离，在多模态数据集上评估，表现优异且资源需求低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发参数和内存高效的模型进行多模态头部图像的容积颅骨剥离。

Method: 基于扩张卷积的光谱解释设计架构，用模态无关的合成数据训练，在回顾性多模态数据集上评估，与SynthStrip、ROBEX和BET对比。

Result: MindGrab平均Dice分数95.9，显著优于经典方法，与SynthStrip相当或更优；参数少95%，推理快至少2倍，GPU内存使用降低50%。

Conclusion: MindGrab实现了最先进的准确率，同时显著降低资源需求，可在多个平台使用。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

TL;DR: 研究不同INRs在2D和3D信号上的性能，发现多数情况下正则化网格表现更好，少数场景INRs有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对隐式神经表示（INRs）的基本能力、隐式偏差和缩放行为理解不足。

Method: 在不同有效带宽的2D和3D真实及合成信号上，对多种INRs在过拟合和泛化任务中进行性能研究，并按模型大小、信号类型和带宽分层分析。

Result: 多数任务和信号中，正则化网格训练更快、质量更高；少数场景如拟合低维结构信号时，INRs优于网格。

Conclusion: 可指导INRs未来应用于更具优势的场景。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at
https://github.com/voilalab/INR-benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出基于transformers的神经网络架构用于cryo - EM图像去噪，在合成数据上有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高噪声环境如cryo - EM投影图像去噪中作用有限，而数据集中同一分子不同视角投影的信息冗余可用于传统去噪技术，因此希望改进去噪方法。

Method: 提出基于transformers的神经网络架构，同时对cryo - EM图像进行聚类、对齐和去噪。

Result: 在合成数据上有准确的去噪性能，在信噪比为0.03时，相对均方误差比单图像DNNs降低45%。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于transformers的神经网络架构能有效改进cryo - EM图像去噪效果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

TL;DR: 本文比较基于扩散和非扩散的深度学习模型在癫痫成像的MRI到PET图像转换任务中的表现，发现SGM-KD在纯MRI转换PET时效果最佳，含1%低剂量PET输入时各模型表现相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癫痫患者FDG - PET检查因辐射剂量问题不理想，且用先进生成AI方法从MRI或超低剂量PET合成诊断质量PET图像的工作较少，需针对癫痫人群进行临床评估。

Method: 使用同步PET/MRI对52名受试者进行研究，测试三种模型（2种基于分数的生成扩散模型SGM - KD、SGM - VP和Transformer - Unet），评估标准图像处理指标和临床相关指标。

Result: SGM - KD在纯T1w和T2 FLAIR图像合成PET时定性和定量结果最佳；当输入含1%低剂量PET图像时，所有模型显著改善，定量性能和视觉质量可互换。

Conclusion: SGMs在纯MRI到PET转换有很大潜力，三种模型都能用MRI和超低剂量PET准确合成全剂量FDG - PET。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Result: 与传统CNN - LSTM基线相比，AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率为81.25%。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec有潜力集成到可穿戴压力监测平台和个性化医疗系统中。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Result: 在非高斯测量白噪声实验中，模型优于传统卡尔曼滤波器和现有深度学习估计器。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet能实现准确状态估计和一致的误差协方差量化。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: Engineered timber is pivotal to low-carbon construction, but moisture uptake
during its service life can compromise structural reliability and impede reuse
within a circular economy model. Despite growing interest, quantitative
standards for classifying the reusability of moisture-exposed timber are still
lacking. This study develops a probabilistic framework to determine the
post-exposure reusability of engineered timber. Laminated specimens were soaked
to full saturation, dried to 25% moisture content, and subjected to destructive
three-point flexural testing. Structural integrity was quantified by a
residual-performance metric that assigns 80% weight to the retained flexural
modulus and 20% to the retained maximum load, benchmarked against unexposed
controls. A hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic model with horseshoe
priors, calibrated through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, jointly infers
the decision threshold separating three Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)
reuse levels and predicts those levels from five field-measurable features:
density, moisture content, specimen size, grain orientation, and surface
hardness. Results indicate that a single wet-dry cycle preserves 70% of
specimens above the 0.90 residual-performance threshold (Level 1), whereas
repeated cycling lowers the mean residual to 0.78 and reallocates many
specimens to Levels 2-3. The proposed framework yields quantified decision
boundaries and a streamlined on-site testing protocol, providing a foundation
for robust quality assurance standards.

Abstract: In sports analytics, home field advantage is a robust phenomenon where the
home team wins more games than the away team. However, discovering the causal
factors behind home field advantage presents unique challenges due to the
non-stationary, time-varying environment of sports matches. In response, we
propose a novel causal discovery method, DYnamic Non-stAtionary local
M-estimatOrs (DYNAMO), to learn the time-varying causal structures of home
field advantage. DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss
functions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal
structures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes. By
leveraging local information, we provide theoretical guarantees for the
identifiability and estimation consistency of non-stationary causal structures
without imposing additional assumptions. Simulation studies validate the
efficacy of DYNAMO in recovering time-varying causal structures. We apply our
method to high-resolution event data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 English
Premier League seasons, during which the former season had no audience
presence. Our results reveal intriguing, time-varying, team-specific field
advantages influenced by referee bias, which differ significantly with and
without crowd support. Furthermore, the time-varying causal structures learned
by our method improve goal prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual

hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

*Sadman Sadeed Omee,Lai Wei,Sourin Dey,Jianjun Hu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 提出多目标遗传算法ParetoCSP2用于无机多晶型晶体结构预测，性能优于基线算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效预测无机多晶型结构的算法有限，需要新算法辅助材料研究。

Method: 提出ParetoCSP2算法，结合自适应空间群多样性控制技术、神经网络原子间势，采用改进的种群初始化方法和迭代结构弛豫。

Result: ParetoCSP2在多晶型预测中表现出色，对特定公式的空间群和结构相似度准确率近乎完美，关键性能指标提升显著。

Conclusion: ParetoCSP2是有效的多晶型晶体结构预测算法，代码开源。

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 结合多源卫星观测与概率深度学习模型，分析1988 - 2021年全球森林地上碳（AGC）动态，发现全球森林总体为碳汇，但部分森林有碳源汇转变，热带森林AGC对陆地碳循环影响增大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林生态系统对陆地碳循环和缓解全球变暖很重要，但森林AGC长期动态及源汇转变高度不确定，需研究。

Method: 将多源卫星观测与概率深度学习模型集成，同时估算AGC及其不确定性。

Result: 30年间全球森林是AGC汇；部分森林有源汇转变；大气CO₂增长率与热带AGC通量变率关系为负；巴西亚马逊毁林和未受干扰地区AGC损失占比变化。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC对陆地碳循环变率的调节作用增大，人为气候变化对AGC变化影响可能增加。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Motivation: 传感器和自动化发展使实时提取信息重要，传统过滤方法难适应动态数据，需新方法。

Result: FPGA 验证原位训练，计算精度与传统软件方法相当，当前 FPGA 每芯片可训练约 3500 个神经元网络。

Conclusion: 架构可扩展适应，推动学习集成到探测器系统，实现新的极端边缘实时信息处理。

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

Conclusion: 给出大语言模型时代教育和劳动力培训的政策启示。

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

Motivation: 探讨医疗组织开发自有基础模型而非依赖商业替代品的战略必要性。

Method: 分析实证证据、经济框架和组织案例研究。

Result: 自有多模态基础模型能使医疗组织实现卓越临床绩效、维持强大数据治理、创造可持续竞争优势和加速创新路径，具备自有AI能力的组织有更好表现。

Conclusion: 为医疗领导者提供评估基础模型构建或购买决策的框架，认为自有基础模型开发是有前瞻性医疗组织的核心能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

Conclusion: 两组都认为本世纪有主观体验的AI系统可能出现，但时间和应对有不确定性和分歧。

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

Motivation: 预测gRNA活性对CRISPR - Cas12基因组编辑至关重要，但因数据有限、PAM变异和依赖大规模训练而具挑战，探究未进行特定领域预训练的基础模型能否改善gRNA活性估计。

Method: 使用现有RNA基础模型的嵌入作为轻量级回归器输入，并整合染色质可及性数据。

Result: 相比传统基线有显著提升，整合染色质可及性数据进一步提高性能。

Conclusion: 预训练基础模型和染色质可及性数据对gRNA活性预测有效。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity
prediction.

Conclusion: 分层建模和基于GRN的表示很重要。

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

Conclusion: SemanticST为空间转录组学分析提供了可扩展、可解释且有生物学依据的框架。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

Method: 利用超高速成像捕捉LIC过程中气泡半径动态，用基于物理模拟数据训练的神经网络Bubble Dynamics Transformer（BDT）分析数据，推断材料粘弹性参数。

Result: BDT能准确推断材料粘弹性参数，无需迭代拟合或复杂反演过程。

Conclusion: 该方法可在极端加载条件下快速、准确、非接触地表征软材料，对生物医学和材料科学有重要意义。

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

Conclusion: HQFNN是传统视觉骨干网络的替代方案，为未来量子原生模糊学习框架提供模板。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

TL;DR: 本文提出对变分自编码器（VAEs）进行两项关键修改，使其能学习量子数据中有物理意义的潜在表征，在量子系统研究中展现潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAEs处理量子数据时忽视其概率特性，阻碍有意义物理描述符的提取，需改进VAEs以学习量子数据中有意义、可解释的表征。

Method: 对VAEs进行两项关键修改，即能忠实再现量子态的解码器和针对此任务的概率损失函数。

Result: 使用基准量子自旋模型，发现标准方法失效时改进方法仍能学习到有意义可解释的表征；应用于里德堡原子阵列实验数据，模型能自主揭示相结构。

Conclusion: 改进的VAEs可作为无监督且可解释的工具用于量子系统研究。

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于大语言模型的Gondola模型用于机器人操作泛化，构建三种数据集训练，在GemBench数据集四个泛化水平上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合大语言模型提升机器人操作泛化能力的方法在视觉环境中生成有效计划不足，且受单视图图像输入限制，物体定位不精确。

Method: 引入Gondola模型，利用多视图图像和历史计划生成含目标物体和位置分割掩码的行动规划，用RLBench模拟器构建三种数据集进行训练。

Result: Gondola在GemBench数据集的四种泛化水平（新放置、刚体、铰接物体和长周期任务）上优于现有基于大语言模型的方法。

Conclusion: Gondola模型可有效提升机器人操作在不同场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Method: 通过40名参与者的公共空间研究进行长视野机器人任务，在模拟中重现设置并注释所有演示。

Result: 识别出四种旁支类型和一种控制模式，旁支频繁出现且时空分布与任务上下文相关，用户控制模式依赖控制界面。

Conclusion: 需要更好的次优演示模型来改进LfD算法，缩小实验室训练和现实部署的差距。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic
communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems
and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents.
RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples
client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range
of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based
orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport
layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured
operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features
such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace
isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and
security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and
adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with
deployment practices and applicability across industries including
manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient,
and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

Method: 提出SAIL系统，集成一致性动作推理算法、高保真运动目标跟踪、自适应速度调制和动作调度四个紧密相连的组件。

Result: 在模拟和两个真实机器人平台的12个任务实验中，SAIL在模拟中比演示速度最多快4倍，在现实中最多快3.2倍。

Conclusion: SAIL系统能有效实现视觉运动策略的超演示速度执行，提高机器人系统的任务吞吐量。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

Result: BrainMAP在不牺牲预测准确性的前提下，计算效率优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: BrainMAP框架在神经退行性疾病相关脑区识别方面具有高效准确的优势。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的技术对可靠、高精度的场景挖掘有效。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning

the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效增强大语言模型在临床环境中的推理能力，提升医学图像诊断效果。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了半监督语义分割的现有问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: LLM - Phy3D在物理AI的科学和工程应用中有潜在的广泛用途。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Method: 识别VLMs中被忽视的视觉社交语用推理差距，提出视觉社交语用推理新任务，构建高质量数据集测试VLMs能力并进行基准测试。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Result: 模块可用于其他多模态模型并取得先进结果，用该方法训练的模型July仅3B参数就取得最优结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在处理空间关系方面有潜力，能提升模型表现。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效减轻多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Method: 使用近800张鸟瞰图训练微调的YOLOv11模型，评估无人机高度等因素影响，用加州北部无人机影像评估系统。

Result: 微调的YOLOv11模型平均绝对误差0.97 mph，均方误差0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 微调的YOLOv11模型能有效解决车辆速度检测和分类问题。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Result: 在多个视觉任务和代表性ViT架构上实验表明，该方法比现有方法显著提升精度，尤其在低比特量化场景。

Conclusion: 所提FIMA - Q方法能有效解决ViTs后训练量化精度下降问题。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Conclusion: 为数据高效的视频语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

TL;DR: 提出OV - MAP用于移动机器人的开放世界3D映射，实验表明其在零样本性能、鲁棒性和适应性上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前重叠特征影响实例级精度，需增强移动机器人开放世界3D映射中的对象识别能力。

Method: 采用类无关分割模型将2D掩码投影到3D空间，结合合并原始和合成深度的补充深度图像，使用3D掩码投票机制。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica等公共数据集的综合实验及真实世界实验中，展现出优越的零样本性能、鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: OV - MAP方法有效，可用于不同环境的开放世界3D映射。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

### [291] [Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515)
*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级插件Manager，用于Two - Tower VLM和MLLM架构，提升多下游任务性能，经理与多网格算法协同可改善视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BridgeTower存在单模态表示利用不充分、单模态语义知识利用不灵活和仅在低分辨率数据集评估的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出Manager插件，在Two - Tower VLM架构下引入ManagerTower，还拓展到MLLM架构，且分析经理与多网格算法协同作用。

Result: ManagerTower在4个下游VL任务上优于先前基线；LLaVA - OV - Manager提升LLaVA - OV在20个下游数据集的零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager和多网格算法可作为插件从不同角度改善视觉表示，协同可缓解语义歧义并提升性能。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

Motivation: 解决语义分割中手动像素级标注成本高、易出错的问题，以及现有主动标签校正方法仍存在的效率问题。

Method: 提出A²LC框架，将自动校正阶段集成到传统流程中，利用标注者反馈对查询样本之外的标签进行校正；引入自适应平衡采集函数，强调代表性不足的尾部类别。

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012上的大量实验表明，A²LC显著优于现有方法，仅用20%的预算就超过以往方法，在Cityscapes数据集同等预算下性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A²LC是一种高效、有效的主动标签校正框架，能显著提高语义分割标注效率和性能。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: EasyARC为评估视觉语言模型的真正推理和测试时扩展能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

Motivation: 现有公平性研究多关注分类特征，肤色数据性质不同，需新方法评估机器学习中处理肤色时的公平性。

Result: 新技术能捕捉传统不同组内和组间公平性的细微差别，创新训练方法可更细致公平地处理肤色。

Conclusion: 提出的新技术和训练方法可有效评估和处理机器学习中肤色相关的公平性问题。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型在预测任务中使用因果无关信号的问题，如预测图像时利用照明条件而非物体细节。

Method: 引入标准反因果预测模型（SAM）构建因果框架，提出使用条件距离相关的正则化策略DISCO。

Result: DISCO在不同的偏差缓解实验中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: DISCO是经典基于核方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Method: 采用三阶段方法，先使用nn - Unet分割网络划定气道结构边界，再从气管及气道周围提取关键特征，最后将分割区域的影像组学特征集成到SVM分类器。

Result: 任务1分割总体得分0.8601，任务2分类得分0.7346。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Result: 二进制ViT平均测试准确率达90%，显著高于卷积网络和基于CLIP的模型；单因素方差分析显示差异有统计学意义；定性分析揭示ViT定位特定姿势区域，简单前馈模型关注背景纹理。

Conclusion: 强调Transformer表示的数据效率和可解释性技术在诊断特定类别失败中的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA基准和MTabVQA - Instruct数据集有助于提升VLMs在多表格视觉推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical
motion.

Conclusion: DISCOVR是一种有效的心脏超声视频表征学习方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Result: 在基准数据集（MVTec - AD, VisA）上实验，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类上始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态多模型融合在解决异常检测多方面挑战有效，为实际应用提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Motivation: 有效多模态推理依赖视觉和语言表征对齐，但视觉语言模型实现对齐的机制尚不清楚。

Method: 保持大语言模型和视觉Transformer冻结，仅训练线性适配器；使用预训练稀疏自编码器作为分析探针；系统分析自编码器的重构误差、稀疏模式和特征描述。

Result: 揭示视觉表征逐渐与语言特征表征对齐的逐层进展过程，发现视觉Transformer输出与语言模型早期层存在基本不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构是否能最优地促进跨模态表征学习存在疑问。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Motivation: 解决两人非零和半定博弈中纳什均衡的计算问题。

Result: 证明了在合适非退化条件下曲线分支的光滑性，建立了与经典算法解释的联系。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法框架在两人非零和半定博弈中有良好应用前景及理论价值。

Abstract: We consider an algorithmic framework for two-player non-zero-sum semidefinite
games, where each player's strategy is a positive semidefinite matrix with
trace one. We formulate the computation of Nash equilibria in such games as
semidefinite complementarity problems and develop symbolic-numeric techniques
to trace generalized Lemke-Howson paths. These paths generalize the piecewise
affine-linear trajectories of the classical Lemke-Howson algorithm for bimatrix
games, replacing them with nonlinear curve branches governed by eigenvalue
complementarity conditions.
  A key feature of our framework is the introduction of event points, which
correspond to curve singularities. We analyze the local behavior near these
points using Puiseux series expansions. We prove the smoothness of the curve
branches under suitable non-degeneracy conditions and establish connections
between our approach and both the classical combinatorial and
homotopy-theoretic interpretations of the Lemke-Howson algorithm.

Motivation: 解决无约束优化问题，在较弱条件下找到近似随机驻点。

Method: 提出含Polyak动量、多外推动量和递归动量的归一化随机一阶方法，采用动态更新算法参数。

Result: 建立复杂度结果，复杂度界改进或匹配现有最佳结果，数值实验验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法在解决无约束优化问题上有效，在较弱条件下有良好表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

TL;DR: 提出PMF - CEC方法改进端到端ASR模型对罕见词的识别，引入保留概率机制提升错误检测准确率，实验表明该方法有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR后处理方法ED - CEC处理发音相似但拼写不同的罕见词时准确率低，且之前的错误检测模块存在过度检测问题。

Method: 在ED - CEC基础上提出PMF - CEC方法以区分目标罕见词和同音词，引入保留概率机制过滤低置信度编辑操作。

Result: 在五个数据集上实验，PMF - CEC保持合理推理速度，相比ED - CEC进一步降低有偏词错误率，纠正同音词优势更强，优于其他上下文偏置方法，与基于LLM的方法相比推理更快、鲁棒性更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了端到端ASR模型对罕见词的识别性能，具有一定优势。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

Method: 对联邦学习过程不同层面进行正则化，包括基于参数、基于嵌入和基于新型损失的正则化。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Conclusion: 所提方法在转录准确性和半监督ASR模型训练上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers

Conclusion: PSR为光学神经网络训练提供了有前景的替代方法，可规避有限差分近似和全光反向传播实现的局限性，有助于推进光学计算系统高效硬件训练策略的发展。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Result: 可利用Eckart - Young - Schmidt定理理解带正交约束的对称自编码器的重建误差。

Conclusion: 提出的EYS初始化策略有一定价值，凸显了模型设计和初始化的重要性。

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

Result: 展示了数据驱动范式在逆问题求解上结合了准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 探讨了该领域的开放问题和未来展望。

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估印尼央行QRIS支付系统政策采纳情况，解决疫情作为混淆因素干扰评估的问题。

Method: 提出统一技术接受和使用理论（UTAUT）的新变体模型，采用目的抽样法对疫情期间572名在线调查受访者的数据进行估计。

Result: 成功分离政策与疫情影响，区分疫情风险与常见风险及其他技术采纳决定因素，发现央行政策和疫情风险是影响使用QRIS意愿的最有影响力变量。

Conclusion: 该测量方法可作为评估央行政策影响人们行为有效性的补充工具。

Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the adoption of Bank Indonesia's QRIS (Quick
Response code Indonesian Standard) payment system policy. The evaluation is
hindered by the contemporaneous emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which acts
as a confounding factor in adopting the new payment instrument. To disentangle
the impact of central bank policy from the pandemic, a novel variation of the
model of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is proposed
and is estimated using purposive sampling from an online survey with 572
respondents during the pandemic. The result of the study successfully
disentangles the policy effect from the pandemic effect, and also separate the
risk of pandemic with common risks (PR) and other technology adoption
determinants. The results indicate that perceived central bank policy and
pandemic risk are the most influential variables affecting the intention to use
QRIS. The findings suggest that this measurement approach can be appropriately
used as a complementary tool to examine the effectiveness of the central bank's
policy in influencing people's behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究采用工具变量法和双重差分设计分析俄罗斯人口普查和纵向数据集，发现俄罗斯生育对女性就业的影响在产后第一年最大，后迅速下降，男性无系统性父职惩罚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进俄罗斯现有关于育儿惩罚的相关文献，提供生育决策对当代俄罗斯父母后续劳动力市场结果影响的因果估计。

Method: 采用基于兄弟姐妹性别构成和多胞胎的工具变量法，结合双重差分设计，分析丰富的人口普查和纵向数据集。

Result: 俄罗斯生育对女性就业的因果影响在产后第一年最显著，使就业减少约15%，孩子到学龄时降至3%；男性在就业方面无系统性父职惩罚，劳动供给有适度增加。

Conclusion: 与发达国家约10%的长期母职惩罚不同，俄罗斯生育对女性就业影响有其特点，男性无系统性父职惩罚。

Abstract: The present study aimed to improve upon the existing correlational literature
on the parenthood penalty in Russia. An instrumental variables approach based
on sibling sex composition and multiple births was employed alongside
difference-in-differences designs to analyze rich census and longitudinal
datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to
provide causal estimates of the effect of fertility decisions on subsequent
labor market outcomes for mothers and fathers in contemporary Russia. The
study's primary finding is that, in contrast to the approximately 10 percent
long-term motherhood penalty observed in developed countries, the causal impact
of childbearing on women's employment in Russia is most significant in the
first year after birth, reducing employment by around 15 percent. This penalty
then rapidly declines to a modest 3 percent once children reach school age. The
analysis indicates an absence of a systematic fatherhood penalty in terms of
employment, although a modest increase in labor supply is observed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型需保护隐私，差分隐私可降低隐私风险，因此开展相关综述。

Method: 探究差分隐私基础定义，回顾其发展，深入分析其融入机器学习模型方式，介绍实践中评估方法。

Result: 对差分隐私在机器学习中的各方面进行了系统梳理。

Conclusion: 全面综述差分隐私有助于安全和负责任的AI系统的持续发展。

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出KEENHash哈希方法用于程序级二进制代码相似度分析，比现有方法更快且有效，在大规模场景表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数级二进制代码相似度分析方法时间复杂度高，在大规模场景不可扩展，需有效高效的程序级分析方法。

Method: 提出KEENHash，通过大语言模型生成函数嵌入将二进制文件哈希为程序级表示，用K - Means和特征哈希将二进制文件浓缩为一个紧凑固定长度的程序嵌入。

Result: KEENHash比现有函数匹配工具至少快215倍，在53亿次相似度评估中仅需395.83秒，在程序克隆搜索中比4种现有方法至少高23.16%。

Conclusion: KEENHash在大规模二进制代码相似度分析的程序克隆搜索和恶意软件检测等安全场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many
fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are
the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for
evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a
high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g.,
1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we
propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into
program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated
function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and
fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us
to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the
previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash
is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools
while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with
5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while
these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the
program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305
binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of
them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the
large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.

Result: 完成了对视听攻击（包括对抗、后门、越狱攻击等）及最新视听多模态大模型攻击类型的综述。

Conclusion: 指出了视听攻击和防御未来研究的挑战和新兴趋势。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this
paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based
MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon
comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both
challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and
defense.

Motivation: 外包神经网络推理存在隐私挑战，现有安全推理框架计算和通信开销大，不适合实际部署。

Method: 集成新型布尔GMW协议用于安全比较，使用预处理Beaver位三元组；采用NTT预处理和GPU加速同态加密操作；提出位精确变体SecONNds - P。

Result: 非线性操作在线加速17倍，线性操作CPU加速1.6倍、GPU加速2.2倍；37位量化SqueezeNet模型，GPU端到端推理时间2.8秒、CPU为3.6秒，总通信量420 MiB。

Conclusion: SecONNds效率高、计算负载低，适合在资源受限环境部署隐私敏感应用，且开源。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and
can be accessed from: https://github.com/shashankballa/SecONNds.

TL;DR: 电商行业增长吸引诈骗分子，公司调查可疑交易致分析师警报疲劳。提出FAA框架，用多模态大语言模型自动调查信用卡欺诈并生成报告，评估显示其可靠高效，能减轻分析师工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商行业增长使诈骗分子利用被盗信用卡信息，公司调查可疑交易，分析师面对大量警报产生疲劳，需要解决方案。

Method: 提出FAA框架，利用大语言模型的推理、代码执行和视觉能力，在每个调查步骤中进行规划、证据收集和分析。

Result: 对500次信用卡欺诈调查的综合实证评估表明，FAA框架平均包含七个步骤，调查可靠且高效。

Conclusion: FAA框架可以自动处理大部分工作，有助于减少欺诈分析师面临的挑战。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

TL;DR: 本文指出漏洞数据集用于ML测试存在问题，提出数据集重构方法，用4个时间数据集和5个ML模型验证，发现多数模型未学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时要么过于乐观要么过于保守，且未考虑标签随时间变化，过去性能与未来性能可能不一致。

Method: 提出将数据集重构为一系列数据集的方法，用Mann - Kendall检验模型性能随时间的变化，用4个时间数据集和5个ML模型验证。

Result: 趋势结果显示性能多年来变化不一致，多数模型未学习。

Conclusion: 多数ML模型在漏洞检测中未学习，直观认为回顾性信息越多性能越好的观点不成立。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Conclusion: HbHAI能在加密形式下用现有AI算法分析处理数据，性能优于现有同态加密方案。

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

Result: 完成GeoPandas - AI智能类的设计，并在PyPI包管理器中提供开源实现。

Conclusion: GeoPandas - AI为代码协同编写者引入新范式，并应用于地理空间开发。

Abstract: Geospatial data analysis plays a crucial role in tackling intricate societal
challenges such as urban planning and climate modeling. However, employing
tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data
manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and
workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into
the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an
intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code
development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and
provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager.
Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful
exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI
introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial
development.

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

Conclusion: Swin Transformer模型能以高分辨率学习人类大脑的时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和未来脑机接口发展提供潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架具有广泛适用性，可轻松扩展用于分析其他类型的多元函数数据。

Abstract: In this article, we develop a novel covariate grouping framework in the
context of multiple functional regression, in which a scalar response is
associated with multiple functional covariates. We apply this approach to
examine the relationship between chronological age and gait angular kinematics
in a cohort of healthy individuals. This application is motivated by the need
to understand and communicate the risk of chronic joint disease associated with
aging by studying how age influences gait patterns. A key challenge stems from
the significant interdependence among various joints, which provides important
insights into how movement coordination evolves with aging. This limitation
drives the primary objective of this work: to develop an efficient methodology
to unravel both the association between chronological age and joint kinematics,
and the coordination across different joints. To achieve this goal, we develop
a forest-structured covariate grouping framework in which different functional
covariates are aggregated hierarchically based on the level of coefficient
homogeneity. This approach allows for the analysis of both common and
idiosyncratic effects of covariates in a nuanced, multi-resolution manner. The
identification of the forest structure is entirely data-driven and requires no
prior knowledge, providing valuable insights into the interdependence among
covariates. Compared to existing methods, the proposed regression framework
demonstrates superior predictive power and offers more insightful
interpretability. In addition, the proposed framework is broadly applicable and
can be readily extended to analyze other types of multivariate functional data.

Abstract: This research develops a Bayesian framework for analyzing failure times using
the Weibull distribution, addressing challenges in prior selection due to the
lack of conjugate priors and multi-dimensional sufficient statistics. We
propose an adaptive semi-parametric MCMC algorithm for lifetime data analysis,
employing a hierarchical Bayesian model and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in
STAN. Twenty-four combinations of prior distributions are evaluated, with a
noninformative LogNormal hyper-prior ensuring flexibility. A simulation study
of seventy-two datasets with varying structures compares MCMC and classical
methods, identifying optimal priors for Bayesian regularization. The approach
effectively handles the Increasing Hazard Rate (IHR) and Decreasing Hazard Rate
(DHR) scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's utility by predicting
the remaining lifetime of prostate cancer patients, showcasing its practical
application. This work advances Bayesian methodologies for modeling complex
life systems and testing processes.

Conclusion: 提出的迁移学习方法能有效应对泛函线性模型数据稀缺问题，有良好应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the
challenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology
incorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from
auxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape
from the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge
transfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling,
ensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across
different source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity
represents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity,
allowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve
significantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence
rates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our
findings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity
of coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on
coefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional
covariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of
auxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a
data-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The
effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive
simulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using
physical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey.

Result: 使用多项式和高斯核的非线性分割生成的树与单变量和斜分割生成的树有相似预测能力，且规模更小。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了新颖且灵活的生存树，可应用于不同生存数据集。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel, node-splitting support vector machine (SVM) for
creating survival trees. This approach is capable of non-linearly partitioning
survival data which includes continuous, right-censored outcomes. Our method
improves on an existing non-parametric method, which uses at most oblique
splits to induce survival regression trees. In the prior work, these oblique
splits were created via a non-SVM approach, by minimizing a piece-wise linear
objective, called a dipole splitting criterion, constructed from pairs of
covariates and their associated survival information. We extend this method by
enabling splits from a general class of non-linear surfaces. We achieve this by
ridge regularizing the dipole-splitting criterion to enable application of
kernel methods in a manner analogous to classical SVMs. The ridge
regularization provides robustness and can be tuned. Using various kernels, we
induce both linear and non-linear survival trees to compare their sizes and
predictive powers on real and simulated data sets. We compare traditional
univariate log-rank splits, oblique splits using the original dipole-splitting
criterion and a variety of non-linear splits enabled by our method. In these
tests, trees created by non-linear splits, using polynomial and Gaussian
kernels show similar predictive power while often being of smaller sizes
compared to trees created by univariate and oblique splits. This approach
provides a novel and flexible array of survival trees that can be applied to
diverse survival data sets.

Result: 数据消融分析表明省略信噪比时度量变得有噪声，用基准数据集的数值示例展示了新度量。

Conclusion: 新提出的多校准度量是有效的，避免了基于分箱或核密度估计的度量的问题。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Conclusion: 分析似然函数是理解观点动力学模型及基于主体模型参数估计的陷阱和可能性的有效方法，能为模型校准提供形式保证。

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Result: 证明行列式过程适用于基于SINR的网络模型，凸显了行列式调度与公平性结合的潜力。

Conclusion: 该工作将机器学习与无线通信相结合，为网络调度提供了数学优雅且计算可行的方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for wireless network scheduling with fairness
using determinantal (point) processes. Our approach incorporates the repulsive
nature of determinantal processes, generalizing traditional Aloha protocols
that schedule transmissions independently. We formulate the scheduling problem
with an utility function representing fairness. We then recast this formulation
as a convex optimization problem over a certain class of determinantal point
processes called $L$-ensembles, which are particularly suited for statistical
and numerical treatments. These determinantal processes, which have already
proven valuable in subset learning, offer an attractive approach to network
resource scheduling and allocating. We demonstrate the suitability of
determinantal processes for network models based on the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Our results highlight the
potential of determinantal scheduling coupled with fairness. This work bridges
recent advances in machine learning with wireless communications, providing a
mathematically elegant and computationally tractable approach to network
scheduling.

Motivation: 在资源受限的物联网和边缘设备上实现会话级加密流量分类，满足严格的内存和计算限制。

Conclusion: 该方法能在严格硬件限制下为物联网网络实时分析加密流量提供可扩展、高效的解决方案，有效加强网络安全。

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

Result: 多数当前C - SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效，C - SEO采用者增多总体收益下降。

Conclusion: 当前多数C - SEO方法效果不理想，传统SEO策略更优，C - SEO存在拥挤和零和问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PankRAG具有较强的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Motivation: 现有科学检索和问答数据集与现实研究查询分布不匹配，无法满足科研人员对数据集信息的需求。

Method: 设计面向数据集的信息提取方法增强数据集表示；用认知分类学提出问题生成框架；设计基于大语言模型困惑度变化自动过滤合成答案的方法。

Result: 创建了包含61k问答的ScIRGen - Geo数据集，基准测试显示现有方法处理复杂问题推理能力差。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了满足科学界复杂信息需求的更复杂工具的发展。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Conclusion: 开源基准和框架，加速实用大语言模型代理的开发。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在多语言物体幻觉问题，现有方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出CLAIM方法，通过识别特定注意力头、估计语言转移向量、干预注意力输出，对齐跨语言视觉感知能力。

Result: CLAIM在POPE平均提升13.56%（西班牙语最高30%），在MME幻觉子集提升21.75%。

Conclusion: 多语言注意力差异在中间层最明显，中间层在多语言场景中起关键作用。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: 表明生成式语言建模技术可用于医疗事件数据，为序列医疗建模发展奠定基础。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的SPACE框架能有效解决大语言模型的事实性和忠实性幻觉问题，可同时提升两者性能。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: DCT可泛化到未见工具，能在广泛动态环境中实现可扩展和自适应的AI助手

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该框架是分析文本结构与读者参与度关系的新计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

Conclusion: ManyICL方法有效，缩小了上下文学习与专用微调的性能差距，代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Conclusion: 该方法为全注意力提供可扩展替代方案，能在不牺牲检索性能下实现大语言模型实际部署。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),

of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model

focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic

mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章介绍AssertBench基准，用于测量大语言模型在面对用户对同一事实矛盾断言时坚持自身判断的能力，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准研究了大语言模型的事实一致性和修辞鲁棒性，但在事实陈述的定向框架如何影响模型判断方面存在知识空白。

Method: 从FEVEROUS中采样有证据支持的事实，为每个事实构造两种框架提示，记录模型的同意情况和推理，根据模型在中性呈现时对相同声明的准确性分层结果。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在测量大语言模型在面对矛盾用户断言时“坚持己见”的能力。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs发展和广泛应用，其鲁棒性受关注，需全面术语和方法助力该领域发展。

Method: 先给出LLM鲁棒性的正式定义和数据收集协议，再从对抗鲁棒性、OOD鲁棒性、鲁棒性评估三个视角进行综述。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Motivation: 现有基准多为基于文本、以英语为中心且聚焦医学，难以全面评估大语言模型在不同医疗角色和高风险临床场景中的能力，需要新基准。

Method: 构建基于十门日本国家医疗执照考试的多模态基准KokushiMD - 10，用其对30多个先进大语言模型进行文本和图像测试。

Result: 虽有有前景的结果，但没有模型能在各领域稳定达到及格线。

Conclusion: KokushiMD - 10为评估和推进多语言、多模态临床任务中以推理为中心的医疗人工智能提供了全面且有语言基础的资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

TL;DR: 提出新的分词方法MATTER，结合材料知识，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以频率为中心的分词方法用于材料科学时会产生过度碎片化和语义损失，无法保持材料概念的结构和语义完整性。

Method: 基于在材料知识库上训练的MatDetector和在令牌合并中优先考虑材料概念的重排序方法，提出MATTER分词方法。

Result: MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别平均提高了4%和2%的性能，优于现有分词方法。

Conclusion: 强调了领域知识在科学文本处理分词策略中的重要性。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集集中在窄领域，限制泛化能力，与专有模型差距大，需构建新数据集来缩小差距。

Method: 采用两阶段管道构建数据集，第一阶段用混合数据选择技术从超1亿样本中精选740万条基础指令；第二阶段经两阶段过程合成150万条聊天指令。

Result: 对多个开源模型微调后，在基础和指令跟随基准测试中性能显著提升，InfInstruct - LLaMA3.1 - 70B在指令跟随任务上超GPT - 4 - 0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: 基础和聊天训练存在协同作用，为大语言模型整体发展提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

TL;DR: 提出一种剪枝方法SDMPrune，在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，聚焦MLP模块剪枝，在零样本基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署成本高，基于梯度的剪枝方法用单热标签计算梯度会忽略其他词的潜在预测，缺失关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失获取更准确梯度信息，聚焦MLP模块进行剪枝。

Result: 在大量零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，在1B规模开源大语言模型中表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效压缩大语言模型且不明显降低性能，代码和训练权重已开源。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: 现有端到端ASR存在领域不匹配问题，TTA可缓解但与语言模型重打分结合有挑战，本文提出SUTA - LM，实验显示其在多领域表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动语音识别（ASR）存在现实世界领域不匹配导致性能下降问题，虽有测试时自适应（TTA）方法，但TTA与外部语言模型结合存在此前被忽视的挑战，需解决。

Method: 提出SUTA - LM，它是基于熵最小化TTA方法SUTA的扩展，先通过自动步长选择机制，利用声学和语言信息进行可控自适应过程，再进行语言模型重打分优化输出。

Result: 在18个不同的ASR数据集上进行实验，SUTA - LM在广泛领域取得了稳健的结果。

Conclusion: SUTA - LM是一种简单有效的方法，能有效结合TTA和语言模型重打分，在多领域ASR任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: 大语言模型结合TTS和ASR用于语音钓鱼，具有可扩展性和欺骗性，构成重大安全威胁。

Method: 确定ASR转录步骤为漏洞环节，引入ASRJam框架注入对抗性扰动；提出利用自然失真的EchoGuard干扰器；开展39人用户研究与三种先进攻击对比。

Result: EchoGuard在破坏ASR和人类听觉体验上达到最佳平衡，整体效用最高。

Conclusion: EchoGuard在防御语音钓鱼的ASR环节效果良好，具有实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

Motivation: 探究语言模型是否随能力提升趋向人类推理模式。

Method: 应用ETR理论，用PyETR生成逻辑推理问题，评估38个语言模型在383个任务中的表现。

Result: 模型能力提升时，与ETR预测的人类谬误相符的错误答案比例增加，且与逻辑正确性无关联。

Conclusion: 语言模型会趋向包含人类偏见和局限的认知模式，挑战了语言模型自然获得规范理性的主流观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域应用时幻觉问题是临床使用的主要障碍，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出CHECK连续学习框架，集成结构化临床数据库与基于信息理论的分类器来检测幻觉。

Result: 在1500个关键临床试验问题上，将LLama3.3 - 70B - Instruct幻觉率从31%降至0.3%；分类器在医学基准测试中表现良好，AUC达0.95 - 0.96；提升GPT - 4o的USMLE通过率5个百分点至92.1%。

Conclusion: CHECK可将幻觉率抑制到临床可接受误差阈值以下，为医学等高风险领域安全部署大语言模型提供可扩展基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

<details>

Motivation: 提升ASR性能，尤其是在低资源或特定领域场景，且仅使用无标注数据集。

Method: 用现有ASR模型为未标注语音生成伪标签，训练高保真TTS系统，将合成语音文本对引入原ASR系统形成闭环自提升。

Result: 在台湾普通话语音上验证框架有效，Twister相比Whisper在普通话和普通话 - 英语代码切换基准上降低错误率分别达20%和50%。

Conclusion: 该框架是伪标签自蒸馏方法的有力替代，为低资源或特定领域场景提升ASR性能提供实用途径。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Conclusion: 参数小于1B的模型在这些任务中有竞争力，可在低预算GPU电脑甚至无GPU电脑上运行。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统探究课程学习在预训练语言模型中的应用，通过不同设置实验，发现课程学习可提升训练收敛性及性能，确定有效难度信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习在预训练语言模型中的潜力未被充分挖掘，进行首次系统研究。

Method: 采用不同课程学习设置，涵盖普通课程学习、基于节奏的采样和交错课程，依据六个难度指标进行实验，并在八个基准测试上评估模型。

Result: 课程学习在训练早中期持续提升收敛性，作为热身策略可带来最高3.5%的持久性能提升，确定压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性为有效难度信号。

Conclusion: 强调大规模预训练中数据排序的重要性，为实际训练场景下可扩展、数据高效的模型开发提供可行建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出新架构Avey，突破注意力和循环机制，能处理长序列，实验显示在NLP基准测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer处理长序列有局限，RNN并行性有限，需新架构解决问题。

Method: 提出Avey架构，由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，解耦序列长度和上下文宽度。

Result: Avey在多种标准短程NLP基准测试中与Transformer相当，在捕捉长程依赖方面表现出色。

Conclusion: Avey是一种有效且有潜力的新架构，可处理任意长序列。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出 Agent - RLVR 框架使 RLVR 在代理环境中有效，在软件工程任务提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 RLVR 在代理环境中效果差，奖励稀疏，导致模型训练失败率高。

Method: 引入 Agent - RLVR 框架，采用代理引导机制，利用多种信息线索引导代理，在训练循环中让代理先尝试、验证并补充引导，再重试并更新策略。

Result: Agent - RLVR 将 Qwen - 2.5 - 72B - Instruct 在 SWE - Bench Verified 上的 pass@1 性能从 9.4% 提升到 22.4%，结合奖励模型训练可进一步提升到 27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent - RLVR 为在复杂现实环境中用 RLVR 训练代理奠定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的韩语语法纠错系统，对比不同模型在韩语语法纠错任务中的表现。

Method: 用两个社交媒体对话数据集，对NLLB模型微调，使用特殊语言标记区分原文和修正句，用BLEU分数和“大语言模型作为评判者”方法评估。

Result: 微调后的NLLB（KoGEC）模型在韩语语法纠错任务中优于GPT - 4和HCX - 3，纠错更均衡，大语言模型较少关注标点错误，词汇扩展降低模型性能。

Conclusion: 为NLP领域提供高效、专业的韩语语法纠错系统和新评估方法，表明特定任务模型在专业NLP任务中可与通用大语言模型竞争。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究能否学习专用继续思考标记来触发扩展推理以提升模型性能。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek - R1中添加单个学习的<|continue - thinking|>标记，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，保持模型权重冻结。

Result: 学习标记在标准数学基准测试中比基线模型和使用固定标记的测试时缩放方法准确率更高，如在GSM8K基准测试中，固定标记方法绝对准确率提升1.3%，学习标记方法提升4.2%。

Conclusion: 学习的继续思考标记能有效提升模型推理的准确性，优于固定标记方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

TL;DR: 研究BERT是否编码抽象关系图式，发现预训练BERT有潜在关系信号，但关系图式需微调诱导，行为表现不意味概念理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究像BERT这样的大语言模型在语义任务上的表现是反映了真正的概念能力还是表面的统计关联。

Method: 通过检查概念对在分类、部分 - 整体和功能关系中的内部表征，比较BERT的关系分类性能和[CLS]标记嵌入的表征结构。

Result: 预训练BERT有较高分类准确率，表明有潜在关系信号；概念对在监督关系分类任务微调后才按关系类型组织。

Conclusion: 行为表现不一定意味着有结构化的概念理解，但模型可通过适当训练获得基于关系抽象的归纳偏差。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型对两种类型差异大的语言（阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语）文本标调的有效性。

Method: 引入新的多语言数据集MultiDiac，评估14种不同的大语言模型，与6种专业标调模型对比，用LoRA对4个小的开源模型进行约鲁巴语微调。

Result: 许多现成大语言模型在两种语言标调上优于专业模型，小模型有幻觉问题，小数据集微调可提升标调性能、降低幻觉率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在文本标调任务中有优势，小数据集微调有助于小模型改善表现。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

Motivation: 现有扩大语言模型规模的方法在特定领域任务尤其是小边缘侧模型上存在有效性和效率的局限。

Method: 提出LoRA - Gen框架，用云侧模型根据任务描述为边缘侧模型生成LoRA参数，通过重参数化技术将参数合并到边缘侧模型。

Result: 在推理任务中，无需专门训练就优于传统LoRA微调，TinyLLaMA - 1.1B有2.1倍加速；在智能代理任务中，Gemma - 2B压缩比达10.1x。

Conclusion: LoRA - Gen框架能促进模型间知识转移，显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

Motivation: 公开可用、标注良好的CRF数据集稀缺，限制了从临床笔记填充CRF的系统的发展。

Method: 提出半自动化转换方法，将信息抽取任务标注的数据集转换为结构化CRF，应用于E3C数据集的英、意两种语言。

Result: 在创建的数据集上实验，封闭大语言模型（零样本）下意大利语槽填充达59.7%，英语达67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的大语言模型，填充CRFs也具有挑战性。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

Motivation: 现有失忆探测技术在移除特定语言信息时存在难以仅移除目标信息而不改变其他信息的问题，且广泛使用的INLP技术会引入随机修改。

Method: 提出Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE两种替代方法。

Result: MP和LEACE能更有针对性地移除信息。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE增强了通过失忆探测获得行为解释的潜力。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能实现细粒度控制，还为建模更细微和依赖上下文的人类反馈提供机制。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

Result: 实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型实现更有效的长上下文建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

Method: 进行零样本角色提示，评估预测对反事实论点、不同角色提示和生成方法的稳定性。

Result: 能以约0.793的加权F1分数较好地模拟欧洲议会议员投票行为。

Conclusion: 零样本角色提示在预测个人投票决定和欧洲团体政策立场方面有一定效果，可较好模拟欧洲议会议员投票行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

Conclusion: 所提出的基于对比表征学习的防御框架有效，可提升大语言模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Result: 尽管存在各向异性，wav2vec2相似度度量仍能有效识别无转录的单词，这些表征具有鲁棒性，能捕捉语音结构并跨说话人泛化。

Conclusion: 强调了预训练在学习丰富且不变的语音表征方面的重要性。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

Motivation: 创建统一语音和音乐模型预训练成本高，直接合并未对齐模型有挑战。

Method: 受Git Re - Basin启发，提出相关排列方法，逐层计算置换矩阵最大化特征互相关性以合并模型。

Result: 合并模型保留语音能力，音乐性能显著提升，平均得分比线性插值模型合并高14.83分。

Conclusion: 可从独立训练的编码器创建统一音频模型。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级模块化架构，减少参数，实现与ControlNet相当音质和条件依从性，且灵活性高、内存使用低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音频扩散模型缺乏细粒度时变控制，ControlNet有内存占用大、控制集固定的问题。

Method: 提出轻量级、模块化架构。

Result: 经客观和主观评估，新架构在音质和条件依从性上与ControlNet相当。

Conclusion: 新架构灵活性更高、内存使用显著降低，能实现独立控制的高效训练和部署。

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the
accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

### [399] [Enabling automatic transcription of child-centered audio recordings from real-world environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11747)

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自动检测长时音频中可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的话语的方法，在四个英语语料库验证，能提升转录准确性，为儿童长时音频自动化语言分析迈进了一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时语音音频转录可用于丰富的语言分析，但大规模语料难以人工标注，现有的自动语音识别转录因真实音频的嘈杂和无约束性面临挑战且无成功应用案例。

Method: 提出一种自动检测长时音频中可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的话语的方法。

Result: 在四个英语长时音频语料库验证，该方法转录13%的语音时中位词错误率0%、平均词错误率18%；未过滤转录所有语音中位词错误率52%、平均词错误率51%；自动转录的词频与手动标注的词频有较高相关性。

Conclusion: 该工作为儿童长时音频的自动化语言分析提供了具体进展。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

TL;DR: 介绍抽象声音和声音融合概念，提出基于DPMSolver++采样器的SDE和ODE反转模型实现声音融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现原始声音和参考声音的融合，生成具有超越简单叠加听觉特征的新声音。

Method: 采用反转技术，提出基于DPMSolver++采样器的SDE和ODE反转模型，通过将模型输出设为常量来反转采样过程。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统舞蹈表演是动作响应音乐的单向关系，AI在舞蹈应用主要是从音乐生成编排，旨在建立舞者与音乐的双向互动。

Method: 采用多模态架构，根据舞蹈动作智能组合预录制音乐片段来创作连贯音乐作品。

Result: 通过对表演数据的相关性分析，展示了动作特征与音频特征间的新兴沟通模式。

Conclusion: 该方法将AI在表演艺术中的角色重新定义为响应式协作者，为专业舞蹈表演和大众即兴艺术表达拓展了可能性。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.
