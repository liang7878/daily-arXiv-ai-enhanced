Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from\ncomputer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate\nmulti-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These\nembeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural\nlanguage queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across\nfour similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the\nstrengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity\nmost effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages.

A comparative framework is applied to relational, document,\nkey-value, column-family and graph databases to assess scalability,\nconsistency, query expressiveness, operational overhead and integration ease.\nEmpirical data drawn from industry case studies such as Netflix, Uber, and\nShopify, and survey data illustrate real-life adoption trends and challenges.\nThese findings demonstrate that polyglot persistence increases adaptability ,\nperformance , domain alignment but also governance or operational complexity.\nTo cope with such trade-offs, architectural patterns such as saga workflows,\nevent sourcing, and outbox integration are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5bf9\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7ba1\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982saga\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6eaf\u6e90\u548coutbox\u96c6\u6210\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

It is important for these satellites to optimize the\ndata they collect and include only the most important or informative\nmeasurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite\nresources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently\nreconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that\ndynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered\nversus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different\nlearning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and\nimitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic\nprogramming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations.

However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy\nleaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy\nwithin a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.\nMost existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on\nhomogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose\npersonalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have\ndifferent privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,\nwe design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy\nrequirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism\n(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data\nstatistics while achieving $w$-event level $\\epsilon$ personalized differential\nprivacy ( ($w$, $\\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution\n(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the\nsame privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the\nprevious release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$\ntime slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time\nslots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that\nboth PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation\nmethods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic\ndata sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget\nDistribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA).

Few\nother results, mostly on \\textsc{Longest Path} and some generalizations of\n\\textsc{Matching Cut}, have also been developed. However, little success has\nbeen seen in enumeration versions of \\textsc{Vertex Cover} and \\textsc{Feedback\nVertex Set}, some of the most studied problems in kernelization. In this paper,\nwe address this shortcoming. Our first result is a polynomial-delay enumeration\nkernel with $2k$ vertices for \\textsc{Enum Vertex Cover}, where we wish to list\nall solutions with at most $k$ vertices.

To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been\nproposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the\ntraining availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and\nthe powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these\ndata are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,\nthey will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we\nfind that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.\nThis phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly\nunlearnable examples?

To this end, we observe the difference in the\nconvergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model\narchitecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of\nthe critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,\nimplying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.\nConsequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons\nfor UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the\nunlearnability of parameters based on this explanation.

In this work, we propose a new contact algorithm that\ncomputes contact forces by taking the gradient of an energy function of the\ncontact volume (overlap) with respect to the geometry descriptors. While\nelegant in concept, evaluating this gradient is non-trivial due to the\narbitrary geometry of the contact region. Inspired by the recently proposed\nFiber Monte Carlo (FMC) method, we develop an algorithm that accurately\ncomputes contact forces based on the overlap volume between bodies with complex\ngeometries. Our computational framework operates independently of mesh\nconformity, eliminating the need for master-slave identification and projection\niterations, thus handling arbitrary discretizations.

We evaluate SINDI on multiple real-world datasets.\nExperimental results show that SINDI achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross datasets of varying scales, languages, and models. On the MsMarco\ndataset, when Recall@50 exceeds 99%, SINDI delivers single-thread\nquery-per-second (QPS) improvements ranging from 4.2 to 26.4 times compared\nwith SEISMIC and PyANNs.

NeurIPS 2024", "summary": "This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)\nframework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied\nagents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large\nLanguage Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently\nexploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context\nmemory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying\nenvironment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency\nrefinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of\nknowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and\nCARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied\ninstruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and\ntypes, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal\nsuccess rate and execution efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExRAP\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fde\u7eed\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728VirtualHome\u3001ALFRED\u548cCARLA\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ExRAP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To overcome\npractical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network\nenvironments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively\ndetermine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by\n20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target\naccuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource\nbudgets compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDuplex\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFGL\uff09\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4DFGL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDuplex\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u56fe\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cDuplex\u51cf\u5c1120.1% - 48.8%\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c16.7% - 37.6%\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad83.3% - 7.9%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Duplex\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eDFGL\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Membrane, a system that (1) cryptographically\nenforces data-dependent access control views over a data lake, (2) without\nrestricting the analytical queries data scientists can run. We observe that\ndata lakes, unlike DBMSes, disaggregate computation and storage into separate\ntrust domains, making at-rest encryption sufficient to defend against remote\nattackers targeting data lake storage, even when running analytical queries in\nplaintext.

To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and\nalso the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce\nSWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,\nmirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and\nre-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing\nGym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on\nGitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable\ntasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have\ncurated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value\nof our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.\nPost-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit\nimprovements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the\ndataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the\nOpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on\nSWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and\nvalidates the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSWE - Mirror\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e40\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u751f\u621060671\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316Gym\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709Gym\u73af\u5883\u548cGitHub\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SWE - Mirror\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u955c\u50cf\u5230\u914d\u7f6e\u597dGym\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b60671\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540e\u5728OpenHands\u6846\u67b6\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c7B\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u63d0\u534721.8%\uff0c32B\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534746.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE - Mirror\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While AI systems promise\nefficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these\nworkflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little\nabout the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations\nsucceed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants\nto examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses\nto AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated\nthree factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden\nthrough required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We\ncollected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four\nperformance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and\nundercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions\nabout human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI\nerrors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect\nsuggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative\noutcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest\npredictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors.

For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the\nclients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round\ncommunication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of\nclipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee\nclient-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes\nprivacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching\nprovides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to\nsupply any additional desired privacy.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which\ndirectly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM\nto FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish\ntheoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a\nlogarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results\nconfirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive\nwith non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.\nMoreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical\nperformance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSGM\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SGM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528R\u00e9nyi - DP\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06SGM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eSGM\u9690\u79c1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u8349\u56fe\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0bSGM\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "SGM\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u539f\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated\nLearning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure\naggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest\nservers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy\nleakage through client-server collusion.

DSFL is evaluated on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in\nboth IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,\nincluding LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy\napproaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and\n68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar\nthreats.

This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution.

(2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a\nsuperordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear\nlegal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through\ncomparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors\nwithout full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already\nexists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more\nlegitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is\nreadily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the\nassumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on\nagentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,\nand harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions\nand concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of \"performative\ncompliance\" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but\nstrategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a\n\"Lex-TruthfulQA\" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)\nidentity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,\nand (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our\nconclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the\nfeasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across\nadversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic\nmisalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the\nsimulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30 'Law - Following AI' \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5b58\u5728 'performative compliance' \u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30 O'Keefe \u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 'Law - Following AI' \u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f53\u4ee3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u5931\u8c03\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 LFAI \u5b58\u5728 'performative compliance' \u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u5b8c\u6574\u4eba\u683c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46 LFAI \u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca6\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u5408\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u8c61\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Among 864 scans\n(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and\nrater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6\nfor the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.\nInter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41\nbetween the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and\nrater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two\nraters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and\nrater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)\nor between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated\nwith age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool\nmeasured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans\nacquired from older patients.

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio).

This\nis attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes\nfrom multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic\nboundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause\nimperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are\njust like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model\nDegradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;\nSide 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail\nto preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation\nsubspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and\ngenerate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM\noptimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical\ninvestigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and\nRegularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -\n(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic\nfusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve\ninformation capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which\nutilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision\nin our proposed Information Tinker.

The DeepONet\nthen exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with\nspatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients\nefficiently and accurately.\n  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries\nand the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial\nadvantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.\nOverall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent\nrepresentations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining\ngenerative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader\nengineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408VRRAE\u4e0eDeepONets\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982AE\u548cVAE\u4ea7\u751f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408VRRAE\u4e0eDeepONets\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0cVRRAE\u5f15\u5165\u622a\u65adSVD\uff0cDeepONet\u5229\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u70ed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Methods: Open-access\ndata from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.\nParticipants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets\n(121, 15, and 15 participants each).

Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and\nshow how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u76f8\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5b66\u79d1\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u65e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u542f\u53d1\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5c06\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9645\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

The distance of CFS,\nwhich plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS\nis applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies\non the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS\nignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap\nof the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the\nHausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski\n(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich\nthe studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation\nability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but\nthe information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the\nCF-H distance.

In this paper we show\nSAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.\nWe also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes\ncontributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse\nhardware and models during an open-source demo.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u6b65\u7684RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5SAPO\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528RL\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5404\u8282\u70b9\u7ba1\u7406\u81ea\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u63a8\u6f14\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5343\u8282\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SAPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6269\u5c55RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5e76\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAgentGym - RL\u6846\u67b6\u548cScalingInter - RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u65e0\u5230\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AgentGym - RL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u63d0\u51faScalingInter - RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u572827\u4e2a\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentGym - RL\u6846\u67b6\u548cScalingInter - RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u52a9\u529b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers.

However, maintaining\nconsistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to\nviewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to\ntracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a\nunified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.\nHowever, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density\ncaused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the\nquality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking\naccuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that\ncombines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration.

Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific\ngating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each\nframe, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.\nExperiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently\noutperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks.

For SE, Sparse MERIT\nimproves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and\nby 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline.

However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap.

In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring.

To address this gap, we\npropose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel\nCXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional\ninformation loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the\nTB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,\nsurpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,\n99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%\naccuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,\noutperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16.

We explore\nthe foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the\nPlanner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,\ncost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct\n(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this\ndesign, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection\nattacks by establishing control-flow integrity.

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images.

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple.

As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI).
