In wildfire response, such drones play a pivotal role in\nmonitoring fire dynamics, supporting firefighter coordination, and facilitating\nsafe evacuation. In this paper, we introduce AeroResQ, an edge-accelerated UAV\nframework designed for scalable, resilient, and collaborative escape route\nplanning during wildfire scenarios. AeroResQ adopts a multi-layer orchestration\narchitecture comprising service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), each\nperforming specialized roles. SDs survey fire-affected areas, detect stranded\nindividuals using onboard edge accelerators running fire detection and human\npose identification DNN models, and issue requests for assistance. CDs,\nequipped with lightweight data stores such as Apache IoTDB, dynamically\ngenerate optimal ground escape routes and monitor firefighter movements along\nthese routes. The framework proposes a collaborative path-planning approach\nbased on a weighted A* search algorithm, where CDs compute context-aware escape\npaths. AeroResQ further incorporates intelligent load-balancing and resilience\nmechanisms: CD failures trigger automated data redistribution across IoTDB\nreplicas, while SD failures initiate geo-fenced re-partitioning and\nreassignment of spatial workloads to operational SDs. We evaluate AeroResQ\nusing realistic wildfire emulated setup modeled on recent Southern California\nwildfires. Experimental results demonstrate that AeroResQ achieves a nominal\nend-to-end latency of <=500ms, much below the 2s request interval, while\nmaintaining over 98% successful task reassignment and completion, underscoring\nits feasibility for real-time, on-field deployment in emergency response and\nfirefighter safety operations."}

One promising but challenging\napproach is to deploy such a computational workflow over heterogeneous GPUs.\nUnlike conventional large-scale LLM pretraining, RL training generally\ndecomposes into three coupled stages, i.e., rollout generation, reward\ncomputation, and policy/value updates, which exhibit markedly different compute\nintensities, memory footprints, and communication patterns. Recent research\nshows that fully asynchronous RL training can disaggregate these stages across\ndisjoint hardware pools without sacrificing training stability, creating a\ngreat opportunity for real-world heterogeneous deployment. To this end, we\npresent AReaL-Hex, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous RL training system that\neffectively schedules how to execute rollout generation and policy model\ntraining over heterogeneous GPUs while enforcing data staleness bounds.\nConcretely, we use a two-phase scheduler: (i) a constrained search with MILP to\nselect per-stage parallelization strategies and workload assignments given a\nresource budget, and (ii) a graph-partitioning step that allocates\nheterogeneous GPUs and interconnects to maximize end-to-end throughput. Built\natop a fully asynchronous RL architecture, AReaL-Hex maps HBM-I/O-bound\ngeneration and compute-bound optimization to more cost-efficient resources and\nbalances their producer-consumer interactions to avoid both idleness and stale\nrollout trajectories. On the mathematical reasoning task with various model\nscales (1.5B, 7B, and 14B), compared to homogeneous deployments of\nstate-of-the-art asynchronous RL systems: (i) When maintaining the same total\nbudgets, AReaL-Hex delivers up to 1.50x higher training throughput; (ii) When\nachieving the same training throughput, AReaL-Hex results in up to 1.46x\nreduction in training cost."}

To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford\ncoloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue\nclassification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image\ntiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000\ntiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of\nMedicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++,\ndesigned to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an\nencoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors\nfrom tiles within each whole-slide image.

This paper is accepted at IEEE BigData 2025 (Short)", "summary": "Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used for enhancing the performance\nof graph collaborative filtering (GCF) for personalized recommendation. Since\ndata augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works\nhave designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users\nand items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the\nambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core\ninformation and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall\ncomplexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR\noutperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics. SCAR\nexhibits strong robustness across different hyperparameter settings and is\nparticularly effective in sparse data scenarios."}

Such flows have played a role in\nprevious routing algorithms, including Schrijver's Homotopy Method and\nunsplittable flows in directed planar single-source instances. Recently\nuncrossed flows have played a key role in approximation algorithms for maximum\ndisjoint paths in fully-planar instances, where the combined supply plus demand\ngraph is planar. In the fully-planar case, any fractional multiflow can be\nconverted into one that is uncrossed, which is then exploited to find a good\nrounding of the fractional solution. We investigate finding an uncrossed\nmultiflow as a standalone algorithmic problem in general planar instances (not\nnecessarily fully-planar). We consider both a congestion model where the given\ndemands must all be routed, and a maximization model where the goal is to pack\nas much flow in the supply graph as possible (not necessarily equitably).\n  For the congestion model, we show that determining if an instance has an\nuncrossed (fractional) multiflow is NP-hard, but the problem of finding an\nintegral uncrossed flow is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded\nnumber of faces. For the maximization model, we present a strong (almost\npolynomial) inapproximability result. Regarding integrality gaps, for\nmaximization we show that an uncrossed multiflow in a planar instance can\nalways be rounded to an integral multiflow with a constant fraction of the\noriginal value. This holds in both the edge-capacitated and node-capacitated\nsettings, and generalizes earlier bounds for fully-planar instances. In the\ncongestion model, given an uncrossed fractional multiflow, we give a rounding\nprocedure that produces an integral multiflow with edge congestion 2, which can\nbe made unsplittable with an additional additive error of the maximum demand."}

The use of RL for optimal trading\nstrategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our\nknowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading\nproblem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with\nregime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of\nposterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on\nforecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits,\nwhile hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable\nstrategies.

For\ninstance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network\nprocessing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework:\nSkip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based\nneural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer\narchitectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and\nranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference.

Leveraging survey data on\nindividual attitudes and high-frequency time-use diaries from Italian couples\nwith children, I construct a composite index that integrates stated beliefs\nwith observed household practices. Using structural equation modeling, I\ndisentangle latent tolerance of domestic violence from reported attitudes and\nvalidate the index against both individual and partner characteristics, as well\nas time allocation patterns. Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender,\neducation, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms\nare strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it.\nTolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time\nwith partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily\nreflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining\nstructures. Beyond advancing measurement, the findings highlight how cultural\ntolerance of domestic violence is embedded in household arrangements that\ninfluence fertility, labor supply, and the intergenerational transmission of\nnorms.

In usage-based contracts, moderate overconfidence\nincentivizes manufacturers to increase hardware innovation investment and\nimprove overall supply chain revenues, but may cause platforms to reduce\nsoftware innovation; under revenue-sharing contracts, overconfidence positively\nincentivizes hardware innovation and pricing more strongly, while platform\nsoftware innovation varies nonlinearly depending on the share ratio.

VI approximates a\ntarget density~$p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable\ndistributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can\nrecover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when\n$p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the\nreverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two\nimportant directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for a broader\nfamily of divergences, highlighting the properties of variational objectives\nunder which VI provably recovers the mean and correlation matrix. Second, we\nobtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and\nelliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates.

Leveraging survey data on\nindividual attitudes and high-frequency time-use diaries from Italian couples\nwith children, I construct a composite index that integrates stated beliefs\nwith observed household practices. Using structural equation modeling, I\ndisentangle latent tolerance of domestic violence from reported attitudes and\nvalidate the index against both individual and partner characteristics, as well\nas time allocation patterns. Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender,\neducation, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms\nare strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it.\nTolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time\nwith partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily\nreflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining\nstructures.

We argue\nthat LLM development should be fundamentally reoriented toward\ncapability-per-resource rather than capability alone. We present a theoretical\nframework demonstrating that resource-allocation decisions guided by gradient\ninfluence patterns can dramatically improve efficiency throughout the AI\nlifecycle. Our analysis shows that in transformer-based models, where a small\nfraction of parameters exert outsized influence (following heavy-tailed\ndistributions), three critical insights emerge: (1) updating only\nhigh-influence parameters strictly outperforms full-parameter tuning on a\nperformance-per-resource basis; (2) simple gradient norms provide\ncomputationally efficient proxies for identifying these high-influence\ncomponents; and (3) coordinated parameter and data selection yields\nmultiplicative efficiency gains, potentially reducing resource requirements by\norders of magnitude. Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose a\ntwo stage paradigm marginal-return pretraining for foundation developers and\ninfluence guided adaptation for downstream users bridged by gradient\nblueprints, metadata describing which parameters matter most for various tasks.\nThis capability-per-resource perspective transforms what were once considered\npragmatic hardware workarounds into theoretically optimal strategies,\ndemocratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while significantly\nreducing environmental impact.

Good IDs should exhibit two key properties:\nsimilar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should\nmaintain a distinct and unique ID.However, most existing methods ignore native\ncategory information, which is common and critical in E-commerce.

ComPilot\nestablishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given\nloop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting\nback legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this\nconcrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our\nextensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the\neffectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean\nspeedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original\ncode. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the\nstate-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases.\nThis experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively\nguide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening\npromising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization."}

In this\nwork, we introduce the Subtree Mode (SM) problem, the analogous problem in a\nleaf-colored tree, where the task is to compute the most frequent color in the\nleaves of the subtree of a given node.

The use of RL for optimal trading\nstrategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our\nknowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading\nproblem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with\nregime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information\nfrom the trading signal with latent parameters.\n  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are\nfiltered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived\nvia RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nnetworks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step\napproach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL\ntrader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of\nposterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on\nforecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with\nincreasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's\nparameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find\nthat prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more\ninterpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits,\nwhile hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable\nstrategies. Our results show that the quality and structure of the information\nsupplied to the agent are crucial: embedding probabilistic insights into latent\nregimes substantially improves both profitability and robustness of\nreinforcement learning-based trading strategies."}

Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge,\nbut these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to\ninaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect\nanswers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods,\nand their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To\naddress these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while\nmaintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that\nfirst retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to\nefficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length.\nThen we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority\nvoting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In\nparticular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the\nkey information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively\nperform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus,\nwe can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing\nthe response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting.\nExperimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance\nacross three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation\nand image captioning."}

This review examines this convergence across three\nprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather\nthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as\nconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual\ndependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or\nthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.\n  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems\nproduce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to\nsupply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics. Finally, both domains illuminate the phenomenon of\nscheming: automatic, goal-directed pattern generation that unfolds without\nreflective awareness. Hypnosis provides an experimental model for understanding\nhow intention can become dissociated from conscious deliberation, offering\ninsights into the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems.\nRecognizing these parallels suggests that the future of reliable AI lies in\nhybrid architectures that integrate generative fluency with mechanisms of\nexecutive monitoring, an approach inspired by the complex, self-regulating\narchitecture of the human mind."}

However,\nsuch workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct\noutput at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages,\ncompounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over\nnon-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the\nMonte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware\nverification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic\nworkflows."}

A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own\ntrade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,\nwhile Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes.

Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS\nintroduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction\nusing the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude\nis determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial\nexamples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model\ngeneralization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive\nexperiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art\ntransfer attacks.

This application presents unique challenges due to non-identical\ndistribution and feature characteristics of data captured at both locations.\nThe study makes several key contributions by evaluating FL algorithms in real\ndeployment scenarios rather than simulation. We compare several FL approaches\nwith a centralized learning baseline across key performance metrics such as\nmodel accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage. This\npaper also explores various FL workflows, comparing client-controlled workflows\nand server-controlled workflows. The findings of this work serve as a valuable\nreference for understanding the practical application and limitations of the FL\nmethods in segmentation tasks in UAV-based imaging."}

Our focus is on evaluating the\neffectiveness of fusing satellite and radar data for nowcasting.

We demonstrate\nthat this multimodal strategy significantly outperforms radar-only approaches.\nExperimental results show that integrating satellite data improves prediction\naccuracy, particularly for intense precipitation. The proposed model increases\nthe Critical Success Index for heavy rain by 4% and for violent rain by 3% at a\n5-minute lead time.

However, their large computational, memory, and energy demands are a\nchallenge for edge inference on FPGAs -- a field that has seen a recent surge\nin demand. We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table\n(LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraLUT, DWN, among others, in\noffering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute\nfootprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision\ntasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge\noptimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons\nwithin the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals\nthat a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer\n(MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously\ndevelop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to\nreplace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a\nneural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach\nallows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient\ninference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable\nworkloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and\n60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer. LL-ViT\neliminates over 60% of the model weights and 50% of the multiplications in the\nmodel, and achieves 1.9x energy efficiency and 1.3x lower latency over an\ninteger quantized ViT accelerator, while also offering superior throughput\nagainst prior works at a 10.9W power budget."}

We present a theoretical\nframework demonstrating that resource-allocation decisions guided by gradient\ninfluence patterns can dramatically improve efficiency throughout the AI\nlifecycle. Our analysis shows that in transformer-based models, where a small\nfraction of parameters exert outsized influence (following heavy-tailed\ndistributions), three critical insights emerge: (1) updating only\nhigh-influence parameters strictly outperforms full-parameter tuning on a\nperformance-per-resource basis; (2) simple gradient norms provide\ncomputationally efficient proxies for identifying these high-influence\ncomponents; and (3) coordinated parameter and data selection yields\nmultiplicative efficiency gains, potentially reducing resource requirements by\norders of magnitude. Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose a\ntwo stage paradigm marginal-return pretraining for foundation developers and\ninfluence guided adaptation for downstream users bridged by gradient\nblueprints, metadata describing which parameters matter most for various tasks.\nThis capability-per-resource perspective transforms what were once considered\npragmatic hardware workarounds into theoretically optimal strategies,\ndemocratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while significantly\nreducing environmental impact.

This work proposes scalable Processing-Near-Memory\n(PNM) for 1M-Token LLM Inference, a CXL-enabled KV-cache management system that\ncoordinates memory and computation beyond GPU limits. Our design offloads token\npage selection to a PNM accelerator within CXL memory, eliminating costly\nrecalls and enabling larger GPU batch sizes. We further introduce a hybrid\nparallelization strategy and a steady-token selection mechanism to enhance\ncompute efficiency and scalability. Implemented atop a state-of-the-art CXL-PNM\nsystem, our solution delivers consistent performance gains for LLMs with up to\n405B parameters and 1M-token contexts. Our PNM-only offloading scheme (PNM-KV)\nand GPU-PNM hybrid with steady-token execution (PnG-KV) achieve up to 21.9x\nthroughput improvement, up to 60x lower energy per token, and up to 7.3x better\ntotal cost efficiency than the baseline, demonstrating that CXL-enabled\nmulti-PNM architectures can serve as a scalable backbone for future\nlong-context LLM inference."}

In within-subject experiments, the fuzzy neural model performed better\n(68.58 percent +/- 13.76 percent accuracy, kappa = 58.04 percent +/- 18.43),\nwhile in cross-subject (LOSO) tests, the deep model exhibited stronger\ngeneralization (68.20 percent +/- 12.13 percent accuracy, kappa = 57.33 percent\n+/- 16.22). The study provides practical guidance for selecting MI-BCI systems\naccording to design goals: interpretability or robustness across users.

Unlike prior efforts, our generator\nis both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely\nhonoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the\ninitial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in\nestablishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs\nsubmitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship."}

Although recent deep learning-based\nmodels have shown significant success in forecasting intentions, few consider\nincomplete observation under occlusion scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose an Occlusion-Aware Diffusion Model (ODM) that reconstructs occluded\nmotion patterns and leverages them to guide future intention prediction. During\nthe denoising stage, we introduce an occlusion-aware diffusion transformer\narchitecture to estimate noise features associated with occluded patterns,\nthereby enhancing the model's ability to capture contextual relationships in\noccluded semantic scenarios. Furthermore, an occlusion mask-guided reverse\nprocess is introduced to effectively utilize observation information, reducing\nthe accumulation of prediction errors and enhancing the accuracy of\nreconstructed motion features. The performance of the proposed method under\nvarious occlusion scenarios is comprehensively evaluated and compared with\nexisting methods on popular benchmarks, namely PIE and JAAD.

Empirically, they are known to stabilize optimization dynamics\nand improve generalization. However, the underlying theoretical mechanism by\nwhich normalization contributes to both optimization and generalization remains\nlargely unexplained, especially when using many normalization layers in a DNN\narchitecture.\n  In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the role of\nnormalization through the lens of capacity control. We prove that an\nunnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with\nrespect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional\ncapacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In\ncontrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the\nLipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization\noperations. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1)\nit smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and\nmore stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the\nnetwork, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance.

Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers.

A common code construction\nuses a concatenated coding scheme that combines an outer linear block code with\nan inner code, which can be either a nonlinear marker code or a convolutional\ncode. Outer decoding is done with Belief Propagation, and inner decoding is\ndone with the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. However, the BCJR\nalgorithm scales exponentially with the number of noisy copies, which makes it\ninfeasible to reconstruct a codeword from more than about four copies. In this\nwork, we introduce BCJRFormer, a transformer-based neural inner decoder.\nBCJRFormer achieves error rates comparable to the BCJR algorithm for binary and\nquaternary single-message transmissions of marker codes. Importantly,\nBCJRFormer scales quadratically with the number of noisy copies. This property\nmakes BCJRFormer well-suited for DNA data storage, where multiple reads of the\nsame DNA strand occur. To lower error rates, we replace the Belief Propagation\nouter decoder with a transformer-based decoder.

CIFR captures cross-modal sequential interactions via cross-modal\ninterleaved feature representation. FFAE leverages auxiliary knowledge from\nopen-ended questions through free-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning,\nimproving the model's capability for open-ended Med-VQA. Experimental results\nshow that CMI-MTL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on three\nMed-VQA datasets: VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and OVQA.

On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego\nthis interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this\nwork, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP),\nwhich aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining\ninterpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes\nprocess to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the\nprocess into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time-\nand data-dependent dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP\nfamily, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark\ntasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the linearity of the recurrence,\nalbeit now piecewise and conditionally linear, the HHP also retains much of the\nstructure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct\nprobes into how the model creates predictions.

This survey reveals three\nimportant areas where quantum computing could potentially accelerate deep\nlearning, each of which faces a challenging roadblock to realizing its\npotential. First, quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication and other\nalgorithms central to deep learning offer small theoretical improvements in the\nnumber of operations needed, but this advantage is overwhelmed on practical\nproblem sizes by how slowly quantum computers do each operation. Second, some\npromising quantum algorithms depend on practical Quantum Random Access Memory\n(QRAM), which is underdeveloped. Finally, there are quantum algorithms that\noffer large theoretical advantages, but which are only applicable to special\ncases, limiting their practical benefits. In each of these areas, we support\nour arguments using quantitative forecasts of quantum advantage that build on\nthe work by Choi et al. [2023] as well as new research on limitations and\nquantum hardware trends. Our analysis outlines the current scope of quantum\ndeep learning and points to research directions that could lead to greater\npractical advances in the field."}

The research integrates\nthree core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand\nthe nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within\nreal-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing\n(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A\npurpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as\nthe foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI\nmodels such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their\nability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project\ncontributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but\nalso to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and\ncapable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of\nreal human language."}

This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how\nresistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The\nframework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience\nDegradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional\nIntegrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic\nstability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3\n8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question\nanswering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation.

However, centralized\nlearning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data\nownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing.\nCompounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that\nare both robust and adaptable.\n  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL\nplatform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a\nransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure.

We introduce the first open implementation of character training,\nleveraging Constitutional AI and a new data pipeline using synthetic\nintrospective data to shape the assistant persona in a more effective and\ncontrolled manner than alternatives such as constraining system prompts or\nactivation steering. Specifically, we fine-tune three popular open-weights\nmodels using 11 example personas, such as humorous, deeply caring, or even\nmalevolent. To track the effects of our approach, we introduce a method which\nanalyzes revealed preferences, uncovering clear and holistic changes in\ncharacter. We find these changes are more robust to adversarial prompting than\nthe above two alternatives, while also leading to more coherent and realistic\ngenerations. Finally, we demonstrate this fine-tuning has little to no effect\non general capabilities as measured by common benchmarks. We describe and\nopen-source our full post-training method, the implementation of which can be\nfound at https://github.com/maiush/OpenCharacterTraining."}

In such models, few-shot fine-tuning is a\nmajor challenge to achieve optimal performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, especially when labeled data is scarce.\nMost existing fine-tuning approaches rely on first-order gradient-based\noptimizers, which typically suffer from slow convergence, sensitivity to\nstep-size hyperparameters, and poor generalization in OOD settings. In\ncontrast, second-order methods utilize local curvature information of the loss\nlandscape to adjust the update step size.

In such cases, natural gradient direction can offer more substantial\nand efficient per-iteration updates when fine-tuning with limited data. Natural\nGradient Descent (NGD) is obtained by preconditioning the standard gradient\nwith the inverse Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which is computationally\nexpensive for large models.
