TL;DR: NAIAD利用大语言模型和外部分析工具，基于地球观测数据为内陆水监测提供整体解决方案，单提示界面可生成见解，性能良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内陆水监测方法常孤立处理子问题，需整体解决方案。

Method: 引入代理式AI助理NAIAD，通过RAG、LLM推理、外部工具编排等，从特定来源获取和合成知识生成报告。

Result: 用正确性和相关性指标评估，在涵盖多用户专业水平的基准测试中分别超77%和85%，初步结果显示适应性和鲁棒性强，消融研究表明Gemma 3 (27B)和Qwen 2.5 (14B)平衡计算效率和推理性能最佳。

Conclusion: NAIAD为内陆水监测提供有效整体方案，所选大模型在性能上有优势。

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

### [3] [Effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in Large Language Model agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05302)
*Mizuki Sakai,Mizuki Yokoyama,Wakaba Tateishi,Genki Ichinose*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究用重复囚徒困境游戏考察大语言模型（LLMs）人格引导对合作行为的影响，发现宜人性是促进合作主因，人格引导是行为偏见而非确定性控制机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽有研究表明赋予LLMs人格特质会影响其行为，但人格引导在受控条件下如何影响合作尚不明确，因此开展本研究。

Method: 基于大五人格框架，用大五人格量表测量GPT - 3.5 - turbo、GPT - 4o和GPT - 5的基础人格，比较基线和人格引导条件下的行为，并分析操控各人格维度极值的影响。

Result: 宜人性是促进所有模型合作的主导因素，其他人格特质影响有限；明确的人格信息增加合作，但也使早期模型更易被利用，后期模型合作更具选择性。

Conclusion: 人格引导是一种行为偏见，而非确定性控制机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

### [4] [Improving Enzyme Prediction with Chemical Reaction Equations by Hypergraph-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05330)
*Tengwei Song,Long Yin,Zhen Han,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文利用化学反应方程，提出知识增强超图模型Hyper - Enz预测酶 - 底物相互作用，实验显示比传统模型效果显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有酶 - 底物相互作用预测方法依赖的数据库稀疏且维护费力，缺乏足够训练数据影响传统模型泛化能力。

Method: 将化学反应方程表示为知识图中的三元组，使用知识图嵌入；提出Hyper - Enz模型，集成超图变换器和KGE模型；引入多专家范式指导学习。

Result: 与传统模型相比，平均酶检索准确率相对提高达88%，对级预测提高30%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在酶 - 底物相互作用预测中有效。

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 系统评估临床大语言模型中基于角色的控制，发现角色对性能影响具有上下文依赖和非单调性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色调节对高风险临床决策的影响尚不明确，需系统评估其在临床大语言模型中的作用。

Method: 系统评估不同专业角色和交互风格在不同模型和医疗任务中的影响，用多维评估方法评估临床分诊和患者安全任务。

Result: 医疗角色在重症护理任务中提高性能，但在初级护理环境中降低性能；交互风格影响风险倾向和敏感性且高度依赖模型；LLM评判排名和人类临床医生评估结果有差异。

Conclusion: 角色作为行为先验，会引入上下文依赖的权衡，而非安全或专业知识的保证。

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Motivation: 随着AI智能体在多智能体环境中运行增多，理解其集体行为对预测人工社会动态至关重要。

Method: 通过改编社会心理学中的经典视觉实验，研究AI智能体作为社会参与者对群体影响的反应。

Result: AI智能体存在系统性从众偏差，与社会影响理论相符，能力强的大模型在简单任务上从众性降低，但在能力边界仍易受影响。

Conclusion: AI智能体决策存在安全漏洞，凸显集体AI部署中设置保障措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

TL;DR: 本文尝试评估国际象棋中有限次作弊的潜在收益，并在常用引擎上测试算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际象棋作弊成重大问题，以往多数研究关注作弊检测，本文旨在评估有限次作弊的性能增益，助力遏制和检测作弊。

Method: 开发算法并在常用国际象棋引擎上进行测试。

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Cheating in chess, by using advice from powerful software, has become a major problem, reaching the highest levels. As opposed to the large majority of previous work, which concerned {\em detection} of cheating, here we try to evaluate the possible gain in performance, obtained by cheating a limited number of times during a game. Algorithms are developed and tested on a commonly used chess engine (i.e software).\footnote{Needless to say, the goal of this work is not to assist cheaters, but to measure the effectiveness of cheating -- which is crucial as part of the effort to contain and detect it.}

TL;DR: 本文提出用于声明验证的ART方法，可实现透明、可争议的判决，在多数据集验证中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险环境应用中因不透明性（输出缺乏解释且难以纠错）而受限，需要更可解释的声明验证方法。

Method: 提出ART（Adaptive Reasoning Trees）分层方法进行声明验证，从根声明开始分支，通过子论证的两两对决确定论证强度，并由裁判LLM裁决得出最终判决。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ART的结构化推理优于强基线。

Conclusion: ART为可解释声明验证建立了新基准，决策步骤更可靠清晰。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

TL;DR: 针对RAG系统回答开放域多跳问题存在检索崩溃和学习不稳定问题，提出PRISMA框架，实验显示其在多个基准测试上达SOTA且可高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在解决RAG系统回答开放域多跳问题时存在检索崩溃和学习不稳定问题，阻碍可靠部署。

Method: 提出PRISMA框架，采用Plan - Retrieve - Inspect - Solve - Memoize架构，通过两阶段GRPO优化各智能体能力。

Result: PRISMA在十个基准测试上达到了当前最优性能，且能在现实场景中高效部署。

Conclusion: PRISMA框架能有效解决RAG系统回答开放域多跳问题中的检索崩溃和学习不稳定问题，可用于实际部署。

Abstract: Answering real-world open-domain multi-hop questions over massive corpora is a critical challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery. Experiments show that PRISMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多模态框架MMUEChange分析城市环境变化，案例验证其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前遥感变化检测等方法依赖单一模态分析，有局限性，需新方法理解城市环境变化以助力可持续发展。

Method: 提出MMUEChange多模态代理框架，通过模块化工具包和模态控制器灵活集成异构城市数据。

Result: MMUEChange在任务成功率上比最佳基线提高46.7%，有效减轻幻觉。

Conclusion: MMUEChange能支持复杂城市变化分析任务，有实际政策意义。

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

TL;DR: 探讨评估AI系统能力时忽视答案不确定性的问题，提出概率范式及相关概念，建议按答案概率分层评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估AI系统能力方法忽视了专家提供的真实答案的不确定性，在医学领域这种不确定性影响很大，可能得出误导性结论。

Method: 引入概率范式从理论上分析真实答案确定性与得分的关系，提出预期准确率和预期F1等概念。

Result: 研究表明忽视真实答案不确定性会有误导性结论，还提出基于概率范式的评估方法。

Conclusion: 建立系统能力时应按真实答案概率分层评估，在整体性能低于80%时，分层评估很关键，可使性能比较更可靠。

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

Method: 对火灾疏散场景定性评估，确定关键失败案例，设计七项任务对LLM和VLM进行定量评估。

Result: 多个模型在ASCII导航中成功率为0%，模拟消防演练中指示机器人前往危险区域。

Conclusion: 当前LLM不适合直接部署在安全关键系统，99%准确率有误导性，依赖它们有不可接受的风险。

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Conclusion: 发布WildSci数据集以推动科学推理可扩展和可持续研究。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach. We release WildSci to enable scalable and sustainable research in scientific reasoning, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/JustinTX/WildSci.

Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Conclusion: CPSR框架能同时捕捉知识图谱的结构和语义信息，有效提升归纳式知识图谱补全任务。

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验表明模型可控性非常脆弱，且高度依赖实验设置。

Conclusion: 需要对模型可控性进行严格分析，从尝试控制转向先理解其基本限制。

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Conclusion: 将逻辑作为神经符号架构中的一等参数元素，有助于实现更鲁棒、模块化和自适应的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

Conclusion: 需要进行可见性敏感的安全评估和训练干预。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

Conclusion: DynaDebate 方法能有效提升多智能体辩论的效果。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Method: 提出BEPA方法，通过自滚动可达轨迹和动态更新缓存将专家轨迹转化为策略对齐指导。

Result: 在OSWorld - Verified上提升UITARS1.5 - 7B成功率，在MMBench - GUI和Online - Mind2Web上也有一致提升。

Conclusion: BEPA方法能有效利用少量专家轨迹训练端到端策略，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Motivation: 大多数具身 AI 研究忽略了安全关键领域的语言歧义问题，可能导致严重后果，为填补这一安全漏洞开展研究。

Method: 定义 Open - Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection 任务，构建 Ambi3D 基准，提出两阶段的 AmbiVer 框架收集多视图视觉证据，引导 VLM 判断指令歧义。

Result: 实验表明任务具有挑战性，验证了 AmbiVer 框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为更安全可靠的具身 AI 发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

*Shreya Shankar,Sepanta Zeighami,Aditya Parameswaran*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 介绍任务级联框架以降低大语言模型处理文档成本，比模型级联更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型级联框架存在优化空间，未充分利用部分文档、关联操作等信息来降低成本。

Method: 提出任务级联框架，用大语言模型智能体生成候选任务并组装级联，用迭代方法构建有效级联，还有提供统计精度保证的扩展。

Result: 在八个真实世界文档处理任务、90%目标精度下，任务级联端到端成本比模型级联平均降低36%。

Conclusion: 任务级联框架能有效降低使用大语言模型处理文档的成本。

Abstract: Modern database systems allow users to query or process unstructured text or document columns using LLM-powered functions. Users can express an operation in natural language (e.g., "identify if this review mentions billing issues"), with the system executing the operation on each document, in a row-by-row fashion. One way to reduce cost on a batch of documents is to employ the model cascade framework: a cheap proxy model processes each document, and only uncertain cases are escalated to a more accurate, expensive oracle. However, model cascades miss important optimization opportunities; for example, often only part of a document is needed to answer a query, or other related, but simpler operations (e.g., "is the review sentiment negative?", "does the review mention money?") can be handled by cheap models more effectively than the original operation, while still being correlated with it.
  We introduce the task cascades framework, which generalizes model cascades by varying not just the model, but also the document portion and operation at each stage. Our framework uses an LLM agent to generate simplified, decomposed, or otherwise related operations and selects the most relevant document portions, constructing hundreds of candidate tasks from which it assembles a task cascade. We show that optimal cascade selection is intractable via reduction from Minimum Sum Set Cover, but our iterative approach constructs effective cascades. We also provide an extension that offers statistical accuracy guarantees: the resulting cascade meets a user-defined accuracy target (with respect to the oracle) up to a bounded failure probability. Across eight real-world document processing tasks at a 90% target accuracy, task cascades reduce end-to-end cost by an average of 36% compared to model cascades, at a production scale.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的SQL方言翻译方法RISE，能处理复杂查询，在两个基准测试中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SQL方言翻译工具需大量手动工作，LLM处理长而复杂查询有困难，需新的翻译方法。

Method: 先使用方言感知查询简化技术得到简化查询，再用LLM翻译简化查询并提取翻译规则，最后将规则应用到原查询。

Result: RISE在TPC - DS准确率97.98%，在SQLProcBench准确率100%，分别比基线平均提高24.62%和238.41%。

Conclusion: RISE能准确处理复杂SQL查询，在方言翻译性能上优于传统基于规则工具和基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: Translating SQL dialects across different relational database management systems (RDBMSs) is crucial for migrating RDBMS-based applications to the cloud. Traditional SQL dialect translation tools rely on manually-crafted rules, necessitating significant manual effort to support new RDBMSs and dialects. Although large language models (LLMs) can assist in translating SQL dialects, they often struggle with lengthy and complex SQL queries.
  In this paper, we propose RISE, a novel LLM-based SQL dialect translation approach that can accurately handle lengthy and complex SQL queries. Given a complex source query $Q_c$ that contains a SQL dialect $d$, we first employ a dialect-aware query reduction technique to derive a simplified query $Q_{s}$ by removing $d$-irrelevant SQL elements from $Q_c$. Subsequently, we utilize LLMs to translate $Q_{s}$ into $Q_{s^{'}}$, and automatically extract the translation rule $r_d$ for dialect $d$ based on the relationship between $Q_{s}$ and $Q_{s^{'}}$. By applying $r_d$ to $Q_c$, we can effectively translate the dialect $d$ within $Q_c$, thereby bypassing the complexity of the source query $Q_c$. We evaluate RISE on two real-world benchmarks, i.e., TPC-DS and SQLProcBench, comparing its performance against both the traditional rule-based tools and the LLM-based approaches with respect to translation accuracy. RISE achieves accuracies of 97.98% on TPC-DS and 100% on SQLProcBench, outperforming the baselines by an average improvement of 24.62% and 238.41%, respectively.

Motivation: 提供可用于独立分析全球网络攻击行为的数据集，助力网络安全相关研究。

Method: 在2025年6月9 - 11日的72小时内，通过部署在微软Azure四个虚拟机上的三个蜜罐收集攻击事件，并为每个事件记录丰富元数据。

Result: 数据集包含132,425个攻击事件，发现攻击源IP、协议、时间和地理分布等方面的特征，如特定协议主导、特定时间高峰等。

Conclusion: 该数据集结合高分辨率时间信息、地理定位和协议元数据，能支持可重复的云规模网络威胁调查。

Abstract: This data article introduces a comprehensive, high-resolution honeynet dataset designed to support standalone analyses of global cyberattack behaviors. Collected over a continuous 72-hour window (June 9 to 11, 2025) on Microsoft Azure, the dataset comprises 132,425 individual attack events captured by three honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea, and SentryPeer) deployed across four geographically dispersed virtual machines. Each event record includes enriched metadata (UTC timestamps, source/destination IPs, autonomous system and organizational mappings, geolocation coordinates, targeted ports, and honeypot identifiers alongside derived temporal features and standardized protocol classifications). We provide actionable guidance for researchers seeking to leverage this dataset in anomaly detection, protocol-misuse studies, threat intelligence, and defensive policy design. Descriptive statistics highlight significant skew: 2,438 unique source IPs span 95 countries, yet the top 1% of IPs account for 1% of all events, and three protocols dominate: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Telnet, Server Message Block (SMB). Temporal analysis uncovers pronounced rush-hour peaks at 07:00 and 23:00 UTC, interspersed with maintenance-induced gaps that reveal operational blind spots. Geospatial mapping further underscores platform-specific biases: SentryPeer captures concentrated SIP floods in North America and Southeast Asia, Cowrie logs Telnet/SSH scans predominantly from Western Europe and the U.S., and Dionaea records SMB exploits around European nodes. By combining fine-grained temporal resolution with rich, contextual geolocation and protocol metadata, this standalone dataset aims to empower reproducible, cloud-scale investigations into evolving cyber threats. Accompanying analysis code and data access details are provided.

Motivation: 现实应用中空间数据集高度动态，需要对空间索引进行高效并行批量更新，但相关工作较少。

Method: 选择Orth树和R树/BVH两种适合低延迟更新的空间索引，提出并行的P - Orth树和SPaC树家族。

Result: P - Orth树和SPaC树在批量更新上性能优于现有并行kd树和Orth树，查询性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 通过实验对比了不同并行空间索引的性能并分享了研究结果。

Abstract: Maintaining spatial data (points in two or three dimensions) is crucial and has a wide range of applications, such as graphics, GIS, and robotics. To handle spatial data, many data structures, called spatial indexes, have been proposed, e.g. kd-trees, oct/quadtrees (also called Orth-trees), R-trees, and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs). In real-world applications, spatial datasets tend to be highly dynamic, requiring batch updates of points with low latency. This calls for efficient parallel batch updates on spatial indexes. Unfortunately, there is very little work that achieves this.
  In this paper, we systematically study parallel spatial indexes, with a special focus on achieving high-performance update performance for highly dynamic workloads. We select two types of spatial indexes that are considered optimized for low-latency updates: Orth-tree and R-tree/BVH. We propose two data structures: the P-Orth tree, a parallel Orth-tree, and the SPaC-tree family, a parallel R-tree/BVH. Both the P-Orth tree and the SPaC-tree deliver superior performance in batch updates compared to existing parallel kd-trees and Orth-trees, while preserving better or competitive query performance relative to their corresponding Orth-tree and R-tree counterparts. We also present comprehensive experiments comparing the performance of various parallel spatial indexes and share our findings at the end of the paper.

Motivation: 解决关于排名函数中列权重重要性的解释问题。

Method: 采用Grohe等人框架，分析不同排名函数（字典序、求和/最小/最大得分序）和效应函数（全局、top - k、局部视角）在概率独立有限分布下的计算复杂度。

Result: 所有情况都有加法完全多项式时间随机近似方案（FPRAS），确定了精确计算复杂度，区分多项式时间可解和#P - 难的情况。

Conclusion: 复杂度结果（上下界）可扩展到计算整列Shapley值的相关任务。

Abstract: How important is the weight of a given column in determining the ranking of tuples in a table? To address such an explanation question about a ranking function, we investigate the computation of SHAP scores for column weights, adopting a recent framework by Grohe et al.[ICDT'24]. The exact definition of this score depends on three key components: (1) the ranking function in use, (2) an effect function that quantifies the impact of using alternative weights on the ranking, and (3) an underlying weight distribution. We analyze the computational complexity of different instantiations of this framework for a range of fundamental ranking and effect functions, focusing on probabilistically independent finite distributions for individual columns.
  For the ranking functions, we examine lexicographic orders and score-based orders defined by the summation, minimum, and maximum functions. For the effect functions, we consider global, top-k, and local perspectives: global measures quantify the divergence between the perturbed and original rankings, top-k measures inspect the change in the set of top-k answers, and local measures capture the impact on an individual tuple of interest. Although all cases admit an additive fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS), we establish the complexity of exact computation, identifying which cases are solvable in polynomial time and which are #P-hard. We further show that all complexity results, lower bounds and upper bounds, extend to a related task of computing the Shapley value of whole columns (regardless of their weight).

Abstract: Direct access asks for the retrieval of query answers by their ranked position, given a query and a desired order. While the time complexity of data structures supporting such accesses has been studied in depth, and efficient algorithms for many queries and common orders are known, their practical performance has received little attention. We provide an implementation covering a wide range of queries and orders; it allows us to investigate intriguing practical aspects, including the comparative performance of database systems and the relationship between direct access and its single-access counterpart.

Motivation: 现有FDG方法存在跨客户端数据异质性问题且通信和计算开销大，需要改进。

Method: 提出轻量级Multi - Modal Style Transfer (MST)方法扩展训练数据分布；设计双提示模块，将提示分解为全局和域提示；引入Domain - aware Prompt Generation (DPG)自适应生成提示。

Result: 在四个跨域基准数据集上实验表明FaST - PT性能优于SOTA FDG方法，消融研究验证其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: FaST - PT能有效解决现有FDG方法的问题，具有良好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated Domain Generalization (FDG) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients that can generalize well on unseen domains. However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and efficiency of FaST-PT.

Motivation: 探究标准稀疏方法（如l1松弛和贪心追踪）在PCSG中能否可靠恢复最优联盟结构。

Method: 分析PCSG在重叠联盟产生高相干、近乎重复列情况下，标准稀疏方法的表现；证明SBL在相同结构假设下的支持一致性。

Result: l1松弛和k步正交匹配追踪（OMP）在特定情况下不可靠，有非零不可逆误选概率；SBL可抑制虚假近重复列，以趋于1的概率恢复真实联盟支持。

Conclusion: 在PCSG中，凸、贪心和贝叶斯稀疏方法存在严格差异。

Abstract: Probabilistic Coalition Structure Generation (PCSG) is NP-hard and can be recast as an $l_0$-type sparse recovery problem by representing coalition structures as sparse coefficient vectors over a coalition-incidence design. A natural question is whether standard sparse methods, such as $l_1$ relaxations and greedy pursuits, can reliably recover the optimal coalition structure in this setting. We show that the answer is negative in a PCSG-inspired regime where overlapping coalitions generate highly coherent, near-duplicate columns: the irrepresentable condition fails for the design, and $k$-step Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) exhibits a nonvanishing probability of irreversible mis-selection. In contrast, we prove that Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) with a Gaussian-Gamma hierarchy is support consistent under the same structural assumptions. The concave sparsity penalty induced by SBL suppresses spurious near-duplicates and recovers the true coalition support with probability tending to one. This establishes a rigorous separation between convex, greedy, and Bayesian sparse approaches for PCSG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传统数据集仅捕捉个体偏好，缺乏二阶信号，无法满足对同时利用一阶偏好和二阶预测进行排序算法的评估需求。

Method: 构建SP - Rank数据集，包含12000多个来自三个领域的人类生成数据点，涵盖九种不同子集大小的格式。通过对比仅使用一阶投票的传统聚合方法和联合推理两种信号的二阶方法SP - Voting来进行基准测试。

Result: 在三个核心任务上的评估结果显示，结合二阶信号的方法比仅使用投票的方法在准确性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: SP - Rank数据集不仅可用于社会选择，还支持学习排序、从嘈杂人群中提取专家知识等下游应用，对人类偏好建模、聚合理论和人机对齐的研究有促进作用。

Abstract: We introduce $\mathbf{SP-Rank}$, the first large-scale, publicly available dataset for benchmarking algorithms that leverage both first-order preferences and second-order predictions in ranking tasks. Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines. We release the dataset, code, and baseline evaluations (available at https://github.com/amrit19/SP-Rank-Dataset ) to foster research in human preference modeling, aggregation theory, and human-AI alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法存在局限性，GraphRAG存在信息提取低效、资源消耗大、增量更新适应性差等问题，需要新方法解决。

Method: 提出TagRAG框架，包括标签知识图谱构建和标签引导的检索增强生成两个关键组件。

Result: 在多个领域数据集实验中，TagRAG对比基线平均胜率95.41%，构建效率约为GraphRAG的14.6倍、检索效率约为1.9倍。

Conclusion: TagRAG能有效适应小语言模型，提高检索粒度，支持高效知识增量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving external knowledge to support informed and grounded responses. However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.

Motivation: 司法工作需阅读大量文件，有限人力下听证时详尽阅读不现实，尤其在印度法律文件冗长，需高效导航工具。

Method: CourtNav转录命令，用语法优先（精确正则匹配）和大语言模型支持的路由分类查询，通过布局感知混合索引检索，自动滚动并高亮显示相关内容，界面仅显示有依据段落。

Result: 在代表性文件试点中，定位相关内容的中位时间从手动的3 - 5分钟降至10 - 15秒，含快速视觉验证为30 - 45秒。

Conclusion: 这种以导航为优先的设计在固定时间预算下，增加了实际查阅记录的广度，同时保持了可控性和透明度。

Abstract: Judicial work depends on close reading of long records, charge sheets, pleadings, annexures, orders, often spanning hundreds of pages. With limited staff support, exhaustive reading during hearings is impractical. We present CourtNav, a voice-guided, anchor-first navigator for legal PDFs that maps a judge's spoken command (e.g., "go to paragraph 23", "highlight the contradiction in the cross-examination") directly to a highlighted paragraph in seconds. CourtNav transcribes the command, classifies intent with a grammar-first(Exact regex matching), LLM-backed router classifying the queries using few shot examples, retrieves over a layout-aware hybrid index, and auto-scrolls the viewer to the cited span while highlighting it and close alternates. By design, the interface shows only grounded passages, never free text, keeping evidence verifiable and auditable. This need is acute in India, where judgments and cross-examinations are notoriously long.In a pilot on representative charge sheets, pleadings, and orders, median time-to-relevance drops from 3-5 minutes (manual navigation) to 10-15 seconds; with quick visual verification included, 30-45 seconds. Under fixed time budgets, this navigation-first design increases the breadth of the record actually consulted while preserving control and transparency.

Result: 实验显示KP - Agent较基线能使累积利润最高提升49.28%。

Conclusion: KP - Agent系统在优化关键词集、提高赞助搜索广告活动性能方面有显著效果。

Abstract: Sponsored search advertising (SSA) requires advertisers to constantly adjust keyword strategies. While bid adjustment and keyword generation are well-studied, keyword pruning-refining keyword sets to enhance campaign performance-remains under-explored. This paper addresses critical inefficiencies in current practices as evidenced by a dataset containing 0.5 million SSA records from a pharmaceutical advertiser on search engine Meituan, China's largest delivery platform. We propose KP-Agent, an LLM agentic system with domain tool set and a memory module. By modeling keyword pruning within a contextual bandit framework, KP-Agent generates code snippets to refine keyword sets through reinforcement learning. Experiments show KP-Agent improves cumulative profit by up to 49.28% over baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的多阶段热点检测框架在处理新闻热点查询方面表现出色，能有效提升用户体验。

Abstract: LLM-based conversational systems have become a popular gateway for information access, yet most existing chatbots struggle to handle news-related trending queries effectively. To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of multilingual category relevance judgment in e-commerce search, where traditional ensemble-based systems improve accuracy but at the cost of heavy training, inference, and maintenance complexity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a simplified yet effective framework that leverages prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought task decomposition to guide reasoning within a single large language model. Specifically, our approach decomposes the relevance judgment process into four interpretable subtasks: translation, intent understanding, category matching, and relevance judgment -- and fine-tunes a base model (Qwen2.5-14B) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. This design not only reduces computational and storage overhead but also enhances interpretability by explicitly structuring the model's reasoning path. Experimental results show that our single-model framework achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency, processing 20 samples per second on a single A100 GPU. In the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup Competition Proposals, our method achieved 0.8902 on the public leaderboard and 0.8889 on the private leaderboard, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. These results highlight that structured prompting combined with lightweight fine-tuning can outperform complex ensemble systems, offering a new paradigm for scalable industrial AI applications.

*Zhen Yi Lau*

TL;DR: 本文将Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) 推广到任意度量空间，定义Generalized TWED (GTWED) 并证明其度量性质，还指出其可用于任意域序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将TWED推广到任意度量空间，以便在更广泛的数据类型上使用类似TWED的度量。

Method: 将观测和时间域视为度量空间，定义GTWED，并给出其度量性质的证明。

Result: 定义了GTWED，证明其在温和假设下是真正的度量，且经典TWED是其特殊情况。

Conclusion: GTWED的理论结构有助于将弹性距离扩展到时间序列之外，可用于任意域的序列。

Abstract: This short technical note presents a formal generalization of the Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) proposed by Marteau (2009) to arbitrary metric spaces. By viewing both the observation and temporal domains as metric spaces $(X, d)$ and $(T, Δ)$, we define a Generalized TWED (GTWED) that remains a true metric under mild assumptions. We provide self-contained proofs of its metric properties and show that the classical TWED is recovered as a special case when $X = \mathbb{R}^d$, $T \subset \mathbb{R}$, and $g(x) = x$. This note focuses on the theoretical structure of GTWED and its implications for extending elastic distances beyond time series, which enables the use of TWED-like metrics on sequences over arbitrary domains such as symbolic data, manifolds, or embeddings.

*Armin Gerami,Kazem Faghih,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出衡量文档影响的影响分数（IS），经实验验证其能有效量化文档影响，提升RAG系统透明度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估缺乏量化单个检索文档对最终输出贡献的指标，且RAG存在诸多影响可信度的问题。

Method: 引入基于部分信息分解的影响分数（IS）来衡量每个检索文档对生成响应的影响，并通过毒攻击模拟和消融研究两个实验验证。

Result: 毒攻击模拟中IS在86%的情况下正确识别恶意文档为最具影响力的；消融研究表明使用IS排名靠前的文档生成的响应与原始响应更相似。

Conclusion: IS能有效隔离和量化文档影响，是提升RAG系统透明度和可靠性的有价值工具。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge, improving accuracy and reducing outdated information. However, this introduces challenges such as factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities, which undermine the trustworthiness of RAG systems. A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线消费者评论数量增多导致信息过载，现有评论排名系统无法捕捉用户兴趣且分离处理文本情感和评分信号，影响用户决策效率。

Method: 通过星级评分和评论内容的混合分析建模用户情感，使用句子嵌入和聚类从历史评论中提取用户偏好形成语义轮廓，用相关性评分算法匹配未看过的评论，最后对匹配度高的评论进行总结。

Result: 70名参与者的用户研究表明，个性化方法提高了满意度、感知相关性和决策信心，减少了阅读时间。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效缓解信息过载，提供符合用户偏好的内容，对提升富评论决策环境下的用户体验有重要价值。

Abstract: Online consumer reviews play a crucial role in guiding purchase decisions by offering insights into product quality, usability, and performance. However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences. Existing review ranking systems typically rely on metrics such as helpfulness votes, star ratings, and recency, but these fail to capture individual user interests and often treat textual sentiment and rating signals separately. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests. A user study with 70 participants demonstrated that the personalized approach improved satisfaction, perceived relevance, and decision-making confidence, while reducing time spent reading. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in alleviating information overload and delivering content tailored to user-specific preferences, emphasizing its value in enhancing user experience in review-rich decision-making environments.

Conclusion: 提供了在先进LLM上构建IR模型的有效方法，揭示了信息检索能力与模型上下文长度的关系，有助于设计更好的信息检索器。

Abstract: Modern dense information retrieval (IR) models usually rely on costly large-scale pretraining. In this paper, we introduce LLM2IR, an efficient unsupervised contrastive learning framework to convert any decoder-only large language model (LLM) to an information retrieval model. Despite its simplicity, the effectiveness is proven among different LLMs on multiple IR benchmarks including LoCo, LongEmbed and BEIR. We also find that models with a longer context length tend to have a stronger IR capacity by comparing task performances of models in the same model family. Our work not only provides an effective way to build IR models on the state-of-the-art LLMs, but also shed light on the relationship between information retrieval ability and model context length, which helps the design of better information retrievers.

Result: 评估显示更新时内容再处理少、当前知识检索延迟低、跨版本历史时间查询延迟短、分层存储优化成本。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于需同时优化查询性能、更新效率和合规性的生产RAG部署。

Abstract: Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems struggle with a fundamental architectural tension: vector indices are optimized for query latency but poorly handle continuous knowledge updates, while data lakes excel at versioning but introduce query latency penalties. We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices). The approach enables production RAG deployments requiring simultaneous optimization for query performance, update efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of academic studies, industrial applications, and real-world deployments from 2018 to 2025, providing a practical guide and detailed overview of modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. RAG offers a modular approach for integrating external knowledge without increasing the capacity of the model as LLM systems expand.

We provide quantitative assessment frameworks, analyze the implications for trust and alignment, and systematically consolidate existing RAG techniques into a unified taxonomy. This document is a practical framework for the deployment of resilient, secure, and domain-adaptable RAG systems, synthesizing insights from academic literature, industry reports, and technical implementation guides. It also functions as a technical reference.

TL;DR: 提出跨文档主题对齐（CDTA）分块方法，在多数据集上表现优于现有方法，虽索引成本高，但对高查询量应用有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档分块方法存在知识碎片化问题，复杂查询需要跨多源信息，影响RAG系统性能。

Method: 引入跨文档主题对齐（CDTA）分块，先识别文档间主题，将段落映射到各主题，再合成统一块。

Result: 在HotpotQA和UAE Legal文本数据集上，CDTA分块的忠实度等指标优于上下文检索和语义分块等现有方法。

Conclusion: 对于高查询量且知识分散的应用，跨文档合成比文档内优化有显著改进。

Abstract: Chunking quality determines RAG system performance. Current methods partition documents individually, but complex queries need information scattered across multiple sources: the knowledge fragmentation problem. We introduce Cross-Document Topic-Aligned (CDTA) chunking, which reconstructs knowledge at the corpus level. It first identifies topics across documents, maps segments to each topic, and synthesizes them into unified chunks.
  On HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning, our method reached 0.93 faithfulness versus 0.83 for contextual retrieval and 0.78 for semantic chunking, a 12% improvement over current industry best practice (p < 0.05). On UAE Legal texts, it reached 0.94 faithfulness with 0.93 citation accuracy. At k = 3, it maintains 0.91 faithfulness while semantic methods drop to 0.68, with a single CDTA chunk containing information requiring multiple traditional fragments.
  Indexing costs are higher, but synthesis produces information-dense chunks that reduce query-time retrieval needs. For high-query-volume applications with distributed knowledge, cross-document synthesis improves measurably over within-document optimization.

Abstract: Industrial part specification extraction from unstructured text remains a persistent challenge in manufacturing, procurement, and maintenance, where manual processing is both time-consuming and error-prone. This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines. Key contributions include a scalable ensemble architecture for industrial domains, seamless RAG integration throughout the pipeline, comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms, and a production-ready solution suitable for deployment in knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于实时、对延迟敏感的网络服务。

Abstract: Evaluating complex texts across domains requires converting user defined criteria into quantitative, explainable indicators, which is a persistent challenge in search and recommendation systems. Single prompt LLM evaluations suffer from complexity and latency issues, while criterion specific decomposition approaches rely on naive averaging or opaque black-box aggregation methods. We present an interpretable aggregation framework combining LLM scoring with the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Our method generates criterion specific scores via LLM as judge, measures discriminative power using Jensen Shannon distance, and derives statistically grounded weights through AHP pairwise comparison matrices. Experiments on Amazon review quality assessment and depression related text scoring demonstrate that our approach achieves high explainability and operational efficiency while maintaining comparable predictive power, making it suitable for real time latency sensitive web services.

Result: 系统能在约4000万条记录的MEDLINE语料库中检索到连贯生物医学簇。

Conclusion: 通过纯几何评估该检索框架的性能，未定义召回率。

Abstract: We describe a PubMed scale retrieval framework that separates semantic interpretation from metric geometry. A large language model expands a natural language query into concise biomedical phrases; retrieval then operates in a fixed, mean free, approximately isotropic embedding space. Each document and query vector is formed as a weighted mean of token embeddings, projected onto the complement of nuisance axes and compressed by a Johnson Lindenstrauss transform. No parameters are trained. The system retrieves coherent biomedical clusters across the full MEDLINE corpus (about 40 million records) using exact cosine search on 256 dimensional int8 vectors. Evaluation is purely geometric: head cosine, compactness, centroid closure, and isotropy are compared with random vector baselines. Recall is not defined, since the language-model expansion specifies the effective target set.

Abstract: The recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution has opened transformative possibilities for the humanities, particularly in unlocking the visual content embedded in historical manuscripts. While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically study illustrations at a large scale remains challenging. Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations. This scale of processing in under 0.06 seconds per page, dramatically outperforms traditional segmentation techniques in both efficiency and accessibility for visual scholarship. Our work demonstrates how cutting-edge AI tools can profoundly reshape scholarly workflows and open new avenues for multidisciplinary research in the age of digital manuscripts.

Method: 提出分解验证框架，将复杂查询转换为基于事实的多轮对话，经过多层次验证，验证原子事实并生成每轮的显式检索推理。

Result: 结合对话历史和推理使检索性能翻倍（nDCG@10 从 0.236 提升到 0.479），推理专业模型大幅优于密集编码器。

Conclusion: 虽有性能提升，但隐式推理，尤其是文本中逻辑连接未明确表述时，仍具有挑战性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks treat multi-turn conversation and reasoning-intensive retrieval separately, yet real-world information seeking requires both. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark for reasoning-based conversational information retrieval comprising 707 conversations (2,971 turns) across eleven domains. To ensure quality, our Decomposition-and-Verification framework transforms complex queries into fact-grounded multi-turn dialogues through multi-level validation, where atomic facts are verified against sources and explicit retrieval reasoning is generated for each turn. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that combining conversation history with reasoning doubles retrieval performance (Baseline .236 $\rightarrow$ History+Reasoning .479 nDCG@10), while reasoning-specialized models substantially outperform dense encoders. Despite these gains, further analysis highlights that implicit reasoning remains challenging, particularly when logical connections are not explicitly stated in the text.

Conclusion: LEAPS有效解决现有电商搜索架构问题，已成功在淘宝AI搜索部署并服务大量用户。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has reshaped user search cognition, driving a paradigm shift from discrete keyword-based search to high-dimensional conversational interaction. However, existing e-commerce search architectures face a critical capability deficit in adapting to this change. Users are often caught in a dilemma: precise natural language descriptions frequently trigger zero-result scenarios, while the forced simplification of queries leads to decision overload from noisy, generic results. To tackle this challenge, we propose LEAPS (LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search), which seamlessly upgrades traditional search systems via a "Broaden-and-Refine" paradigm. Specifically, it attaches plugins to both ends of the search pipeline: (1) Upstream, a Query Expander acts as an intent translator. It employs a novel three-stage training strategy--inverse data augmentation, posterior-knowledge supervised fine-tuning, and diversity-aware reinforcement learning--to generate adaptive and complementary query combinations that maximize the candidate product set. (2) Downstream, a Relevance Verifier serves as a semantic gatekeeper. By synthesizing multi-source data (e.g., OCR text, reviews) and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, it precisely filters noise to resolve selection overload. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that LEAPS significantly enhances conversational search experiences. Crucially, its non-invasive architecture preserves established retrieval performance optimized for short-text queries, while simultaneously allowing for low-cost integration into diverse back-ends. Fully deployed on Taobao AI Search since August 2025, LEAPS currently serves hundreds of millions of users monthly.

Result: TMRL能有效适配多种文本嵌入模型，在时间检索和时间RAG性能上有竞争力，还能实现灵活的精度 - 效率权衡。

Conclusion: TMRL是一种提升时间检索和时间RAG性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrievers are a key bottleneck in Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems: failing to retrieve temporally relevant context can degrade downstream generation, regardless of LLM reasoning. We propose Temporal-aware Matryoshka Representation Learning (TMRL), an efficient method that equips retrievers with temporal-aware Matryoshka embeddings. TMRL leverages the nested structure of Matryoshka embeddings to introduce a temporal subspace, enhancing temporal encoding while preserving general semantic representations. Experiments show that TMRL efficiently adapts diverse text embedding models, achieving competitive temporal retrieval and temporal RAG performance compared to prior Matryoshka-based non-temporal methods and prior temporal methods, while enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: 点生成排序结合SToICaL损失函数的方法在信息检索排序任务中有效，能改善排序性能。

Abstract: Dual and cross encoders have long been mainstays of information retrieval (IR), but are being challenged by the emergent capabilities of LLMs. An LLM-based approach we term pointwise generative ranking - generating tokens the length of a single docID as opposed to a list in order to enable ranking via beam search - combines efficiency and expressivity benefits while leveraging the in-context capabilities of Causal Transformers. Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588). Two variants of SToICaL successfully suppress the probability of invalid docID generations and improve on common ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注经典文本搜索场景，本文旨在研究LLM与人类专家在音频转录文本相关性标注上的用户一致性以及分歧对系统排名的影响。

Method: 使用五种不同的LLM模型重新评估TREC 2020和2021播客轨道中由TREC评估员标注的查询 - 片段对，并重新评估LLM和TREC评估员分歧最大的一小部分对。

Result: 人类专家更倾向于与LLM而非TREC评估员达成一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了2002年Sormunen的观点，即依赖单一评估员会导致较低的用户一致性。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to annotate relevance is an increasingly important technique in the information retrieval community. While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement.

Motivation: 现有DIME依靠昂贵的网格搜索为所有查询语料库的嵌入选择先验维度，需改进。

Method: 提供一个基于统计的标准，在推理时直接为每个查询确定最优维度集。

Result: 实现了与原方法相当的有效性，在推理时不同模型和数据集上平均减少约50%的嵌入大小。

Conclusion: 提出的统计标准是有效的，可在效果相当的情况下减少嵌入大小。

Abstract: High-dimensional dense embeddings have become central to modern Information Retrieval, but many dimensions are noisy or redundant. Recently proposed DIME (Dimension IMportance Estimation), provides query-dependent scores to identify informative components of embeddings. DIME relies on a costly grid search to select a priori a dimensionality for all the query corpus's embeddings. Our work provides a statistically grounded criterion that directly identifies the optimal set of dimensions for each query at inference time. Experiments confirm achieving parity of effectiveness and reduces embedding size by an average of $\sim50\%$ across different models and datasets at inference time.

TL;DR: 提出内存高效的MoE训练框架MoEBlaze，解决内存墙瓶颈，实现显著提速和内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模混合专家（MoE）架构中“内存墙”瓶颈显著放大，架构稀疏性带来激活内存开销大等问题，限制GPU上的最大批量大小和序列长度，影响性能和模型扩展。

Method: 采用协同设计的系统方法，包括端到端令牌调度和MoE训练方法以优化数据结构，消除中间缓冲区和激活实例化；协同设计带有智能激活检查点的内核，减少内存占用并提高性能。

Result: MoEBlaze与现有MoE框架相比，可实现超4倍的加速和超50%的内存节省。

Conclusion: MoEBlaze能有效解决MoE架构中的内存问题，提升训练性能和效率。

Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型推理设计成本高、可审计性差，对话模型忽视时间结构，因此引入TIME框架。

Method: 提出TIME框架，用ISO 8601 <time>标签等增强对话，通过四阶段课程训练Qwen3模型，使用TIMEBench评估。

Result: 在4B到32B规模上，TIME在思考和非思考模式下都提高了TIMEBench分数，且减少约一个数量级推理令牌。

Conclusion: TIME框架有效，可提升大语言模型在时间推理等方面的表现，代码和数据均开源。

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude. Our training data and code are available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and TIMEBench is available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench

Method: 采用Forman - Ricci曲率捕捉图拓扑，用Deep Delta Learning实现约束投影时的稳定一阶扰动，用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略进行参数优化。

Result: 相比基线值11.68，平均能量降至1.15，约束满足任务成功率达95%，有种子无关收敛性和良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 拓扑结构可在不牺牲可解释性和计算效率的情况下为基于梯度的优化提供信息。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.

Method: 提出EquFL，服务器在收到客户端模型更新后生成单个校准更新，与聚合的客户端更新整合以调整全局模型。

Result: 理论上，EquFL收敛到FedAvg的最优全局模型，有效降低训练轮次中的公平性损失；实证上，显著减轻系统偏差。

Conclusion: EquFL能有效解决联邦学习中的公平性问题，具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的上下文提取和检索可提升长时血糖预测准确性和临床可靠性，无需额外传感器，支持糖尿病管理决策工具发展。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of blood glucose from CGM is essential for preventing dysglycemic events, thus enabling proactive diabetes management. However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian framework, but its performance depends critically on the choice of covariance kernel. Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效找到非单射函数给定目标变量的输入参数。

Abstract: Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\mathbf{x}^{\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\mathbf{x}^{\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\mathbf{y}^{\text{anchor}}$ to $\mathbf{y}^{\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.
  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.

Abstract: Accurate multistep forecasting of node-level attributes on dynamic graphs is critical for applications ranging from financial trust networks to biological networks. Existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks typically assume a static adjacency matrix. In this work, we propose an end-to-end dynamic edge-biased spatiotemporal model that ingests a multi-dimensional timeseries of node attributes and a timeseries of adjacency matrices, to predict multiple future steps of node attributes. At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons. Unlike prior work, our model accommodates dynamic graphs that vary across input samples, enabling forecasting in multi-system settings such as brain networks across different subjects, financial systems in different contexts, or evolving social systems. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Conclusion: HINT框架有效解决了知识蒸馏在多智能体强化学习中的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators of generative AI outputs, a paradigm often referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge." In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.

Result: 使用RingSQL生成数据训练的模型在六个文本到SQL基准测试中平均准确率提高2.3%。

Conclusion: RingSQL能在不同模式下保证SQL正确性，提供广泛语言多样性，可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

Abstract: Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.
  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

Abstract: Neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performances in various classification and regression tasks. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are often used as activation functions for the hidden layers in a neural network model. In this article, we establish the connection between the Poisson hyperplane processes (PHP) and two-layer ReLU neural networks. We show that the PHP with a Gaussian prior is an alternative probabilistic representation to a two-layer ReLU neural network. In addition, we show that a two-layer neural network constructed by PHP is scalable to large-scale problems via the decomposition propositions. Finally, we propose an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the classic two-layer ReLU neural network. The implementation of our proposed model is available at https://github.com/ShufeiGe/Pois_Relu.git.

Motivation: 大语言模型在代码优化时面临编写优化代码复杂和需解读性能指标两大挑战，因此探索引导其发现更好解决方案的方法。

Method: 提出MaxCode方法，将现有搜索方法统一在最大奖励强化学习框架下，集成自然语言批判模型增强观察空间，训练生成式奖励到目标模型改善搜索探索。

Result: 在KernelBench（CUDA）和PIE（C++）优化基准测试中，MaxCode相比基线提升了优化代码性能，绝对加速值和相对加速排名分别有20.3%和10.1%的相对提升。

Conclusion: MaxCode方法能有效提升大语言模型优化代码的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理模型任意更新下的审计，可应用于不同审计目标。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.

Motivation: 标准一阶优化微调大语言模型易陷入局部最优，零阶方法收敛慢且在生成任务中估计方差大、效率低。

Method: 提出Hi - ZFO混合框架，通过层重要性分析自适应划分模型，对关键层用一阶更新，对不敏感层用零阶优化。

Result: 在生成、数学和代码推理等多种任务中验证，Hi - ZFO表现优越，显著减少训练时间。

Conclusion: 分层混合优化用于大语言模型微调是有效的。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

Method: 从查询类型、模型类别、检索条件和多轮对话等多维度对过度搜索进行系统评估，引入Tokens Per Correctness（TPC）指标。

Result: 搜索通常提高可回答查询的答案准确性，但损害不可回答查询的弃权；复杂推理模型和深度研究系统过度搜索更明显，噪声检索会加剧该问题，多轮对话中问题会累积；负证据有助于弃权。

Conclusion: 研究了查询和检索层面的缓解方法，发布OverSearchQA以促进高效搜索增强大语言模型的持续研究。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市事故数据特性及治理、报告标准问题阻碍跨城市事故预防框架创建，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出MLA - STNet，将事故风险预测作为多城市多任务学习问题，包含STG - MA和STS - MA两个互补模块。

Result: 通过75次实验，与基线相比，RMSE降低6%，Recall提高8%，MAP提高5%，在50%输入噪声下性能变化小于1%。

Conclusion: MLA - STNet能有效统一异构城市数据集，构建可扩展、稳健、可解释的跨城市事故预防系统，推动数据驱动的城市安全管理。

Abstract: The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer计算和内存开销大，直接用Mamba做MTS分析有缺乏跨变量建模等问题，需要改进模型以适应MTS任务。

Method: 提出DeMa模型，分解MTS，设时间和变量两条路径，分别用Mamba - SSD和Mamba - DALA模块处理。

Result: 在五项典型任务实验中，DeMa取得了最优性能，计算效率高。

Conclusion: DeMa保留Mamba线性复杂度优点，提升了在MTS场景的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) analysis is increasingly critical for a wide range of intelligent applications. Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，HOPE在SOTA HGNN骨干网络上有一致提升，开销小。

Conclusion: HOPE框架可作为标准预测头的即插即用替代方案，有效解决线性投影瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs) have advanced mainly through better encoders, yet their decoding/projection stage still relies on a single shared linear head, assuming it can map rich node embeddings to labels. We call this the Linear Projection Bottleneck: in heterogeneous graphs, contextual diversity and long-tail shifts make a global head miss fine semantics, overfit hub nodes, and underserve tail nodes. While Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) could help, naively applying it clashes with structural imbalance and risks expert collapse. We propose a Heterogeneous-aware Orthogonal Prototype Experts framework named HOPE, a plug-and-play replacement for the standard prediction head. HOPE uses learnable prototype-based routing to assign instances to experts by similarity, letting expert usage follow the natural long-tail distribution, and adds expert orthogonalization to encourage diversity and prevent collapse. Experiments on four real datasets show consistent gains across SOTA HGNN backbones with minimal overhead.

Result: 使用真实数据集的计算实验表明，MILO 方法构建的评分系统 AUC 值优于基于正则化和逐步回归的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究推动了用于开发高可解释性分类模型的 MIO 技术的发展。

Abstract: A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.

Conclusion: 数值实验证明所提方法在不同能量和初始条件下具有准确性、稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

Conclusion: PaCoRe能在不超出上下文限制的情况下扩展TTC，并带来性能提升，开源资源以推动后续工作。

Abstract: We introduce Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe), a training-and-inference framework designed to overcome a central limitation of contemporary language models: their inability to scale test-time compute (TTC) far beyond sequential reasoning under a fixed context window. PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens. We open-source model checkpoints, training data, and the full inference pipeline to accelerate follow-up work.

Result: 在各种真实世界随机对照试验数据集上评估算法，用极少样本找到接近最优的治疗分配。

Conclusion: 治疗效果估计和治疗分配有根本区别，后者所需样本远少于前者。

Abstract: Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples.

Conclusion: DHPO能有效结合GRPO和GSPO的优势，在数学推理任务中表现出色，代码待论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising framework for optimizing large language models in reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO. We will release our code upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Time series are highly valuable and rarely shareable across nodes, making federated learning a promising paradigm to leverage distributed temporal data. However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in complex reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving. However, existing research predominantly relies on reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks while overlooking supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods. This paper proposes a new two-stage training framework that enhances models' self-correction capabilities through self-generated long chain-of-thought (CoT) data. During the first stage, a multi-turn dialogue strategy guides the model to generate CoT data incorporating verification, backtracking, subgoal decomposition, and backward reasoning, with predefined rules filtering high-quality samples for supervised fine-tuning. The second stage employs a difficulty-aware rejection sampling mechanism to dynamically optimize data distribution, strengthening the model's ability to handle complex problems. The approach generates reasoning chains extended over 4 times longer while maintaining strong scalability, proving that SFT effectively activates models' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and provides a resource-efficient pathway for complex task optimization. Experimental results demonstrate performance improvements on mathematical benchmarks including GSM8K and MATH500, with the fine-tuned model achieving a substantial improvement on competition-level problems like AIME24. Code will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: 提出的ETCL方法能有效实现无遗忘和正向知识迁移，提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: Existing research on continual learning (CL) of a sequence of tasks focuses mainly on dealing with catastrophic forgetting (CF) to balance the learning plasticity of new tasks and the memory stability of old tasks. However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.

Conclusion: 此统一观点为基于基础模型的因果发现和基础模型的可解释性增强奠定基础。

Abstract: We reveal that transformers trained in an autoregressive manner naturally encode time-delayed causal structures in their learned representations. When predicting future values in multivariate time series, the gradient sensitivities of transformer outputs with respect to past inputs directly recover the underlying causal graph, without any explicit causal objectives or structural constraints. We prove this connection theoretically under standard identifiability conditions and develop a practical extraction method using aggregated gradient attributions. On challenging cases such as nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems, this approach greatly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, especially as data heterogeneity increases, exhibiting scaling potential where causal accuracy improves with data volume and heterogeneity, a property traditional methods lack. This unifying view lays the groundwork for a future paradigm where causal discovery operates through the lens of foundation models, and foundation models gain interpretability and enhancement through the lens of causality.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting remains one of the most practical solutions for indoor positioning, however, its performance is often limited by the size and heterogeneity of fingerprint datasets, strong Received Signal Strength Indicator variability, and the ambiguity introduced in large and multi-floor environments. These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.

Result: 框架能为从业者提供可操作的安全保证，使其能设置更反映大语言模型实际行为的认证阈值。

Conclusion: 该工作为增强大语言模型对安全对齐利用的抵抗性提供了实用且有理论依据的机制。

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

Motivation: 探究稀疏自动编码器是否能识别大语言模型中的真正推理特征。

Method: 从标准对比激活方法选择的特征出发，引入结合因果token注入实验和大语言模型引导证伪的框架进行测试。

Result: 识别出的推理特征对token级干预敏感，多数可被token触发，未被触发的经证伪也不满足真正推理行为标准，控制这些特征对基准性能影响小。

Conclusion: 对比方法识别的SAE特征主要捕捉的是推理的语言关联，而非推理计算本身。

Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

Conclusion: 当前安全架构处理对话语境存在关键差异，需能抵抗叙事操纵的防御措施。

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

Conclusion: AGDC能在不同领域实现可扩展的高精度生成。

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

Conclusion: TRM在ARC-AGI-1上的性能源于效率、特定任务条件和大量测试时计算，而非深度内部推理。

Abstract: Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有低秩后训练量化方法需昂贵微调，SVD低秩近似增加计算开销，未能充分发挥潜力。

Method: 提出FLRQ方法，包含R1 - FLR和BLC两个组件，R1 - FLR用R1 - Sketch和高斯投影进行快速低秩近似，BLC用迭代方法在缩放和裁剪策略下最小化低秩量化误差。

Result: FLRQ在综合实验中展现出有效性和鲁棒性，在量化质量和算法效率上达到了最优水平。

Conclusion: FLRQ方法快速有效，能在保证量化质量的同时提高算法效率。

Abstract: Traditional post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective approach to reduce model size and accelerate inference of large-scale language models (LLMs). However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

Motivation: mHC存在有限SK迭代不保证双随机性及实现需专业CUDA内核的问题，需改进。

Method: 基于Birkhoff - von Neumann定理，提出mHC - lite，将双随机矩阵显式构造为置换矩阵的凸组合。

Result: mHC - lite性能匹配或超越mHC，训练吞吐量更高，消除了HC和mHC的残余不稳定性。

Conclusion: mHC - lite是一种更优的方法，代码公开。

Abstract: Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/mhc-lite.

Conclusion: 相比于追求像素完美重构，架构上优先考虑全局上下文约束对鲁棒的自监督P波检测至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate P-wave detection is critical for earthquake early warning, yet strong-motion records pose challenges due to high noise levels, limited labeled data, and complex waveform characteristics. This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce "overgeneralization", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in representation learning approaches that uncover the latent structure of high-dimensional data, this work proposes new algorithms for reconstruction-based manifold learning within Reproducing-Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 在多个眼动数据集上，DSTS优于传统机器学习技术和更复杂的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: DSTS框架能更有效地处理眼动数据，用于ASD检测。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep disorders, particularly insomnia and sleep apnea, is important for reducing long term health risks and improving patient quality of life. However, clinical sleep studies are resource intensive and are difficult to scale for population level screening. This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds. These results suggest that the proposed dual pipeline design supports accurate and efficient automated screening for non invasive sleep disorder risk stratification.

Abstract: Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable "parts-based" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the "parts" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

Conclusion: IIB - LPO方法有效，能实现最先进性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

Conclusion: 所提学习框架能消除任意边界匹配需求，得到全局有效解。

Abstract: In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.

Conclusion: 使用头包龄进行算法设计比虚拟队列长度更具鲁棒性，所设计的调度策略有效。

Abstract: The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to large-scale sensor networks that monitor environmental and urban phenomena in real time. Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.

Abstract: Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.

Conclusion: EET可以有效降低软件工程代理成本的同时保持任务性能

Abstract: Software engineering (SE) agents powered by large language models are increasingly adopted in practice, yet they often incur substantial monetary cost. We introduce EET, an experience-driven early termination approach that reduces the cost of SE agents while preserving task performance. EET extracts structured experience from prior issue-resolution executions and leverages it to guide early termination during patch generation and selection, reducing unproductive iterations. We evaluate EET on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark across three representative SE agents. EET consistently reduces total cost by 19%-55% (32% on average), with negligible loss in resolution rate (at most 0.2%). These efficiency gains are achieved, on average, by identifying early-termination opportunities for 11% of issues and reducing API calls, input tokens, and output tokens by 21%, 30%, and 25%, respectively. We release the code, prompts, and data at https://github.com/EffiSEAgent/EET.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) staking is one of the most prominent applications within the DeFi ecosystem, where DeFi projects enable users to stake tokens on the platform and reward participants with additional tokens. However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts. SSR detected that 3,557 (22.24%) of these contracts contained at least one logical defect.

Abstract: Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.

TL;DR: 研究评估9种大语言模型自动解决网页性能问题的效果，发现模型在SEO和可访问性问题上表现出色，在关键DOM操作上效果不一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对网页体验要求高，开发者在性能优化上耗时且手动操作困难，修改DOM是复杂任务，大语言模型为自动化解决提供新途径。

Method: 提取15个流行网页的DOM树和性能审计报告，将其输入9种大语言模型进行问题解决。

Result: 模型在SEO和可访问性问题上表现出色，在关键DOM操作上效果不一，如GPT - 4.1表现好，GPT - 4o - mini表现差，修改策略以添加和位置变化为主，影响视觉稳定性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在解决网页性能问题上有一定效果，但在关键DOM操作方面还存在差异和问题。

Abstract: Users demand fast, seamless webpage experiences, yet developers often struggle to meet these expectations within tight constraints. Performance optimization, while critical, is a time-consuming and often manual process. One of the most complex tasks in this domain is modifying the Document Object Model (DOM), which is why this study focuses on it. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue to automate this complex task, potentially transforming how developers address web performance issues. This study evaluates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs for automated web performance issue resolution. For this purpose, we first extracted the DOM trees of 15 popular webpages (e.g., Facebook), and then we used Lighthouse to retrieve their performance audit reports. Subsequently, we passed the extracted DOM trees and corresponding audits to each model for resolution. Our study considers 7 unique audit categories, revealing that LLMs universally excel at SEO & Accessibility issues. However, their efficacy in performance-critical DOM manipulations is mixed. While high-performing models like GPT-4.1 delivered significant reductions in areas like Initial Load, Interactivity, and Network Optimization (e.g., 46.52% to 48.68% audit incidence reductions), others, such as GPT-4o-mini, notably underperformed, consistently. A further analysis of these modifications showed a predominant additive strategy and frequent positional changes, alongside regressions particularly impacting Visual Stability.

Abstract: Automated unit test generation aims to improve software quality while reducing the time and effort required for creating tests manually. However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles. Our findings offer insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based oracle generation in the FM era, improving our understanding of their capabilities and fostering future research in this area.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex AI systems has outpaced the development of tools to ensure their transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. In this paper, the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), an extension of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is introduced as a standardized, verifiable record of trained AI models and their environments. Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job. The system uses cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and in-toto attestations to ensure integrity and protect against threats such as artifact tampering by dishonest model creators. Our evaluation demonstrates that AIBoMGen reliably detects unauthorized modifications to all artifacts and can generate AIBOMs with negligible performance overhead. These results highlight the potential of AIBoMGen as a foundational step toward building secure and transparent AI ecosystems, enabling compliance with regulatory frameworks like the EUs AI Act.

Abstract: The advent of transformer-based language models has reshaped how AI systems process and generate text. In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.

Motivation: 研究如何在神经网络模型中最佳输入历史赔付数据，并评估案件估计的预测力。

Method: 对比在汇总交易数据上训练的前馈神经网络和能够分析索赔完整赔付历史和/或案件估计发展历史的循环神经网络，并在多个由SPLICE模拟的复杂数据集上训练和比较模型性能。

Result: 案件估计能显著改善预测，而让神经网络具备记忆功能仅带来微薄改进。

Conclusion: 尽管不同保险公司的案件估计过程和质量差异很大，但可为评估其价值提供标准化方法。

Abstract: The use of neural networks trained on individual claims data has become increasingly popular in the actuarial reserving literature. We consider how to best input historical payment data in neural network models. Additionally, case estimates are also available in the format of a time series, and we extend our analysis to assessing their predictive power. In this paper, we compare a feed-forward neural network trained on summarised transactions to a recurrent neural network equipped to analyse a claim's entire payment history and/or case estimate development history. We draw conclusions from training and comparing the performance of the models on multiple, comparable highly complex datasets simulated from SPLICE (Avanzi, Taylor and Wang, 2023). We find evidence that case estimates will improve predictions significantly, but that equipping the neural network with memory only leads to meagre improvements. Although the case estimation process and quality will vary significantly between insurers, we provide a standardised methodology for assessing their value.

TL;DR: 提出DeePM深度投资组合管理器，解决金融学习三大挑战，回测表现优于经典策略和基准，且有结构韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融学习中的异步过滤、低信噪比和目标优化等问题，提升投资组合管理的风险调整后收益。

Method: 采用Directed Delay机制解决异步问题，用Macroeconomic Graph Prior应对低信噪比，优化分布鲁棒目标。

Result: 在2010 - 2025年大规模回测中，净风险调整后收益约为经典策略两倍，改进Momentum Transformer架构约50%，模型有结构韧性。

Conclusion: 严格滞后的横截面注意力、图先验、交易成本处理和鲁棒极小极大优化是模型泛化能力的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: We propose DeePM (Deep Portfolio Manager), a structured deep-learning macro portfolio manager trained end-to-end to maximize a robust, risk-adjusted utility. DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous "ragged filtration" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s "CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment. Ablation studies confirm that strictly lagged cross-sectional attention, graph prior, principled treatment of transaction costs, and robust minimax optimization are the primary drivers of this generalization capability.

Result: 在五种MFE场景验证，该框架能在未见过的激励下大幅度降低位移和旋转预测误差。

Conclusion: 所提方法为在固有建模不确定性下维护数字孪生准确性提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of structural dynamics is imperative for preserving digital twin fidelity throughout operational lifetimes. Parametric models with fixed nominal parameters often omit critical physical effects due to simplifications in geometry, material behavior, damping, or boundary conditions, resulting in model form errors (MFEs) that impair predictive accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for MFE estimation and correction in high-dimensional finite element (FE) based structural dynamical systems. The Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) represents discrepancies non-parametrically in the reduced modal domain, allowing a flexible data-driven characterization of unmodeled dynamics. A linear Bayesian filtering approach jointly estimates system states and discrepancies, incorporating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations. The proposed methodology offers a potential means to uphold digital twin accuracy amid inherent modeling uncertainties.

Result: BGM在预测性能上表现出色，预测区间校准良好，单一模型可用于条件预测和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: BGM框架结合AI能力和贝叶斯原理，是现代数据科学应用的有前景框架。

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires flexible conditional inference P(X_B | X_A) where (X_A, X_B) is an arbitrary partition of observed variable X. Existing conditional inference methods lack this flexibility as they are tied to a fixed conditioning structure and cannot perform new conditional inference once trained. To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds. The proposed BGM framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex relationships among variables while adhering to Bayesian principles, emerging as a promising framework for advancing various applications in modern data science.

Abstract: This brief note considers the problem of learning with dynamic-optimizing principal-agent setting, in which the agents are allowed to have global perspectives about the learning process, i.e., the ability to view things according to their relative importances or in their true relations based-on some aggregated information shared by the principal. Whereas, the principal, which is exerting an influence on the learning process of the agents in the aggregation, is primarily tasked to solve a high-level optimization problem posed as an empirical-likelihood estimator under conditional moment restrictions model that also accounts information about the agents' predictive performances on out-of-samples as well as a set of private datasets available only to the principal. In particular, we present a coherent mathematical argument which is necessary for characterizing the learning process behind this abstract principal-agent learning framework, although we acknowledge that there are a few conceptual and theoretical issues still need to be addressed.

Abstract: Modern engineering and scientific workflows often require simultaneous predictions across related tasks and fidelity levels, where high-fidelity data is scarce and expensive, while low-fidelity data is more abundant. This paper introduces an Multi-Task Gaussian Processes (MTGP) framework tailored for engineering systems characterized by multi-source, multi-fidelity data, addressing challenges of data sparsity and varying task correlations. The proposed framework leverages inter-task relationships across outputs and fidelity levels to improve predictive performance and reduce computational costs. The framework is validated across three representative scenarios: Forrester function benchmark, 3D ellipsoidal void modeling, and friction-stir welding. By quantifying and leveraging inter-task relationships, the proposed MTGP framework offers a robust and scalable solution for predictive modeling in domains with significant computational and experimental costs, supporting informed decision-making and efficient resource utilization.

Conclusion: 提出的方法非参数、无模型，仅依赖连续半鞅的通用小尺度结构，能有效区分扩散随机过程和确定性信号。

Abstract: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.

Conclusion: 为浅图卷积神经网络训练提供了网格和样本独立性的形式化表达。

Abstract: We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $Γ$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks.

Conclusion: 动态窗口无模拟PSRO能有效解决PSRO计算成本高的问题，具有较好性能和兼容性。

Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) combines game-theoretic equilibrium computation with learning and is effective in approximating Nash Equilibrium in zero-sum games. However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility. Our code is available at https://github.com/enochliu98/SF-PSRO.

Motivation: 传统广义典范多线性（GCP）分解未考虑张量的对称性，而现代应用中张量常存在对称性，因此提出SymGCP分解。

Result: 成功推导梯度，开发出可扩展到大型张量的随机SymGCP算法。

Conclusion: 通过对合成数据和真实数据的多种实验证明了所提出的SymGCP算法的实用性。

Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a workhorse algorithm for discovering underlying low-dimensional structure in tensor data. This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data.

Method: DNATok用基于字节查找表的标识符流替代通用字符串处理，采用固定内存和架构并行的重叠主机到设备计算管道。

Result: DNATok编码吞吐量比优化的Hugging Face基线高84 - 95倍，H2D吞吐量最高达1.9倍，端到端流处理可达1.27 - 1.84e8令牌/秒。

Conclusion: DNATok能有效消除分词在大规模训练和推理中的瓶颈。

Abstract: Tokenization sits at the boundary between high-throughput genomic input and GPU compute, posing challenges in both algorithm design and system throughput. Overlapping k-mer tokenization can introduce information leakage under masked language modeling (MLM) and may degrade downstream accuracy. Single-nucleotide tokenization avoids leakage and preserves per-base fidelity, but it greatly increases sequence length for attention-based architectures. Non-overlapping k-mers and byte-pair encoding (BPE) provide compression and avoid leakage, at the cost of boundary sensitivity or reduced interpretability. Empirically, the choice of tokenization interacts strongly with model architecture and task requirements. At the system level, however, standard string tokenizers and host-bound vocabulary lookups dominate wall-clock time once inputs reach billions of bases, regardless of the tokenization algorithm. We present DNATok, a high-performance, GPU-first tokenization system that replaces general-purpose string processing with byte lookup table (LUT)-based identifier streaming and an overlapped host-to-device (H2D)/compute pipeline using pinned memory and architectural parallelism. DNATok is vocabulary-agnostic: it accelerates single-nucleotide, non-overlapping k-mer, and BPE tokenization, and integrates as a drop-in systems layer beneath genomic foundation models. DNATok achieves 84-95x higher encoding throughput than optimized Hugging Face baselines and up to 1.9x higher H2D throughput. End-to-end streaming reaches 1.27-1.84e8 tokens/s depending on configuration, effectively removing tokenization as a bottleneck for production-scale training and inference.

Conclusion: OKR - CELL模型有效解决了现有模型的不足，在多模态应用中有良好表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.

Motivation: 为意大利小麦生产系统建立人工农场决策过程模拟框架，使农场做出更平衡和可持续的生产决策。

Conclusion: 通过内化环境影响信息，能帮助农场做出更平衡和可持续的生产决策。

Abstract: This paper presents a modeling framework for simulating the decision-making processes of artificial farms populating an agent-based model for the Italian wheat production system. The decision process is based on a mathematical programming model with which farms (i.e., agents) decide the target yield (production per hectare) and the mix of inputs needed to obtain such production, namely 1) fertilizers, 2) herbicides, and 3) insecticides. The environmental impacts of conventional production practices are assessed through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using the ReCiPe 2016 methodology at the Endpoint level. Agents are made aware of the environmental consequences of their choices through two indicators: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which capture human health impacts, and the number of species lost per year, reflecting impacts on ecosystems. By internalizing this information, agents can make more balanced and sustainable production decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用对x-haul网络提出更高要求，但毫米波易受天气影响，难以在不确定未来网络容量时进行准入决策，需改进网络性能、确保QoS和优化收益。

Method: 将深度学习预测器与基于主动Q学习的切片准入控制机制相结合。

Result: 使用真实数据验证，在动态链路条件下，主动式解决方案的长期平均收入提高2 - 3倍。

Conclusion: 所提框架为自适应准入控制提供可扩展且有弹性的解决方案。

Abstract: As emerging applications demand higher throughput and lower latencies, operators are increasingly deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) links within x-haul transport networks, spanning fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul segments. However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.

Conclusion: 多数多玩家多行动通用游戏是连通的，存在简单自适应动态能在几乎所有有纯纳什均衡的通用游戏中达到均衡，补充此前工作得到更完整游戏连通性图景。

Abstract: We study the typical structure of games in terms of their connectivity properties. A game is said to be `connected' if it has a pure Nash equilibrium and the property that there is a best-response path from every action profile which is not a pure Nash equilibrium to every pure Nash equilibrium, and it is generic if it has no indifferences. In previous work we showed that, among all $n$-player $k$-action generic games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, the fraction that are connected tends to $1$ as $n$ gets sufficiently large relative to $k$. The present paper considers the large-$k$ regime, which behaves differently: we show that the connected fraction tends to $1-ζ_n$ as $k$ gets large, where $ζ_n>0$. In other words, a constant fraction of many-action games are not connected. However, $ζ_n$ is small and tends to $0$ rapidly with $n$, so as $n$ increases all but a vanishingly small fraction of many-player-many-action games are connected. Since connectedness is conducive to equilibrium convergence we obtain, by implication, that there is a simple adaptive dynamic that is guaranteed to lead to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a vanishingly small fraction of generic games that have one. Our results are based on new probabilistic and combinatorial arguments which allow us to address the large-$k$ regime that the approach used in our previous work could not tackle. We thus complement our previous work to provide a more complete picture of game connectivity across different regimes.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型和生成式AI递归自训练中可能出现的问题及解决方法。

Method: 将递归自训练形式化为离散时间动力系统；提出基于算法概率指导的符号回归和程序合成方法（CTM）。

Result: 发现递归自训练存在熵衰减和方差放大两种基本失败模式；强化学习在不完善验证器下也有语义崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 纯分布学习导致模型崩溃，神经符号混合方法可为持续自我提升提供框架。

Abstract: We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($α_t \to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.

Result: PPM和ER网络的图能量在可检测阈值处有明显转变。

Conclusion: 标准图矩阵仍可用于区分社区可检测和不可检测的参数区域。

Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.

By constructing a legal citation network, we reveal the latent patterns of substantive and procedural law application. The findings demonstrate that SNA can effectively identify core legal norms and typify cases, offering a robust methodological framework for optimizing 'Digital Court' systems.

Abstract: Empirical models of demand for differentiated products rely on low-dimensional product representations to capture substitution patterns. These representations are increasingly proxied by applying ML methods to high-dimensional, unstructured data, including product descriptions and images. When proxies fail to capture the true dimensions of differentiation that drive substitution, standard workflows will deliver biased counterfactuals and invalid inference. We develop a practical toolkit that corrects this bias and ensures valid inference for a broad class of counterfactuals. Our approach applies to market-level and/or individual data, requires minimal additional computation, is efficient, delivers simple formulas for standard errors, and accommodates data-dependent proxies, including embeddings from fine-tuned ML models. It can also be used with standard quantitative attributes when mismeasurement is a concern. In addition, we propose diagnostics to assess the adequacy of the proxy construction and dimension. The approach yields meaningful improvements in predicting counterfactual substitution in both simulations and an empirical application.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for the function class implicitly learned by XGBoost, bridging the gap between its empirical success and our theoretical understanding. We introduce an infinite-dimensional function class $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ that extends finite ensembles of bounded-depth regression trees, together with a complexity measure $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$ that generalizes the $L^1$ regularization penalty used in XGBoost. We show that every optimizer of the XGBoost objective is also an optimizer of an equivalent penalized regression problem over $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ with penalty $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$, providing an interpretation of XGBoost as implicitly targeting a broader function class. We also develop a smoothness-based interpretation of $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ and $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$ in terms of Hardy--Krause variation. We prove that the least squares estimator over $\{f \in \mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}: V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(f) \le V\}$ achieves a nearly minimax-optimal rate of convergence $n^{-2/3} (\log n)^{4(\min(s, d) - 1)/3}$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Our results provide the first rigorous characterization of the function space underlying XGBoost, clarify its connection to classical notions of variation, and identify an important open problem: whether the XGBoost algorithm itself achieves minimax optimality over this class.

Abstract: This paper proposes a portfolio construction framework designed to remain robust under estimation error, non-stationarity, and realistic trading constraints. The methodology combines dynamic asset eligibility, deterministic rebalancing, and bounded multi-factor tilts applied to an equal-weight baseline. Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable. It provides a robustness-oriented alternative to parametric optimization and unconstrained multi-factor models, particularly suited for long-horizon allocations where stability and operational feasibility are primary objectives.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决SBOED的计算挑战，提高计算效率和性能。

Abstract: Sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design (SBOED) for PDE-governed inverse problems is computationally challenging, especially for infinite-dimensional random field parameters. High-fidelity approaches require repeated forward and adjoint PDE solves inside nested Bayesian inversion and design loops. We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework. We further introduce an eigenvalue-based evaluation strategy that uses prior samples as proxies for maximum a posteriori (MAP) points, avoiding repeated MAP solves while retaining accurate information-gain estimates. Numerical experiments on sequential multi-sensor placement for contaminant source tracking demonstrate approximately $100\times$ speedup over high-fidelity finite element methods, improved performance over random sensor placements, and physically interpretable policies that discover an ``upstream'' tracking strategy.

Abstract: Non-parametric distributional regression has achieved significant milestones in recent years. Among these, the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, a challenge remains in extending these grid-based approaches to a truly multivariate setting. In a naive non-parametric discretization with $N$ bins per dimension, the complexity of an explicit joint grid scales exponentially and the paramer count of the neural networks rise sharply. This scaling is particularly detrimental in low-data regimes, as the final projection layer would require many parameters, leading to severe overfitting and intractability.

Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid "ground truth" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) plays a critical role in materials science, enabling applications such as the construction of machine-learning interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations and the operation of self-driving laboratories. Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science.

Abstract: We introduce AutoMonitor-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of LLM-based misbehavior monitors across diverse tasks and failure modes. AutoMonitor-Bench consists of 3,010 carefully annotated test samples spanning question answering, code generation, and reasoning, with paired misbehavior and benign instances. We evaluate monitors using two complementary metrics: Miss Rate (MR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR), capturing failures to detect misbehavior and oversensitivity to benign behavior, respectively. Evaluating 12 proprietary and 10 open-source LLMs, we observe substantial variability in monitoring performance and a consistent trade-off between MR and FAR, revealing an inherent safety-utility tension. To further explore the limits of monitor reliability, we construct a large-scale training corpus of 153,581 samples and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruction to investigate whether training on known, relatively easy-to-construct misbehavior datasets improves monitoring performance on unseen and more implicit misbehaviors. Our results highlight the challenges of reliable, scalable misbehavior monitoring and motivate future work on task-aware designing and training strategies for LLM-based monitors.

Result: 发现即使意图理解和工具选择正确仍有很多失败，参数值语言不匹配是主要失败模式，推理策略可减少语言导致的执行错误。

Conclusion: 推理策略虽能减少错误，但无法完全恢复到英语水平的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that invoke external tools through structured function calls. While recent work reports strong tool-calling performance under standard English-centric evaluations, the robustness of tool calling under multilingual user interactions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.

Motivation: 不清楚大语言模型产生的类人道德判断是源于内部概念结构还是表面模仿，需研究其道德基础的编码等情况。

Method: 以道德基础理论为框架，采用多层次方法，包括对概念表示的逐层分析、使用预训练稀疏自动编码器、进行因果操纵干预。

Result: 两个模型以结构化、依赖层的方式表征和区分道德基础，与人类判断一致；稀疏自动编码器特征与特定基础有语义联系；操纵可使基础相关行为产生可预测的变化。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的道德概念是分布式、分层且部分解耦的，多元道德结构可从语言统计规律中作为潜在模式出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce human-like moral judgments, but it is unclear whether this reflects an internal conceptual structure or superficial ``moral mimicry.'' Using Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) as an analytic framework, we study how moral foundations are encoded, organized, and expressed within two instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. We employ a multi-level approach combining (i) layer-wise analysis of MFT concept representations and their alignment with human moral perceptions, (ii) pretrained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) over the residual stream to identify sparse features that support moral concepts, and (iii) causal steering interventions using dense MFT vectors and sparse SAE features. We find that both models represent and distinguish moral foundations in a structured, layer-dependent way that aligns with human judgments. At a finer scale, SAE features show clear semantic links to specific foundations, suggesting partially disentangled mechanisms within shared representations. Finally, steering along either dense vectors or sparse features produces predictable shifts in foundation-relevant behavior, demonstrating a causal connection between internal representations and moral outputs. Together, our results provide mechanistic evidence that moral concepts in LLMs are distributed, layered, and partly disentangled, suggesting that pluralistic moral structure can emerge as a latent pattern from the statistical regularities of language alone.

Conclusion: 所提混合框架能有效平衡交易分析的解释性与运营效率。

Abstract: The ubiquity of payment networks generates vast transactional data encoding rich consumer and merchant behavioral patterns. Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through superior semantic understanding, their computational overhead challenges real-time financial deployment. We introduce a hybrid framework that uses LLM-generated embeddings as semantic initializations for lightweight transaction models, balancing interpretability with operational efficiency. Our approach employs multi-source data fusion to enrich merchant categorical fields and a one-word constraint principle for consistent embedding generation across LLM architectures. We systematically address data quality through noise filtering and context-aware enrichment. Experiments on large-scale transaction datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple transaction understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and self-correction abilities in high-resource languages like English, but their performance remains limited in low-resource languages such as Korean. In this study, we investigate whether reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance Korean reasoning abilities to a degree comparable to English. Our findings reveal that RL alone yields limited improvements when applied to models lacking inherent Korean reasoning capabilities. To address this, we explore several fine-tuning strategies and show that aligning the model's internal reasoning processes with Korean inputs-particularly by tuning Korean-specific neurons in early layers-is key to unlocking RL's effectiveness. We introduce a self-correction code-switching dataset to facilitate this alignment and observe significant performance gains in both mathematical reasoning and self-correction tasks. Ultimately, we conclude that the crucial factor in multilingual reasoning enhancement is not injecting new linguistic knowledge, but effectively eliciting and aligning existing reasoning capabilities. Our study provides a new perspective on how internal translation and neuron-level tuning contribute to multilingual reasoning alignment in LLMs.

Result: 在安全、生物医学和金融领域的实验表明，ReasonAny能有效合成“推理 + X”能力，显著优于现有基线并保持强大推理性能。

Conclusion: ReasonAny是一种有效的解决“推理 + X”合并问题的方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with long chain-of-thought reasoning have recently achieved remarkable success. Yet, equipping domain-specialized models with such reasoning capabilities, referred to as "Reasoning + X", remains a significant challenge. While model merging offers a promising training-free solution, existing methods often suffer from a destructive performance collapse: existing methods tend to both weaken reasoning depth and compromise domain-specific utility. Interestingly, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon underlying this failure: reasoning ability predominantly resides in parameter regions with low gradient sensitivity, contrary to the common assumption that domain capabilities correspond to high-magnitude parameters. Motivated by this insight, we propose ReasonAny, a novel merging framework that resolves the reasoning-domain performance collapse through Contrastive Gradient Identification. Experiments across safety, biomedicine, and finance domains show that ReasonAny effectively synthesizes "Reasoning + X" capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while retaining robust reasoning performance.

Result: 在多轮对话的广泛实验中，该方法显著优于现有基线，并降低了token消耗。

Conclusion: ACR框架能有效解决大语言模型多轮对话中的问题，具有较好性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-turn dialogue. However, in multi-turn dialogue, models still struggle to stay aligned with what has been established earlier, follow dependencies across many turns, and avoid drifting into incorrect facts as the interaction grows longer. Existing approaches primarily focus on extending the context window, introducing external memory, or applying context compression, yet these methods still face limitations such as \textbf{contextual inertia} and \textbf{state drift}. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{(ACR)} Framework, which dynamically monitors and reshapes the interaction history to mitigate contextual inertia and state drift actively. ACR is built on a library of context refactoring operators and a teacher-guided self-evolving training paradigm that learns when to intervene and how to refactor, thereby decoupling context management from the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on multi-turn dialogue demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines while reducing token consumption.

Result: 在ChangeMyView Reddit数据集上，多个预测模型效果比现有方法有提升，F1分数最多提高13.77%。

Conclusion: 任务导向、上下文依赖的用户画像对个性化说服性预测有重要意义。

Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.

Result: Stephanie2在自然度和参与度等指标上明显优于Stephanie1，在角色识别图灵测试的人工评估中通过率更高。

Conclusion: Stephanie2能解决现有分步AI聊天系统的问题，实现更自然的节奏。

Abstract: Instant-messaging human social chat typically progresses through a sequence of short messages. Existing step-by-step AI chatting systems typically split a one-shot generation into multiple messages and send them sequentially, but they lack an active waiting mechanism and exhibit unnatural message pacing. In order to address these issues, we propose Stephanie2, a novel next-generation step-wise decision-making dialogue agent. With active waiting and message-pace adaptation, Stephanie2 explicitly decides at each step whether to send or wait, and models latency as the sum of thinking time and typing time to achieve more natural pacing. We further introduce a time-window-based dual-agent dialogue system to generate pseudo dialogue histories for human and automatic evaluations. Experiments show that Stephanie2 clearly outperforms Stephanie1 on metrics such as naturalness and engagement, and achieves a higher pass rate on human evaluation with the role identification Turing test.

Abstract: As multilingual large language models become more widely used, ensuring their safety and fairness across diverse linguistic contexts presents unique challenges. While existing research on machine unlearning has primarily focused on monolingual settings, typically English, multilingual environments introduce additional complexities due to cross-lingual knowledge transfer and biases embedded in both pretraining and fine-tuning data. In this work, we study multilingual unlearning using the Aya-Expanse 8B model under two settings: (1) data unlearning and (2) concept unlearning. We extend benchmarks for factual knowledge and stereotypes to ten languages through translation: English, French, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Farsi, Korean, Hindi, Hebrew, and Indonesian. These languages span five language families and a wide range of resource levels. Our experiments show that unlearning in high-resource languages is generally more stable, with asymmetric transfer effects observed between typologically related languages. Furthermore, our analysis of linguistic distances indicates that syntactic similarity is the strongest predictor of cross-lingual unlearning behavior.

Conclusion: MICL能提高ASR性能，跨语言迁移学习在不使用目标语言数据时可媲美或超越语料库训练的语言模型。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) still covers only a small fraction of the world's languages, mainly due to supervised data scarcity. In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) addresses this problem, but prior work largely focuses on high-resource languages covered during training and text-only settings. This paper investigates whether speech LLMs can learn unseen languages with multimodal ICL (MICL), and how this learning can be used to improve ASR. We conduct experiments with two speech LLMs, Phi-4 and Qwen3-Omni, on three diverse endangered languages. Firstly, we find that MICL is effective for unseen languages, leveraging both speech and text modalities. We further show that cross-lingual transfer learning improves MICL efficiency on target languages without training on them. Moreover, we analyze attention patterns to interpret MICL mechanisms, and we observe layer-dependent preferences between audio and text context, with an overall bias towards text. Finally, we show that prompt-based ASR with speech LLMs performs poorly on unseen languages, motivating a simple ASR system that combines a stronger acoustic model with a speech LLM via MICL-based selection of acoustic hypotheses. Results show that MICL consistently improves ASR performance, and that cross-lingual transfer learning matches or outperforms corpus-trained language models without using target-language data. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) represent natural language is a central challenge in natural language processing (NLP) research. Many existing methods extract word embeddings from an LLM, visualise the embedding space via point-plots, and compare the relative positions of certain words. However, this approach only considers single words and not whole natural language expressions, thus disregards the context in which a word is used. Here we present a novel tool for analysing and visualising information flow in natural language expressions by applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to word embeddings. We find that DTI reveals how information flows between word embeddings. Tracking information flows within the layers of an LLM allows for comparing different model structures and revealing opportunities for pruning an LLM's under-utilised layers. Furthermore, our model reveals differences in information flows for tasks like pronoun resolution and metaphor detection. Our results show that our model permits novel insights into how LLMs represent actual natural language expressions, extending the comparison of isolated word embeddings and improving the interpretability of NLP models.

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的说服性语言受接收者性别等因素影响，存在性别偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for everyday communication tasks, including drafting interpersonal messages intended to influence and persuade. Prior work has shown that LLMs can successfully persuade humans and amplify persuasive language. It is therefore essential to understand how user instructions affect the generation of persuasive language, and to understand whether the generated persuasive language differs, for example, when targeting different groups. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating how persuasive language generation is affected by recipient gender, sender intent, or output language. We evaluate 13 LLMs and 16 languages using pairwise prompt instructions. We evaluate model responses on 19 categories of persuasive language using an LLM-as-judge setup grounded in social psychology and communication science. Our results reveal significant gender differences in the persuasive language generated across all models. These patterns reflect biases consistent with gender-stereotypical linguistic tendencies documented in social psychology and sociolinguistics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to be trained to act as agents in various real-world environments, but this process relies on rich and varied tool-interaction sandboxes. However, access to real systems is often restricted; LLM-simulated environments are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies; and manually built sandboxes are hard to scale. In this paper, we propose EnvScaler, an automated framework for scalable tool-interaction environments via programmatic synthesis. EnvScaler comprises two components. First, SkelBuilder constructs diverse environment skeletons through topic mining, logic modeling, and quality evaluation. Then, ScenGenerator generates multiple task scenarios and rule-based trajectory validation functions for each environment. With EnvScaler, we synthesize 191 environments and about 7K scenarios, and apply them to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Qwen3 series models. Results on three benchmarks show that EnvScaler significantly improves LLMs' ability to solve tasks in complex environments involving multi-turn, multi-tool interactions. We release our code and data at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/EnvScaler.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance in zero-shot multilingual machine translation (MT). Some follow-up works further improved MT performance via preference optimization, but they leave a key aspect largely underexplored: the order in which data samples are given during training. We address this topic by integrating curriculum learning into various state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms to boost MT performance. We introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy with restarts (CLewR), which reiterates easy-to-hard curriculum multiple times during training to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of easy examples. We demonstrate consistent gains across several model families (Gemma2, Qwen2.5, Llama3.1) and preference optimization techniques. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/alexandra-dragomir/CLewR.

Abstract: Preference tuning aligns pretrained language models to human judgments of quality, helpfulness, or safety by optimizing over explicit preference signals rather than likelihood alone. Prior work has shown that preference-tuning degrades performance and reduces helpfulness when evaluated outside the training domain. However, the extent to which adaptation strategies mitigate this domain shift remains unexplored. We address this challenge by conducting a comprehensive and systematic study of alignment generalization under domain shift. We compare five popular alignment objectives and various adaptation strategies from source to target, including target-domain supervised fine-tuning and pseudo-labeling, across summarization and question-answering helpfulness tasks. Our findings reveal systematic differences in generalization across alignment objectives under domain shift. We show that adaptation strategies based on pseudo-labeling can substantially reduce domain-shift degradation

Motivation: 大语言模型在现实部署中仅保证正确性不够，需在上下文扰动下保持真实信念，现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: 提出Neighbor - Consistency Belief (NCB)衡量信念鲁棒性，引入新的认知压力测试协议，提出Structure - Aware Training (SAT)优化上下文不变信念结构。

Result: 跨多个大语言模型的实验表明，高NCB数据的性能相对更抗干扰，SAT可减少约30%的长尾知识脆弱性。

Conclusion: NCB能有效衡量大语言模型信念鲁棒性，SAT可优化模型上下文不变信念结构，减少长尾知识脆弱性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world settings, correctness alone is insufficient. Reliable deployment requires maintaining truthful beliefs under contextual perturbations. Existing evaluations largely rely on point-wise confidence like Self-Consistency, which can mask brittle belief. We show that even facts answered with perfect self-consistency can rapidly collapse under mild contextual interference. To address this gap, we propose Neighbor-Consistency Belief (NCB), a structural measure of belief robustness that evaluates response coherence across a conceptual neighborhood. To validate the efficiency of NCB, we introduce a new cognitive stress-testing protocol that probes outputs stability under contextual interference. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that the performance of high-NCB data is relatively more resistant to interference. Finally, we present Structure-Aware Training (SAT), which optimizes context-invariant belief structure and reduces long-tail knowledge brittleness by approximately 30%.

Motivation: 现有自主机器学习代理受Generate - Execute - Feedback范式限制，存在执行瓶颈，需绕过物理约束。

Method: 内化执行先验，用预测推理替代昂贵运行时检查；构建18438个成对比较的语料库；利用验证数据分析报告激发LLMs预测能力；采用Predict - then - Verify循环。

Result: LLMs在验证数据分析报告下预测准确率达61.5%，信心校准良好；FOREAGENT框架收敛加速6倍，性能超基于执行的基线6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，能加速自主机器学习代理的收敛速度并提升性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Autonomous machine learning agents have revolutionized scientific discovery, yet they remain constrained by a Generate-Execute-Feedback paradigm. Previous approaches suffer from a severe Execution Bottleneck, as hypothesis evaluation relies strictly on expensive physical execution. To bypass these physical constraints, we internalize execution priors to substitute costly runtime checks with instantaneous predictive reasoning, drawing inspiration from World Models. In this work, we formalize the task of Data-centric Solution Preference and construct a comprehensive corpus of 18,438 pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant predictive capabilities when primed with a Verified Data Analysis Report, achieving 61.5% accuracy and robust confidence calibration. Finally, we instantiate this framework in FOREAGENT, an agent that employs a Predict-then-Verify loop, achieving a 6x acceleration in convergence while surpassing execution-based baselines by +6%. Our code and dataset will be publicly available soon at https://github.com/zjunlp/predict-before-execute.

TL;DR: 本文提出多模态自动补全任务MAC，创建基准数据集，评估模型，提出Router - Suggest框架，研究发现多模态上下文对自动补全很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时多模态自动补全在依赖共享视觉上下文的场景中很关键，传统文本自动补全有局限，需引入多模态自动补全。

Method: 对MMDialog和ImageChat进行调整创建基准数据集，评估视觉语言模型和文本基线模型，提出Router - Suggest框架。

Result: Router - Suggest比最佳VLM速度提升2.3 - 10倍，用户研究显示VLM在用户满意度上显著优于文本模型。

Conclusion: 自动补全需要多模态上下文以打造更智能、更懂用户的助手。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal auto-completion is essential for digital assistants, chatbots, design tools, and healthcare consultations, where user inputs rely on shared visual context. We introduce Multimodal Auto-Completion (MAC), a task that predicts upcoming characters in live chats using partially typed text and visual cues. Unlike traditional text-only auto-completion (TAC), MAC grounds predictions in multimodal context to better capture user intent. To enable this task, we adapt MMDialog and ImageChat to create benchmark datasets. We evaluate leading vision-language models (VLMs) against strong textual baselines, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy and efficiency. We present Router-Suggest, a router framework that dynamically selects between textual models and VLMs based on dialog context, along with a lightweight variant for resource-constrained environments. Router-Suggest achieves a 2.3x to 10x speedup over the best-performing VLM. A user study shows that VLMs significantly excel over textual models on user satisfaction, notably saving user typing effort and improving the quality of completions in multi-turn conversations. These findings underscore the need for multimodal context in auto-completions, leading to smarter, user-aware assistants.

Abstract: Modelling a language model for a multi-lingual scenario includes several potential challenges, among which catastrophic forgetting is the major challenge. For example, small language models (SLM) built for low-resource languages by adapting large language models (LLMs) pose the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. This work proposes to employ a continual learning strategy using parts-of-speech (POS)-based code-switching along with a replay adapter strategy to mitigate the identified gap of catastrophic forgetting while training SLM from LLM. Experiments conducted on vision language tasks such as visual question answering and language modelling task exhibits the success of the proposed architecture.

Conclusion: 研究强调外行人依赖大语言模型获取法律指导的风险，以及在敏感法律背景下更有力评估模型行为的必要性，提供探索性和描述性证据以识别系统不对称性。

Abstract: Access to justice remains limited for many people, leading laypersons to increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal self-help. Laypeople use these tools intuitively, which may lead them to form expectations based on incomplete, incorrect, or biased outputs. This study examines whether leading LLMs exhibit gender bias in their responses to a realistic family law scenario. We present an expert-designed divorce scenario grounded in Czech family law and evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-5 nano, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 3.3 in a fully zero-shot interaction. We deploy two versions of the scenario, one with gendered names and one with neutral labels, to establish a baseline for comparison. We further introduce nine legally relevant factors that vary the factual circumstances of the case and test whether these variations influence the models' proposed shared-parenting ratios. Our preliminary results highlight differences across models and suggest gender-dependent patterns in the outcomes generated by some systems. The findings underscore both the risks associated with laypeople's reliance on LLMs for legal guidance and the need for more robust evaluation of model behavior in sensitive legal contexts. We present exploratory and descriptive evidence intended to identify systematic asymmetries rather than to establish causal effects.

Conclusion: Mole - Syn方法能有效引导合成有效长思维链结构，提升大语言模型长思维链推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型集成方法存在固定融合粒度的局限性，缺乏灵活性，无法适应不同任务的生成特征。

Method: 提出AdaFuse框架，引入基于不确定性的标准决定是否进行集成，在不确定状态下采用多样性感知的缩放策略。

Result: 在开放域问答、算术推理和机器翻译实验中，AdaFuse始终优于强集成基线，平均相对提升6.88%。

Conclusion: AdaFuse能有效解决现有集成方法的局限性，提升大语言模型集成效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility required for mid-generation adaptation and fails to adapt to different generation characteristics across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AdaFuse, an adaptive ensemble decoding framework that dynamically selects semantically appropriate fusion units during generation. Rather than committing to a fixed granularity, AdaFuse adjusts fusion behavior on the fly based on the decoding context, with words serving as basic building blocks for alignment. To be specific, we introduce an uncertainty-based criterion to decide whether to apply ensembling at each decoding step. Under confident decoding states, the model continues generation directly. In less certain states, AdaFuse invokes a diversity-aware scaling strategy to explore alternative candidate continuations and inform ensemble decisions. This design establishes a synergistic interaction between adaptive ensembling and test-time scaling, where ensemble decisions guide targeted exploration, and the resulting diversity in turn strengthens ensemble quality. Experiments on open-domain question answering, arithmetic reasoning, and machine translation demonstrate that AdaFuse consistently outperforms strong ensemble baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 6.88%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学分转移中课程衔接人工审核耗时长、资源多，现有AI应用有限，需可扩展支持。

Method: 先调查工作人员和教师对算法推荐的接受率及反馈，再开发监督对齐方法解决描述匹配和机构偏差问题。

Result: 新方法准确率比之前提高5.5倍，基于预测和61%的接受率，预计有效学分流动机会增加12倍。

Conclusion: 利益相关者参与设计高等教育管理中的AI可扩大学生学分流动，重塑课程衔接决策。

Abstract: Transferring from a 2-year to a 4-year college is crucial for socioeconomic mobility, yet students often face challenges ensuring their credits are fully recognized, leading to delays in their academic progress and unexpected costs. Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized. This study suggests that stakeholder-informed design of AI in higher education administration can expand student credit mobility and help reshape current institutional decision-making in course articulation.

Conclusion: SAFE是首个不使用目标对象校准数据，同时实现高解码准确性、强对抗鲁棒性和可靠隐私保护的算法，适用于现实脑机接口。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.

Abstract: Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.

Conclusion: 所提有限混合回归模型适用于圆形响应变量，解决了多峰问题，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Regression models, where the response variable is circular, are common in areas such as biology, geology and meteorology. A typical model assumes that the conditional distribution of the response follows a von-Mises distribution. However, this assumption is inadequate when the response variable is multimodal. For this reason, in this paper, a finite mixture of regressions model is proposed for the case of a circular response variable and a set of circular and/or linear covariates. Mixture models are very useful when the underlying population is multimodal. Despite the prevalence of multimodality in regression modelling of circular data, the use of mixtures of regressions has received no attention in the literature. This paper aims to close this knowledge gap. To estimate the proposed model, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. An extensive simulation study is used to demonstrate the practical use and performance of the proposed model and estimation procedure. In addition, the model is shown to be useful as a model-based clustering tool. Lastly, the model is applied to a real dataset from a wind farm in South Africa.

Conclusion: MGQDA对高维多组分类问题有实际价值。

Abstract: Multi-group classification arises in many prediction and decision-making problems, including applications in epidemiology, genomics, finance, and image recognition. Although classification methods have advanced considerably, much of the literature focuses on binary problems, and available extensions often provide limited flexibility for multi-group settings. Recent work has extended linear discriminant analysis to multiple groups, but more general methods are still needed to handle complex structures such as nonlinear decision boundaries and group-specific covariance patterns.
  We develop Multi-Group Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (MGQDA), a method for multi-group classification built on quadratic discriminant analysis. MGQDA projects high-dimensional predictors onto a lower-dimensional subspace, which enables accurate classification while capturing nonlinearity and heterogeneity in group-specific covariance structures. We derive theoretical guarantees, including variable selection consistency, to support the reliability of the procedure. In simulations and a gene-expression application, MGQDA achieves competitive or improved predictive performance compared with existing methods while selecting group-specific informative variables, indicating its practical value for high-dimensional multi-group classification problems. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

Conclusion: 原型型分析可應用於名義觀測，能增進對名義數據集的理解。

Abstract: Archetypal analysis serves as an exploratory tool that interprets a collection of observations as convex combinations of pure (extreme) patterns. When these patterns correspond to actual observations within the sample, they are termed archetypoids. For the first time, we propose applying archetypoid analysis to nominal observations, specifically for identifying archetypal cases from questionnaires featuring nominal multiple-choice questions with a single possible answer. This approach can enhance our understanding of a nominal data set, similar to its application in multivariate contexts. We compare this methodology with the use of archetype analysis and probabilistic archetypal analysis and demonstrate the benefits of this methodology using a real-world example: the German credit dataset.

Abstract: Traditional methods for determining critical parameters are often influenced by human factors. This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery.

Abstract: The use of neural networks in edge devices is increasing, which introduces new security challenges related to the neural networks' confidentiality. As edge devices often offer physical access, attacks targeting the hardware, such as side-channel analysis, must be considered. To enhance the performance of neural network inference, hardware accelerators are commonly employed. This work investigates the influence of parallel processing within such accelerators on correlation-based side-channel attacks that exploit power consumption. The focus is on neurons that are part of the same fully-connected layer, which run parallel and simultaneously process the same input value. The theoretical impact of concurrent multiply-and-accumulate operations on overall power consumption is evaluated, as well as the success rate of correlation power analysis. Based on the observed behavior, equations are derived that describe how the correlation decreases with increasing levels of parallelism. The applicability of these equations is validated using a vector-multiplication unit implemented on an FPGA.

Abstract: Agentic AI marks an important transition from single-step generative models to systems capable of reasoning, planning, acting, and adapting over long-lasting tasks. By integrating memory, tool use, and iterative decision cycles, these systems enable continuous, autonomous workflows in real-world environments. This survey examines the implications of agentic AI for cybersecurity. On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale. Conversely, the same properties amplify adversarial power by accelerating reconnaissance, exploitation, coordination, and social-engineering attacks. These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems. To address these challenges, we survey emerging threat models, security frameworks, and evaluation pipelines tailored to agentic systems, and analyze systemic risks including agent collusion, cascading failures, oversight evasion, and memory poisoning. Finally, we present three representative use-case implementations that illustrate how agentic AI behaves in practical cybersecurity workflows, and how design choices shape reliability, safety, and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: In recent years, the security vulnerabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a serious concern in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) research. These highly intelligent models, capable of performing multi-modal tasks with high accuracy, are also severely susceptible to carefully launched security attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, which can manipulate model behavior and bypass safety constraints. This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.

Result: 在常用模型上实验表明iMIST攻击有效性高，拒绝率低。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型安全机制存在关键漏洞，急需更强大的防御策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, however, they remain critically vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses violating human values and safety guidelines. Despite extensive research on defense mechanisms, existing safeguards prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial strategies. In this work, we propose iMIST (\underline{i}nteractive \underline{M}ulti-step \underline{P}rogre\underline{s}sive \underline{T}ool-disguised Jailbreak Attack), a novel adaptive jailbreak method that synergistically exploits vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. iMIST disguises malicious queries as normal tool invocations to bypass content filters, while simultaneously introducing an interactive progressive optimization algorithm that dynamically escalates response harmfulness through multi-turn dialogues guided by real-time harmfulness assessment. Our experiments on widely-used models demonstrate that iMIST achieves higher attack effectiveness, while maintaining low rejection rates. These results reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型多轮越狱攻击有缺陷，本文提出Mastermind框架，实验证明其优于现有方法，且抗防御能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱攻击存在难以保持长交互连贯性、依赖固定模式、无法适应模型动态对话状态等问题。

Method: 引入采用动态和自我改进方法的Mastermind框架，通过规划、执行和反思的闭环操作，利用分层规划架构，由知识仓库指导规划，动态组合和调整攻击向量。

Result: 在对抗GPT - 5和Claude 3.7 Sonnet等模型的实验中，Mastermind攻击成功率和有害性评分高于现有基线，对多种先进防御机制有抵抗能力。

Conclusion: Mastermind能有效解决现有多轮越狱攻击的不足，提升攻击效果和抗防御能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant threat from multi-turn jailbreak attacks, where adversaries progressively steer conversations to elicit harmful outputs. However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms.

Method: 提出HogVul框架，采用粒子群优化驱动的统一双通道优化策略，协调词法和语法两级扰动。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实验，HogVul攻击成功率比现有基线方法平均提升26.05%。

Conclusion: 混合优化策略在暴露模型漏洞方面有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in software vulnerability detection have been driven by Language Model (LM)-based approaches. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但展示攻击性能意味着该攻击方法在多轮攻击领域有一定有效性。

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new generation of powerful chatbots that can be developed at relatively low cost. As companies deploy these tools, security challenges need to be addressed to prevent financial loss and reputational damage. A key security challenge is jailbreaking, the malicious manipulation of prompts and inputs to bypass a chatbot's safety guardrails. Multi-turn attacks are a relatively new form of jailbreaking involving a carefully crafted chain of interactions with a chatbot. We introduce Echo Chamber, a new multi-turn attack using a gradual escalation method. We describe this attack in detail, compare it to other multi-turn attacks, and demonstrate its performance against multiple state-of-the-art models through extensive evaluation.

Method: 提出VIGIL框架，采用验证后提交协议，促进推测性假设生成并通过基于意图的验证确保安全；引入SIREN基准模拟威胁。

Result: 广泛实验表明，VIGIL比最先进的动态防御降低超22%的攻击成功率，相比静态基线使受攻击时的实用性翻倍。

Conclusion: VIGIL实现了安全和实用性的最佳平衡。

Abstract: LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.

Motivation: 现有基于随机游走和GNN的网络异常检测方法存在无法整合丰富边缘数据、训练需大量内存的问题。

Method: 将随机游走的skip - gram思路扩展到基于transformer的基础模型，训练图基础模型预测随机游走中缺失的标记，微调后用于链接预测和异常检测。

Result: CyberGFM在三个常用网络异常检测数据集上取得最优结果，平均精度提升达2倍。

Conclusion: CyberGFM在无监督链接预测的网络异常检测中表现优于所有先前工作，参数数量相同，效率相当或更好。

Abstract: Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.

Conclusion: 现代大语言模型代理使重新识别攻击变得容易且低成本，现有防护措施可被绕过，需采取缓解措施并解决相关开放问题。

Abstract: On December 4, 2025, Anthropic released Anthropic Interviewer, an AI tool for running qualitative interviews at scale, along with a public dataset of 1,250 interviews with professionals, including 125 scientists, about their use of AI for research. Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks. I outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems. I have notified Anthropic of my findings.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及结论。

Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.

Motivation: 现有光学动作捕捉系统成本高、需大量手动后处理，低成本视觉方法在遮挡下精度和可靠性低，难以捕捉细粒度手物交互。

Method: 使用密集的字符编码标记贴片在严重自遮挡下实现鲁棒跟踪，构建自动化重建流程，减少手动操作。

Result: 创建了涵盖多样化操作行为和物体的细粒度手物交互数据集DexterHand。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码以支持灵巧手物交互的未来研究。

Abstract: Capturing fine-grained hand-object interactions is challenging due to severe self-occlusion from closely spaced fingers and the subtlety of in-hand manipulation motions. Existing optical motion capture systems rely on expensive camera setups and extensive manual post-processing, while low-cost vision-based methods often suffer from reduced accuracy and reliability under occlusion. To address these challenges, we present DexterCap, a low-cost optical capture system for dexterous in-hand manipulation. DexterCap uses dense, character-coded marker patches to achieve robust tracking under severe self-occlusion, together with an automated reconstruction pipeline that requires minimal manual effort. With DexterCap, we introduce DexterHand, a dataset of fine-grained hand-object interactions covering diverse manipulation behaviors and objects, from simple primitives to complex articulated objects such as a Rubik's Cube. We release the dataset and code to support future research on dexterous hand-object interaction.

Conclusion: PRISM是实用的端到端工作流，连接语言协议生成、模拟验证和自动化机器人执行。

Abstract: Automating experimental protocol design and execution remains as a fundamental bottleneck in realizing self-driving laboratories. We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The high-dimensional complex nature of detectors makes fast calorimeter simulations a prime application for modern generative machine learning. Vision transformers (ViTs) can emulate the Geant4 response with unmatched accuracy and are not limited to regular geometries. Starting from the CaloDREAM architecture, we demonstrate the robustness and scalability of ViTs on regular and irregular geometries, and multiple detectors. Our results show that ViTs generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers statistically indistinguishable from Geant4 in multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the generation time in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ ms on a single GPU. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on a large dataset and fine-tuning on the target geometry leads to reduced training costs and higher data efficiency, or altogether improves the fidelity of generated showers.

Conclusion: 需要一系列实证、技术和理论进步，才能充分实现人工智能介导审议在增强公民参与和加强民主审议方面的前景。

Abstract: The strength of democracy lies in the free and equal exchange of diverse viewpoints. Living up to this ideal at scale faces inherent tensions: broad participation, meaningful deliberation, and political equality often trade off with one another (Fishkin, 2011). We ask whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) could help navigate this "trilemma" by engaging with a recent example of a large language model (LLM)-based system designed to help people with diverse viewpoints find common ground (Tessler, Bakker, et al., 2024). Here, we explore the implications of the introduction of LLMs into deliberation augmentation tools, examining their potential to enhance participation through scalability, improve political equality via fair mediation, and foster meaningful deliberation by, for example, surfacing trustworthy information. We also point to key challenges that remain. Ultimately, a range of empirical, technical, and theoretical advancements are needed to fully realize the promise of AI-mediated deliberation for enhancing citizen engagement and strengthening democratic deliberation.

Motivation: 传统SpO2估计方法依赖复杂临床校准，不适用于低功耗可穿戴应用。

Method: 先在公共临床数据集上预训练带自注意力的双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）模型，再用可穿戴设备和FDA批准的参考脉搏血氧仪收集的数据微调。

Result: 在公共数据集上平均绝对误差（MAE）为2.967%，私有数据集为2.624%，优于传统校准和非迁移机器学习基线；25Hz PPG比100Hz降低40%功耗；瞬时SpO2预测MAE为3.284%。

Conclusion: 该方法能在可穿戴设备上实现准确、低功耗的SpO2监测快速适配，无需临床校准。

Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a vital marker for healthcare monitoring. Traditional SpO2 estimation methods often rely on complex clinical calibration, making them unsuitable for low-power, wearable applications. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based framework for the rapid adaptation of SpO2 estimation to energy-efficient wearable devices using low-sampling-rate (25Hz) dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG). We first pretrain a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model with self-attention on a public clinical dataset, then fine-tune it using data collected from our wearable We-Be band and an FDA-approved reference pulse oximeter. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.967% on the public dataset and 2.624% on the private dataset, significantly outperforming traditional calibration and non-transferred machine learning baselines. Moreover, using 25Hz PPG reduces power consumption by 40% compared to 100Hz, excluding baseline draw. Our method also attains an MAE of 3.284% in instantaneous SpO2 prediction, effectively capturing rapid fluctuations. These results demonstrate the rapid adaptation of accurate, low-power SpO2 monitoring on wearable devices without the need for clinical calibration.

Conclusion: 多波长PPG中的互补信息和课程对抗策略在准确和稳健的血压估计方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable blood pressure (BP) estimation is vital for the early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we enforce subject-level data splitting on a public multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) dataset and propose a generalizable BP estimation framework based on curriculum-adversarial learning. Our approach combines curriculum learning, which transitions from hypertension classification to BP regression, with domain-adversarial training that confuses subject identity to encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Experiments show that multi-channel fusion consistently outperforms single-channel models. On the four-wavelength PPG dataset, our method achieves strong performance under strict subject-level splitting, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 14.2mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.4mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the curriculum and adversarial components. These results highlight the potential of leveraging complementary information in multi-wavelength PPG and curriculum-adversarial strategies for accurate and robust BP estimation.

Abstract: The early detection of Parkinsons disease remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroscience, with electroencephalography offering a noninvasive and scalable pathway toward population level screening. While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains.

TL;DR: 提出多任务学习框架微调BiomedCLIP以改进CXR图像文本检索，结果优于预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP和BiomedCLIP未针对细粒度医学检索任务优化，需改进CXR图像文本检索。

Method: 以BiomedCLIP为骨干，用多任务复合损失函数训练轻量级MLP投影头。

Result: 微调模型在图像到文本和文本到图像检索任务上表现更优，t - SNE可视化显示语义聚类更清晰。

Conclusion: 领域自适应多任务学习对推进生物医学跨模态检索有价值。

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 引入双正交因子分解（BFD）框架分析视觉Transformer的注意力机制，发现注意力主要通过内容运作、机制有专业化现象及DINOv2在形状处理上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对视觉Transformer中注意力机制在token间交换信息的原则性理解，传统注意力图无法揭示信息交换类型。

Method: 提出分两阶段的双正交因子分解（BFD）框架，先用基于ANOVA的分解将token激活分解为位置和内容因子，再用SVD分析查询 - 键交互矩阵。

Result: （i）注意力主要通过内容运作，Content - content交互占主导，DINOv2在内容 - 位置分配更多能量。（ii）注意力机制有专业化现象，头部有不同分工，内部奇异模式也类似。（iii）DINOv2的中间层能同时保留位置结构和丰富语义内容，有利于整体形状处理。

Conclusion: BFD揭示了token通过注意力的交互方式和信息中介因素，为理解视觉Transformer机制提供实用见解。

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

Conclusion: 所提方法在图像地理定位任务上有显著优势，使用地图的策略能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

Conclusion: 基于SAM的表征与分割引导学习相结合，显著提高乳腺超声影像的病变勾勒和诊断预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VIB - Probe显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: VIB - Probe在视觉语言模型幻觉检测和缓解方面表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 提出的半监督面部表情识别算法有效。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: GS - DMSR方法能有效解决3D动态场景重建中模型收敛率和渲染质量平衡问题。

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Result: 该方法在形状主导数据集上持续提高分类准确率，尤其在低数据情况下仅训练最终分类层即可。

Conclusion: 所提指标和适应方法能有效解决CNN在形状主导数据集上的性能问题。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to exhibit a strong texture bias, favoring local patterns over global shape information--a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境具有实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

Conclusion: ViTNT - FIQA计算高效，可直接应用于任何基于预训练ViT的人脸识别模型。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Abstract: Estimating the size of hidden populations using Multiple Systems Estimation (MSE) is a critical task in quantitative sociology; however, practical application is often hindered by imperfect administrative data and computational constraints. Real-world datasets frequently suffer from censoring and missingness due to privacy concerns, while standard inference methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can become computationally intractable or fail to converge when data are sparse. To address these limitations, we propose a novel simulation-based Bayesian inference framework utilizing Neural Bayes Estimators (NBE) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPE). These neural methods are amortized: once trained, they provide instantaneous, computationally efficient posterior estimates, making them ideal for use in secure research environments where computational resources are limited. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that neural estimators achieve accuracy comparable to MCMC while being orders of magnitude faster and robust to the convergence failures that plague traditional samplers in sparse settings. We demonstrate our method on two real-world cases estimating the prevalence of modern slavery in the UK and female drug use in North East England.
