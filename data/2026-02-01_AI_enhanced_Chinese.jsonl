However, real-world network data often suffer from noise, biases, and missing data in the edge weights, which undermine the reliability of downstream network analyses. Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network topology and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u7ef4\u7eb3\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u96c6\u4f53\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u7ef4\u7eb3\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u4f53\u8fb9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7f3a\u5931\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9175\u6bcd\u57fa\u56e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b89\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ef4\u7eb3\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5021\u5bfc\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns.

We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSENDAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4ece\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u536b\u661f\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSENDAI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6821\u6b63\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u9065\u611f\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u5206\u5e03\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0cSENDAI\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u573a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u5927SSIM\u6539\u5584\u8fbe185%\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u670936%\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "SENDAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed.

Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that A2RAG achieves +9.9/+11.8 absolute gains in Recall@2, while cutting token consumption and end-to-end latency by about 50% relative to iterative multihop baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faA2RAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3Graph - RAG\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "Graph - RAG\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u635f\u5931\u4e24\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faA2RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u5e76\u6309\u9700\u89e6\u53d1\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u68c0\u7d22\u529b\u5ea6\u5e76\u5c06\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728HotpotQA\u548c2WikiMultiHopQA\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cA2RAG\u5728Recall@2\u4e0a\u6709+9.9/+11.8\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "A2RAG\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u591a\u8df3\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6545\u969cEJ\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u8def\u7531\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cEJ\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d2a\u5a6a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7684Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRL\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8d2a\u5a6a\u8def\u7531\u57289\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u6700\u4f18\u4e3a52 - 54%\uff0cRL\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u8fbe\u602794%\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5305\u4ea4\u4ed8\u738791%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8d8590%\uff0c\u62e5\u585e\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8eDijkstra\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

By enabling direct editing, natural-language profiles allow users to explicitly articulate preferences that may be difficult to infer from past behavior.

While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness.

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM.

Our approach integrates a differentiable Soft-DTW alignment loss to maintain spike timing fidelity and employs a temporal expansion and contraction mechanism on output logits to enforce robust representation learning. Implemented on a deep ResNet19 spiking backbone, STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10. Empirical results demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms strong ANN baselines (ER, DER++) while preserving biologically plausible dynamics.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability.

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations.\n  To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops.\n  The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data.

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LHD\u6846\u67b6\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDASH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LHD\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u7aef\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u7565\u6536\u655b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynamics - Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u655b\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR)\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDASH\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d853\u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8590%\u7684LLM\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "DASH\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LHD\u6846\u67b6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.\n  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\\sim5\\%$ of block payload).

The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework.

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2.

While educational attainment is consistently linked to better physical health, its mental health effects - particularly for women - remain underexplored, and causal evidence is limited. We estimate the impact of college completion on depression among middle-aged women in South Korea, leveraging the 1993 higher education reform, which raised women's college attainment by 45 percentage points (pp) over the following decade. We use two nationally representative datasets to triangulate evidence, including the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2007-2021) for physician-diagnosed depression, and the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Families (KLoWF, 2007-2022) to validate findings using self-reports of depressive symptoms. We implement two-stage least squares (2SLS) with a birth-cohort instrument based on exposure to the reform (within 3 years of the cutoff in KNHANES and within 1 to 3 years in KLoWF). In KNHANES, college completion lowers physician-diagnosed depression by 2.4 pp, attenuating to 1.6 pp after adjusting for income, employment, and physical health. In KLoWF, college completion improves self-reported mental health. The weekly depressive-symptoms composite declines by 17.4 pp, attenuating to 16.4 pp after covariate adjustment. Placebo tests on unaffected cohorts yield null results. This study contributes to the growing quasi-experimental literature on education and mental health with convergent evidence across clinical diagnoses and self-reported depressive symptoms in South Korea. By focusing on college education in a non-Western setting, it extends the external validity of existing findings and highlights educational policy as a potential lever to reduce the burden of midlife depression among women.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u97e9\u56fd1993\u5e74\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u5b66\u6bd5\u4e1a\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5e74\u5973\u6027\u6291\u90c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u5b66\u6bd5\u4e1a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6291\u90c1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u51cf\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u5e74\u6291\u90c1\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u53d7\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6559\u80b2\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u5b66\u6bd5\u4e1a\u5bf9\u97e9\u56fd\u4e2d\u5e74\u5973\u6027\u6291\u90c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75281993\u5e74\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5168\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff082SLS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u9769\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u51fa\u751f\u961f\u5217\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728KNHANES\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5b66\u6bd5\u4e1a\u964d\u4f4e\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u7387\uff1b\u5728KLoWF\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5b66\u6bd5\u4e1a\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u672a\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u961f\u5217\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u5e74\u6291\u90c1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013.

It remains consistent under a comparatively weak dependence condition in which conventional OLS- and GLS-based estimators can be inconsistent, and it is asymptotically efficient under stronger conditions.

To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization.

In this work, we analyze various methods of forming an alliance in the Coalitional General Lotto game, a simple model of competitive resource allocation. In the game, Players 1 and 2 independently compete against a common Adversary by allocating their limited resource budgets towards separate sets of contests; an agent wins a contest by allocating more resources towards it than their opponent. In this setting, we study three alliance mechanisms: budget transfers (resource donation), contest transfers (contest redistribution), and joint transfers (both simultaneously). For all three mechanisms, we study when they present opportunities for collective improvement (the sum of the Players' payoffs increases) or mutual improvement (both Players' individual payoffs increase). In our first result, we show that all three are fundamentally different with regards to mutual improvement; in particular, mutually beneficial budget and contest transfers exist in distinct, limited subsets of games, whereas mutually beneficial joint transfers exist in almost all games. However, in our second result, we demonstrate that all three mechanisms are equivalent when it comes to collective improvement; that is, collectively beneficial budget, contest, and joint transfers exist in almost all game instances, and all three mechanisms achieve the same maximum collective payoff.

In this model, an adversary gives an enumeration of example strings from an unknown target language, and the algorithm is tasked with correctly generating unseen strings from the target language within finite time. Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026).

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

Using daily polling data on Donald Trump and measures such as the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index, the 5-year Breakeven Inflation Rate, the Trade Policy Uncertainty index, and the VIX, we estimate conditional correlation models to capture time-varying interactions. The analysis reveals that in 2020, correlations between polls and uncertainty measures were highly dynamic and event-driven, reflecting the influence of exogenous shocks (COVID-19, oil price collapse) and political milestones (primaries, debates). In contrast, during the 2024 campaign, correlations remained close to zero, stable, and largely unresponsive to shocks, suggesting that entrenched polarization and non-economic events (e.g., assassination attempt, candidate changes) muted the economic channel. The study highlights how the interplay between voter sentiment, financial markets, and uncertainty varies across electoral contexts, offering a methodological contribution through the application of Dynamic Conditional Correlation models to political data and policy-relevant insights on the conditions under which economic fundamentals influence electoral dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd2020\u548c2024\u5e74\u603b\u7edf\u9009\u4e3e\u671f\u95f4\u6c11\u610f\u8c03\u67e5\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u9009\u4e3e\u5e74\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9009\u4e3e\u6c11\u610f\u8c03\u67e5\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u91d1\u878d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u65e5\u6c11\u610f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u53d8\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "2020\u5e74\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u53d7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c2024\u5e74\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u65e0\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u6c11\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u56e0\u9009\u4e3e\u80cc\u666f\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u4e3e\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\\approx 0.73$ vs.\\ $\\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants.

While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling.

Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\\% in communication overhead and 40\\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSA - PSKY\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6982\u7387\u5929\u9645\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u5929\u9645\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u6216\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08DDPG\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "SA - PSKY\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0a\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e60%\uff0c\u603b\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e40%\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SA - PSKY\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6982\u7387\u5929\u9645\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder.

However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute.

This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject.

Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRLME\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u80fd\u62d3\u5bbd\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RLME\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5143\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5f97\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u505a\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "RLME\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "RLME\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

A Critical Analysis of Systematic Literature Reviews on Agile Effort and Cost Estimation", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u654f\u6377\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5206\u679018\u7bc7SLR\u627e\u5e38\u89c1\u7406\u7531\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2dSLR\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u672a\u5145\u5206\u68c0\u67e5\u5df2\u6709SLR\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u65bdSLR\u5f88\u8017\u8d39\u7cbe\u529b\uff0c\u6b64\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u6545\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u5c55\u989d\u5916SLR\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u6377\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e00\u72ed\u7a84\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u5145\u5206\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5bf918\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684SLR\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5f15\u7528\u6570\u636e\u3001\u51fa\u7248\u5e74\u4efd\u3001\u51fa\u7248\u573a\u6240\u548cSLR\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7406\u7531\u6a21\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u4f5c\u8005\u58f0\u79f0\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u5148\u524dSLR\u8fc7\u65f6\u3001\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u6b65\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u7efc\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u72ed\u7a84\u4e3b\u9898\u7684SLR\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684SLR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709SLR\u548c\u5f00\u5c55\u65b0SLR\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7cbe\u529b\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free.

This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions.

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost.

However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting.

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f53\u80b2\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51faVERSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51faK\u8054\u8d5b1\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVERSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u51faK\u8054\u8d5b1 2024\u8d5b\u5b6318.81%\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0cVERSA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38VAEP\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce such an approach, leveraging gamified incentives and a model for user's acceptance on incentives, thus encouraging energy-efficient behaviors such as adaptive bitrate streaming. Each user is characterized by an environmental sensitivity factor and a private incentive threshold, shaping probabilistic responses to energy-saving offers. A serious-game mechanism based on positive behavioral reinforcement and rewards of the users, due to their inclusion in top-K and bottom-M rankings, fosters peer comparison and competition, thus transforming passive acceptance into active engagement. Moreover, within a Stackelberg game formulation, the video streaming service provider--acting as the strategic leader--optimizes both incentive levels and game parameters to achieve network-wide energy and traffic reductions, while adhering to budgetary constraints. This structured approach empowers providers with proactive, application-level control over energy consumption, offering them measurable benefits such as reduced high-bitrate traffic and increased participation in energy-saving behaviors, while also considering user satisfaction. The results of our simulations show that indeed gamification boosts significantly user participation and energy savings provided that the incentive and game parameters are chosen optimally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u9f13\u52b1\u8282\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ICT\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9700\u5f15\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e25\u8083\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u4f18\u5316\u6fc0\u52b1\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback.

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling.

Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision.

By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Efficient coordination between shelters and victims plays a crucial role in building community resilience, yet the evolution of two-layer behavioral feedback between these two groups through network coupling remains insufficiently understood. Here, this study develops a two-layer network to capture the cross-layer coupling between shelters and victims. The upper layer uses a post-disaster emergency resource redistribution model within the framework of the public goods game, while the lower layer adopts a cooperative evolutionary game to describe internal victim interactions. Monte Carlo simulations on scale-free networks reveal threshold effects of incentives: moderate public goods enhancement and subsidies promote cooperation, whereas excessive incentives induce free-riding. In contrast, credible and well-executed punishment effectively suppresses defection. Targeted punishment of highly connected shelters significantly enhances cooperation under resource constraints. A comparative analysis using a network generated from the actual coordinates of Beijing shelters confirms the model's generality and practical applicability. The findings highlight the importance of calibrated incentives, enforceable sanctions, and structural targeting in fostering robust cooperation across organizational and individual levels in post-disaster environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u707e\u540e\u907f\u96be\u6240\u4e0e\u53d7\u707e\u8005\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u53db\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u540e\u8d44\u6e90\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u762b\u75ea\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u51fa\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u96be\u6240\u548c\u53d7\u707e\u8005\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u793e\u533a\u6062\u590d\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c42\u7528\u707e\u540e\u5e94\u6025\u8d44\u6e90\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u7528\u5408\u4f5c\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d7\u707e\u8005\u5185\u90e8\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u9608\u503c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u6fc0\u52b1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u642d\u4fbf\u8f66\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u60e9\u7f5a\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u53db\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u9ad8\u8fde\u63a5\u907f\u96be\u6240\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u6fc0\u52b1\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u6548\u5236\u88c1\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u9776\u5411\u5bf9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c42\u9762\u5408\u4f5c\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Firstly, it mitigates cross-domain disparity transfer by adaptively integrating unlabeled data to equilibrate the informativeness of training signals across groups. Secondly, it redistributes cross-domain information gains via an information-theoretic approach to ensure equitable benefit allocation across groups. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and baselines demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces unfairness in CDR without sacrificing overall recommendation performance, while even enhancing it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4ea7\u751f\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCDFA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCDFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CDFA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics.

To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees.

In this problem, we are given a depot and a set of customers, each with a demand, embedded in a metric space. The objective is to find a set of tours, each starting and ending at the depot, operated by the capacititated vehicle at the depot to serve all customers, such that all customers are served, and the total travel cost is minimized. We consider the unplittable variant, where the demand of each customer must be served entirely by a single tour. Let $\u03b1$ denote the current best-known approximation ratio for the metric traveling salesman problem. The previous best approximation ratio was $\u03b1+1+\\ln 2+\u03b4<3.1932$ for a small constant $\u03b4>0$ (Friggstad et al., Math. Oper. Res. 2025), which can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023). In this paper, we propose two improved approximation algorithms. The first algorithm focuses on the case of fixed vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $\u03b1+1+\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y_0\\bigr)<3.0897$, where $y_0>0.39312$ is the unique root of $\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y\\bigr)=\\frac{3}{2}y$. The second algorithm considers general vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $\u03b1+1+y_1+\\ln\\left(2-2y_1\\right)+\u03b4<3.1759$ for a small constant $\u03b4>0$, where $y_1>0.17458$ is the unique root of $\\frac{1}{2} y_1+ 6 (1-y_1)\\bigl(1-e^{-\\frac{1}{2} y_1}\\bigr) =\\ln\\left(2-2y_1\\right)$.

In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models. LEMUR is an order of magnitude faster than earlier multi-vector similarity search methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6LEMUR\uff0c\u6bd4\u65e9\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u65f6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u5148\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528\u5355\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728ColBERTv2\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5747\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "LEMUR\u6bd4\u65e9\u671f\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002"}}

MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578bABOM\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MetaBBO\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u5de5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5143\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faABOM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "ABOM\u5728\u5408\u6210BBO\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u6709\u663e\u8457\u641c\u7d22\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ABOM\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709MetaBBO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions.

Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance.

Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability.

To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop.

Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation.

We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints.

ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u56e0GPU\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u96be\u6269\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faScaleSim\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe1.74\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ef4\u62a4\u79c1\u6709GPU\u9a7b\u7559\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u5f88\u5feb\u8017\u5c3d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8c03\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u7edf\u4e00\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51faScaleSim\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u9a71\u9010\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "ScaleSim\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6bd4SGLang\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.74\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ScaleSim\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $\u03b1$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods.

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

This research measures the efficacy of detectors in identifying LLM-paraphrased fake news, in particular, determining whether adding a paraphrase step in the detection pipeline helps or impedes detection. This study contributes: (1) Detectors struggle to detect LLM-paraphrased fake news more than human-written text, (2) We find which models excel at which tasks (evading detection, paraphrasing to evade detection, and paraphrasing for semantic similarity). (3) Via LIME explanations, we discovered a possible reason for detection failures: sentiment shift.

These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload.

LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the G\u00f6del t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy.

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff08ACQO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528RL\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACQO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff08AQR\uff09\u548c\u6392\u540d\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff08RSF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "ACQO\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQO\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u201c\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEaE\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u7528LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u5176\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201c\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u63d0\u53d6 - \u8bc4\u4f30\uff08EaE\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "EaE\u5728BigCodeBench - Sabotage\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u7834\u574f\u68c0\u6d4b\u738716.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u672a\u5bdf\u89c9\u88ab\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u8f83\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684Gemini\u548cClaude\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u636e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u60c5\u51b5\u5bf9LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff0cEaE\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study.

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains.

Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdStatsformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\u6216\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6821\u51c6\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f1a\u88ab\u81ea\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "Statsformer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u795e\u8c15\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u5e93\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u51f8\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.\n  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.\n  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51fa\u9662\u8ba1\u5212\u7684Planner - Auditor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u91cd\u653e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51fa\u9662\u8ba1\u5212\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC - IV - on - FHIR\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0cPlanner\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0cAuditor\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7b49\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u5c42\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f13\u5b58\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u589e\u76ca\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4ece32%\u63d0\u5347\u523086%\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "Planner - Auditor\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51fa\u9662\u8ba1\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale.

Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality.

This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u504f\u89c1\u6280\u5de7\u201d\u53ef\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5730\u7f29\u77ed\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6279\u5224\u68c0\u67e5\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u504f\u89c1\u6280\u5de7\u201d\uff08PT\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfcPT\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5404\u7c7b\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "PT\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7f29\u77ed\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u590d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u540c\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u533a\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0CP\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3cPT\u6280\u672f\u9690\u5f0f\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u6c60\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLandmark (LMK) \u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c60\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5982[CLS]\u96c6\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u7a00\u91ca\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Landmark (LMK) \u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u5757\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bf9\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5353\u5e94\u7528UI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCovAgent\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5e76\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5353\u5e94\u7528UI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCovAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u68c0\u67e5\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u6362\u56fe\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u811a\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8d85\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CovAgent\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5353\u5e94\u7528UI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\\times$ energy differences.

The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers.

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u751f\u6210\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u66ff\u4ee3\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u65e0\u63d0\u5347\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5219\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faBLEUpara\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u624b\u8bed\u8bed\u53e5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u5236\u7ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8en-gram\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u91ca\u4e49\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u91ca\u4e49\u5bf9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBLEUpara\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0cBLEUpara\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u91ca\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cBLEUpara\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u5e03\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u6e90\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times.

A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons.

We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper.

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models.

To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a systematic and structured review of trustworthy intelligent education. Specifically, We first organize intelligent education into five representative task categories: learner ability assessment, learning resource recommendation, learning analytics, educational content understanding, and instructional assistance. Building on this task landscape, we review existing studies from five trustworthiness perspectives, including safety and privacy, robustness, fairness, explainability, and sustainability, and summarize and categorize the research methodologies and solution strategies therein. Finally, we summarize key challenges and discuss future research directions.

These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8).

While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.\n  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08AAD\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLaMEA\u5f62\u6210LLaMEA - SAGE\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982LLaMEA\uff09\u5728AAD\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7a81\u53d8\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u540e\u7eed\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u63d0\u51faLLaMEA - SAGE\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8be5\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbLLaMEA\u66f4\u5feb\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u884d\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments.

Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts.

To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings.

Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (Springer)", "summary": "Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks.

So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches.

We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5165\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76147\u540d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u5bdfAI\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u8054\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174AI\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9891\u7e41\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u6096\u8bba\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u9075\u5faa\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u662f\u6210\u719f\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u8c28\u614e\u8005\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u793a\u4f8b\u624d\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u826f\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u3002"}}

Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \\emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4ee3\u5e01\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u4ee3\u5e01\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u5e01\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Transformer\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6807\u51c6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9\u4ee3\u5e01\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u77e9\u9635\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6df1\u5c42Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u9010\u4ee3\u5e01RMS\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u968f\u7740Transformer\u5c42\u6570\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u4ee3\u5e01\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u5e01\u6709\u7531\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u53cd\u6781\u914d\u7f6e\u6709\u6b63\u6982\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4ee3\u5e01\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u6781\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9Transformer\u4ee3\u5e01\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent.

However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{JADE} (\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faJADE\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "JADE\u5c06\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5757\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "JADE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528MLLM Interpreter\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5904\u7406PGPS\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528LLMs\u5904\u7406PGPS\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03MLLMs\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3MLLM Interpreter\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u9009\u7528CDL\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CoT\u589e\u5f3aSFT\u548cGRPO\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1CDL\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6Formalgeo7k - Rec - CoT\u3002", "result": "\u5728Formalgeo7k - Rec - CoT\u3001Unigeo\u548cMathVista\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ec5\u75285.5k\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90MLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6587\u672c\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528LLM\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u51b3PGPS\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\\% and 69.5\\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\\% and 140.1\\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption.

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines.

Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices.

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.\n  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints.

There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods.

In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces.

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths.

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

Detecting RPC Bugs in Ethereum Blockchain Client under Context", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": "The paper is accepted by ICSE 2026", "summary": "Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.\n  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations.

Additionally, we offer a proposed tiered priority framework for the SDGs namely, identifying upstream drivers (Education, Growth), enabling goals (Institutions, Energy), and downstream outcomes (Poverty, Health).

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa TACO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff08NCO\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763 NCO \u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5f52\u7eb3\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa TACO \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\u653e\u677e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4ece\u5934\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\uff0cTACO \u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763 NCO \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective.

Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch.

Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code.

A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.\n  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.\n  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.\n  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Thompson - sampling\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u62c9\u81c2\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u62c9\u81c2\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eUCB\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u201c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7bThompson - sampling\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u62c9\u81c2\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b21\u4f18\u81c2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u9006\u8fc7\u7a0b\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u81c2\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u62c9\u81c2\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u629b\u7269H\u00f6rmander\u6761\u4ef6\u548cStroock - Varadhan\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u7406\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u5173\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u62c9\u81c2\u8ba1\u6570\u6e10\u8fd1\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u624b\u81c2\u4e3a\u6b21\u4f18\u6216\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u81c2\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u6536\u655b\u5230SDE\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f8b\uff1b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u624b\u81c2\u5747\u503c\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u81c2\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u81c2\u662f\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bf8\u591a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u975e\u6b63\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u6613\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations.

We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both.

This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning.

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains.

Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \\textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \\textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \\textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities.

Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u4fd7\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u76ca\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6c11\u4fd7\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u4e1a\u5185\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6536\u96c6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6c11\u4fd7\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5bf912\u4f4d\u745e\u5178\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u4fd7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5373\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u4e14\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u4fd7\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4e0d\u826f\u6c11\u4fd7\u3002"}}

In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\\widetilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability.

However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research.

However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%.

This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$.

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term \"HYDRA\" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u793e\u533a\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CPS\uff09\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3b\u6743\u8303\u5f0fHYDRA\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952eCPS\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u5851\u6027 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faModular Sovereignty\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5236\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e93HYDRA\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5236\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u533a\u5206\u5076\u7136\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3aCPS\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts.

Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms.

We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability.

Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity.

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training.

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bCNRE\uff0c\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u591a\u7ea7\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8ffd\u6c42\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCNRE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CNRE\u4e3a\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5230\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0bcoverage@cost\u662f\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86pass@k\u548ccoverage@cost\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReD\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u52a0coverage@cost\u5e76\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u63d0\u5347coverage@cost\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReset - and - Discard (ReD)\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528HumanEval\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cReD\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe\u5230\u671f\u671b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u548c\u7f8e\u5143\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u5e42\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "ReD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0coverage@cost\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11pass@k\u65f6\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002"}}

However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales.

To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread \"False Certification\" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a \"Trojan\" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance.

An Investigation Into the Group-theoretic Structures Learned By Narrow Models Trained To Predict Group Operations", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": "Presented at TAG-DS 2025", "summary": "While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic.

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578bPARADIS\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e73\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e73\u6d41\u3001\u6269\u6563\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u534a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6d41\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u70b9\u6001\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u6e90\u9879\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "PARADIS\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5148\u8fdb\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728ERA5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PARADIS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdWishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3DP\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6307\u51faLoRA\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Wishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3DP\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u4f53\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u6548\u679c\uff1bLoRA\u975e\u56fa\u6709\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9690\u79c1\uff1b\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Wishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u76ca\u3002"}}

To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence.

The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3SWE - Spot - 4B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff08RCL\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u5355\u5143\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f53\u9a8c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3SWE - Spot - 4B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SWE - Spot - 4B\u6a21\u578b\u6253\u7834\u65e2\u5b9a\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6216\u5339\u914d\u6ce8\u91cd\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u638c\u63e1\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity.

Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds.

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5907\u4ef6\u5e93\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5fc5\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5907\u4ef6\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u5173\u952e\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u8fd0\u8425\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u672c - \u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u7eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u8425\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality.

Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.\n  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency.

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0cGreen AI\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63a2\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u4f1a\u4f7f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u7684Green AI\u8303\u5f0f\u5c06\u80fd\u8017\u89c6\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u8017\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5143\u6570\u548c\u6b7b\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c632\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u7ea7\u4fee\u6539\u4f1a\u4f7f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u662f\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4ea7\u751f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\u3002"}}

Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \\emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\\sim$1--4\\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\\sim$2--5\\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle. Controlled PSF studies show reduced FWHM and higher peak gradients, evidence of resolution recovery without edge erosion. Used as a plug-and-play preprocessor, it consistently boosts Dice for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation. Overall, the approach offers a practical, assumption-light path to robust US enhancement that generalizes across datasets, scanners, and degradation types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76f2\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u8bfb\u53d7\u6591\u70b9\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6761\u4ef6\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7528Swin\u5377\u79efU - Net\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u65cb\u8f6c/\u88c1\u526a\u5757\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4f4e\u79e9\u53bb\u566a\u83b7\u53d6\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aPSNR/SSIM\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0cPSF\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u5c11\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u548c\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8d85\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u51b3\u6ee4\u6ce2\u540e\u9a8c\u8def\u5f84\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u644a\u9500\uff0c\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u6216\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth.

Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones.

A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics.

In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios.

Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.\n  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.\n  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion.

For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $\u0398(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $\u0398(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$.

These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords.

To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5224\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347GC - MS\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "GC - MS\u5728\u6709\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u8d28\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5cf0\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5224\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u6eb6\u5242\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8eAI\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f7f\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u503c\u4fdd\u6301\u57280.9\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u6570\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347GC - MS\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584AI\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%.

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$).

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure.

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer.

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset.

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing.

Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \\textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions.

We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks.

However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u70b9\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u540e\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, many modern MoE systems still adopt linear routers in raw high-dimensional representation spaces, where representation mismatch, angular concentration, and scale-sensitive scoring can jointly undermine routing discriminability and stable expert specialization. In this work, we propose Low-rank \\& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry.

However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from \"what\" to learn to \"how much\" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers.

E-mail: zhuylin27@mail2.sysu.edu.cn", "summary": "Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709FedGFMs\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFedGALA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49 - \u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FedGFMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u9aa8\u5e72\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u77e5\u8bc6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedGALA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50GNN\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684PLM\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3PLM\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedGALA\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe14.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedGALA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3FedGFMs\u7684\u8bed\u4e49 - \u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDA - SPS\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u672a\u6709\u6548\u8003\u8651\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA - SPS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff08TVPS\uff09\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff08EVPS\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u52a0\u6743\u6c42\u548c\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5f97\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDA - SPS\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DA - SPS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning.

To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

Most existing studies focus on parameter uncertainty, such as variable processing times, and typically adopt the actor-critic framework. In this paper, we explore a different but prevalent form of uncertainty in JSSP: structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty arises when a job may follow one of several routing paths, and the selection is determined not by policy, but by situational factors (e.g., the quality of intermediate products) that cannot be known in advance. Existing methods struggle to address this challenge due to incorrect credit assignment: a high-quality action may be unfairly penalized if it is followed by a time-consuming path. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named UP-AAC. In contrast to conventional actor-critic methods, UP-AAC employs an asymmetric architecture. While its actor receives a standard stochastic state, the critic is crucially provided with a deterministic state reconstructed in hindsight. This design allows the critic to learn a more accurate value function, which in turn provides a lower-variance policy gradient to the actor, leading to more stable learning. In addition, we design an attention-based Uncertainty Perception Model (UPM) to enhance the actor's scheduling decisions.

The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates.

However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO.

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice.

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining.

Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\\times$ and KV cache by $R\\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\\% and decoding speedups up to 117\\% on long sequences.

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations.

We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding.

Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a \"Traffic-to-Image\" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a \"Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter\" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability.

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u72ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0cOneRec\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSAGE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u72ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caOneRec\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u2018\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAGE\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4e24\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSAGE\u6709\u6548\u758f\u901a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559GBPO\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\\% to 39.0\\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\\% to 10.02\\%.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLarge Lookup Layer (L\u00b3) \u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6cdb\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u8def\u7531\u7684Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) \u5c42\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165L\u00b3\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u8def\u7531\u4ee5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u591a26\u4ebf\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\uff0cL\u00b3\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u3002", "conclusion": "L\u00b3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors.

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeR2\u6c99\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u5bf9\u5168\u65b0\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u9009\u62e9\u6df7\u6dc6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DeR2\u6c99\u76d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u8bc1\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9632\u6b62\u53c2\u6570\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u51bb\u7ed3\u6587\u6863\u5e93\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faToolWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToolWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4e2d\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u8fd147000\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cToolWeaver\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolWeaver\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165VAF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u826f\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7406\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VAF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u70b9\u51fb\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53ca\u7387\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5bf98\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u5bb6\u65cf\u30015\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c4\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80cc\u666f\u989c\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u5b57\u4f53\u6837\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7VAF\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}}

Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search.

We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates.

On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches.

We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control.

Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types.

A core open challenge is the development of a mathematical formulation of hyperbolic neural networks that is both efficient and captures the key properties of hyperbolic space. The Lorentz model of hyperbolic space has been shown to enable both fast forward and backward propagation. However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane\" formulation. We prove that our formulation results in the usual linear scaling of output hyperbolic norms with respect to the number of gradient descent steps. Our new formulation, together with further algorithmic efficiencies through Lorentzian activation functions and a new caching strategy results in neural networks fully abiding by hyperbolic geometry while simultaneously bridging the computation gap to Euclidean neural networks.

Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgent Workflow Optimization (AWO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ca\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5143\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u52a8\u4f5c\u6346\u7ed1\u6210\u5355\u6b21\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406AI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAWO\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1111.9%\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53474.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "AWO\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data.

Existing approaches typically modify model parameters, but such updates can be unstable, computationally costly, and limited by local approximations.

Instead of modifying model parameters, we learn a transformation over representations that imposes an information bottleneck: maximizing mutual information with retained data while suppressing information about data to be forgotten. We derive variational surrogates that make this objective tractable and show how they can be instantiated in two practical regimes: when both retain and forget data are available, and in a zero-shot setting where only forget data can be accessed. Experiments across several benchmarks demonstrate that Representation Unlearning achieves more reliable forgetting, better utility retention, and greater computational efficiency than parameter-centric baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRepresentation Unlearning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Representation Unlearning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u6362\u65bd\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u53d8\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRepresentation Unlearning\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Representation Unlearning\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification.

However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions.

Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations.

First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one.

Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers.

Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f51\u7edcLSR - Net\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\u8f74\u627f\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f74\u627f\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bca\u65ad\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757DFEM\uff0c\u521b\u5efa3\u901a\u90532D\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5bf9\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u5757DM\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6df7\u6d17CES\u5757\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u6d17\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7528\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e5f\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LSR - Net\u80fd\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated.

However, its generalization ability in ALMs remains largely underexplored. We observe that conventional prompt tuning for ALMs also suffers from the Base-New Tradeoff, and we identify that this issue stems from the disrupted semantic structure of the embedding space. To address this issue, we propose Semantically Expanded Prompt Tuning (SEPT)-a plug-and-play framework that explicitly regularizes the prompt embedding space by incorporating semantic neighbors generated by large language models. SEPT introduces a novel semantic expansion loss with margin constraints that promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby enhancing the semantic structure of the prompt embedding space. For comprehensive evaluation, we establish the first benchmark setup for prompt generalization in ALMs, covering both base-to-new generalization and cross-dataset transferability.

Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set.

We propose a color histogram analysis method to examine lesion pixel values from three publicly available datasets: PH2, ISIC2016, and Med Node. The PH2 dataset contains ground truth annotations of lesion colors, while ISIC2016 and Med Node do not; our algorithm estimates the ground truth using color histogram analysis based on PH2. We then design and train a 19 layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual skip connections to classify lesions into three categories based on the number of colors present. DeepDream visualization is used to interpret features learned by the network, and multiple CNN configurations are tested. The best model achieves a weighted F1 score of 75 percent.

Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCORDS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u586b\u5145\u8868\u793a\u6216\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORDS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u573a", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b", "conclusion": "CORDS\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf"}}

However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts. Experimental results across eight SOTA LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, achieving a state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 97.1\\%.

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme.

Deep learning can accelerate imaging by reconstructing spectra from rapid, single-scan inputs. However, separating noise and baseline drift simultaneously without ground truth is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard black-box architectures often rely on statistical approximations that introduce spectral hallucinations or fail to generalize to unstable atmospheric conditions. To solve these issues we propose a physics-informed cascade Unet that separates denoising and baseline correction tasks using a new, deterministic Physics Bridge. This architecture forces the network to separate random noise from chemical signals using an embedded SNIP layer to enforce spectroscopic constraints instead of learning statistical approximations. We benchmarked this approach against a standard single Unet and a traditional Savitzky-Golay/SNIP workflow. We used a dataset of human hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (FaDu). The cascade model outperformed all other methods, achieving a 51.3% reduction in RMSE compared to raw single-scan inputs, surpassing both the single Unet (40.2%) and the traditional workflow (33.7%). Peak-aware metrics show that the cascade architecture eliminates spectral hallucinations found in standard deep learning. It also preserves peak intensity with much higher fidelity than traditional smoothing. These results show that the cascade Unet is a robust solution for diagnostic-grade FTIR imaging. It enables imaging speeds 32 times faster than current methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea7\u8054Unet\u7528\u4e8eFTIR\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6821\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728FaDu\u7ec6\u80de\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFTIR\u6210\u50cf\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5\u964d\u566a\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e34\u5e8a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u5149\u8c31\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea7\u8054Unet\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7269\u7406\u6865\u5206\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165SNIP\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u79bb\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u5728RMSE\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5355\u626b\u63cf\u8f93\u5165\u964d\u4f4e51.3%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355Unet\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5149\u8c31\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea7\u8054Unet\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u7ea7FTIR\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u6210\u50cf\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb32\u500d\u3002"}}

This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism.

In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum.

The root cause lies in the Hessian matrix of the LLM loss landscape: a few high curvature directions are extremely sensitive to perturbations. To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise. HeRo-Q requires no architectural modifications, incurs negligible computational overhead, and integrates seamlessly into existing PTQ pipelines. Experiments on Llama and Qwen models show that HeRo Q consistently outperforms state of the art methods including GPTQ, AWQ, and SpinQuant not only achieving superior performance under standard W4A8 settings, but also excelling in the highly challenging W3A16 ultra low bit regime, where it boosts GSM8K accuracy on Llama3 8B to 70.15\\% and effectively avoids the logical collapse commonly seen in aggressive quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHeRo - Q\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3PTQ\u2018\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672fPTQ\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8eLLM\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeRo - Q\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u538b\u7f29\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHeRo - Q\u5728\u6807\u51c6W4A8\u548c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6W3A16\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u573a\u666f\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eGPTQ\u3001AWQ\u548cSpinQuant\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Llama3 8B\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347GSM8K\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HeRo - Q\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3PTQ\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning. Overall, our work establishes a scalable methodology for standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and provides empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks.

AIG-SC raises a number of concerns from old debates about the line between pornography and obscenity, to newer debates about fair use and labor displacement (in this case, of sex workers), and spurred new regulations to curb the spread of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) created using the same technology used to create AIG-SC. However, despite the growing prevalence of AIG-SC, little is known about its creators, their motivations, and what types of content they produce. To inform effective governance in this space, we perform an in-depth study to understand what AIG-SC creators make, along with how and why they make it.

Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize.

Prior-fitted networks (PFNs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization in supervised tabular learning by amortizing Bayesian inference under a broad synthetic prior. Extending this paradigm to clustering is nontrivial: clustering is unsupervised, admits a combinatorial and permutation-invariant output space, and requires inferring the number of clusters. We introduce TabClustPFN, a prior-fitted network for tabular data clustering that performs amortized Bayesian inference over both cluster assignments and cluster cardinality. Pretrained on synthetic datasets drawn from a flexible clustering prior, TabClustPFN clusters unseen datasets in a single forward pass, without dataset-specific retraining or hyperparameter tuning.

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u5185\u6982\u7387\u4e58\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0IPS - GRPO\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cIPS - GRPO\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fee\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u975e\u6dfb\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.\n  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \\textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \\textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8fd0\u7528L\u2082 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528L\u2082 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eL\u2082 - \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6536\u76ca\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6539\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u4e60\u5f97\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u8bcd\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u8bcd\u53d8\u5f02\uff09\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3Pythia\u6a21\u578b\uff0814M - 410M\u53c2\u6570\uff09300B\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u57281B\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u548c\u52a8\u8bcd\u53d8\u5f02\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\uff1b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5e8f\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u540e\u671f\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\u9891\u8c31\u9971\u548c\u5f3a\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9971\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u5c0f\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u76ca\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u975e\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\u6765\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.\n  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.\n  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.\n  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AnthropoCam\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u73af\u5883\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u827a\u672f\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6ce8\u91cd\u7ed8\u753b\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u7eb9\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4fb5\u8680\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u7eb9\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u524d\u9988\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u8fbe\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u8bed\u4e49\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u666e\u901a\u79fb\u52a8\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a3 - 5\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cAnthropoCam\u4f7f\u795e\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u5b9e\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e3a\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u635f\u574f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4e3a\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u5355\u72ec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM).

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08PIDM\uff09\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1PIDM\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "BC\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\uff0cPIDM\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4f46\u4f18\u52bf\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPIDM\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c3D\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBC\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u6240\u9700\u793a\u8303\u6b21\u6570\u662fPIDM\u76843 - 5\u500d\uff1b\u57283D\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cBC\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6bd4PIDM\u591a\u8d8566%\u3002", "conclusion": "PIDM\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4BC\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002"}}

We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass.

On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOutput - Space Search (OS - Search)\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7aef\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684token/program\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7aef\u70b9\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u76843D\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4Z\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u6807z*\uff0c\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6545\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cZ\u7a7a\u95f4\u626b\u63cf\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9ad83.1\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cZ\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u544a\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OS - Search\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters.

Proof of Quality provides scalable verification by sampling evaluator nodes that score candidate outputs, then aggregating their scores into a consensus signal that determines rewards. However, evaluator heterogeneity and malicious score manipulation can distort consensus and inflate payouts, which weakens incentive alignment in open participation settings.\n  This paper extends a cost-aware Proof of Quality mechanism by adding adversary-resilient consensus formation. We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration. These findings motivate robust consensus as a default component for cost-aware Proof of Quality and provide practical guidance for selecting evaluator sampling parameters under adversarial risk and resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u6dfb\u52a0\u6297\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a0\u6743\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5206\u6570\u64cd\u7eb5\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6dfb\u52a0\u6297\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u548c\u622a\u5c3e\u5747\u503c\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a0\u6743\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b\u7528\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u6458\u8981\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u96c6\u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5956\u52b1\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u56de\u62a5\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u5171\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We introduce FISMO (Fisher-Structured Momentum-Orthogonalized) optimizer, which generalizes isotropic updates to incorporate anisotropic curvature information through Fisher information geometry. By reformulating the optimizer update as a trust-region problem constrained by a Kronecker-factored Fisher metric, FISMO achieves structured preconditioning that adapts to local loss landscape geometry while maintaining computational tractability. We establish convergence guarantees for FISMO in stochastic nonconvex settings, proving an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate for the expected squared gradient norm with explicit characterization of variance reduction through mini-batching.

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u4e09\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e186\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u7559\u4e09\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\u8d21\u732e\u6bd4\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads.

Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNetMamba+\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u6d41\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u5904\u7406\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNetMamba+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476.44%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.7\u500d\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8fbe261.87 Mb/s\u3002", "conclusion": "NetMamba+\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models.

KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge.

By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points).

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSHARP\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u5c3e\u90e8\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5747\u503c\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SHARP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5371\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5931\u8d25\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u548cCVaR95\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u5c3e\u90e8\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u8d85\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5404\u5371\u5bb3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fb9\u9645\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions.

We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons.

But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all.

Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u8c03\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u672a\u660e\u786e\u4ee3\u7801\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u4e24\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7528\u5708\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u6784\u5efa\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572883%\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples.

The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality-scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to \"induce interpretability\". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations.

Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up.

Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance.

Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner.

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets.

Human listening tests are the gold standard, but costly and impractical at scale. Fr\u00e9chet Distance has emerged as a promising alternative, yet its reliability depends heavily on the choice of embeddings and experimental settings. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate Fr\u00e9chet Speech Distance (FSD) and its variant Speech Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) under varied embeddings and conditions. We further incorporate human listening evaluations alongside TTS intelligibility and synthetic-trained ASR WER to validate the perceptual relevance of these metrics. Our findings show that WavLM Base+ features yield the most stable alignment with human ratings. While FSD and SMMD cannot fully replace subjective evaluation, we show that they can serve as complementary, cost-efficient, and reproducible measures, particularly useful when large-scale or direct listening assessments are infeasible.

However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability.

Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners.

Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices.

Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL.

To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents.

Existing detection studies mainly focus on manually edited speech with explicit splicing artifacts, and therefore struggle to cope with emerging end-to-end neural speech editing techniques that generate seamless acoustic transitions. To address this challenge, we first construct a large-scale bilingual dataset, AiEdit, which leverages large language models to drive precise semantic tampering logic and employs multiple advanced neural speech editing methods for data synthesis, thereby filling the gap of high-quality speech editing datasets. Building upon this foundation, we propose PELM (Prior-Enhanced Audio Large Language Model), the first large-model framework that unifies speech editing detection and content localization by formulating them as an audio question answering task. To mitigate the inherent forgery bias and semantic-priority bias observed in existing audio large models, PELM incorporates word-level probability priors to provide explicit acoustic cues, and further designs a centroid-aggregation-based acoustic consistency perception loss to explicitly enforce the modeling of subtle local distribution anomalies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PELM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the HumanEdit and AiEdit datasets, achieving equal error rates (EER) of 0.57\\% and 9.28\\% (localization), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53cc\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6 AiEdit\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa PELM \u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa AiEdit \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa PELM \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u5fc3\u805a\u5408\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "PELM \u5728 HumanEdit \u548c AiEdit \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08EER\uff09\u5206\u522b\u4e3a 0.57% \u548c 9.28%\uff08\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PELM \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions.

In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors.

Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher).

In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions.

However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits.

Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence.

However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings.

Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges.

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline.

However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs.

Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest. We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step. For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task.

Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eea\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4e\u5c42\u5927\u6c14\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u98ce\u573a\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7528\u534f\u540c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u5efa\u56db\u7ef4\u5927\u6c14\u98ce\u573a\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u534f\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u98ce\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eea\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u5927\u6c14\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u53ea\u80fd\u6cbf\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6574\u6062\u590d\u98ce\u573a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6e4d\u6d41\u73af\u5883\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Bi - LSTM\uff09\u4ece\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c40\u90e8\u98ce\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u8fde\u7eed\u98ce\u573a\u3002", "result": "Bi - LSTM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u901f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6c34\u5e73\u98ce\u5206\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u6062\u590d1000\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u98ce\u573a\u4e3b\u8981\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u901f\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u573a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u4e0d\u540cRMSE\uff0c\u4e94\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u540c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u98ce\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u98ce\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $\u0394t$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF).

In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks.

Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request.

However, existing methods typically operate at a single level of granularity, limiting their ability to model the diverse temporal and spectral structures inherent in complex audio signals. Furthermore, bootstrapping representations from scratch is computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training to converge. In this work, we propose the Convolutional Audio Transformer (CAT), a unified framework designed to address these challenges. First, to capture hierarchical audio features, CAT incorporates a Multi-resolution Block that aggregates information across varying granularities. Second, to enhance training efficiency, we introduce a Representation Regularization objective. Drawing inspiration from generative modeling, this auxiliary task guides the student model by aligning its predictions with high-quality semantic representations from frozen, pre-trained external encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms baselines on audio understanding benchmarks.

State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations.

This perspective particularly leverages the Rashomon Effect, where multiple models exhibit similar predictive performance but rely on diverse internal structures. Instead of considering these multiple models, choosing a single best model risks masking alternative narratives embedded in the data. To address this, we employed this perspective in the interpretation of a large-scale psychological dataset, specifically focusing on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. We use a random forest model combined with partial dependence profiles to rigorously assess the robustness and stability of predictive relationships across the resulting Rashomon set, which consists of multiple models that exhibit similar predictive performance. Our findings confirm that demographic variables \\texttt{age}, \\texttt{sex}, and \\texttt{education} lead to consistent structural shifts in anxiety and depression risk. Crucially, we identify significant temporal effects: risk probability demonstrates clear diurnal and circaseptan fluctuations, peaking during early morning hours.

This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step.

High-resolution climate hazard indicators are integrated with a Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), an index derived from classification of 2.6 billion geotagged tweets using fine-tuned open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). These indicators are aggregated to the US county-level and mapped to a structural equation model to infer overall climate risk and human flourishing dimensions, including expressed well-being, meaning and purpose, social connectedness, psychological distress, physical condition, economic stability, religiosity, character and virtue, and institutional trust. The results reveal spatially heterogeneous associations between greater cumulative climate risk and lower levels of expressed human flourishing, with coherent spatial patterns corresponding to recurrent exposure to heat, flooding, wind, drought, and wildfire hazards.

Project page: https://vcbsl.github.io/VoxMorph/", "summary": "Morphing techniques generate artificial biometric samples that combine features from multiple individuals, allowing each contributor to be verified against a single enrolled template. While extensively studied in face recognition, this vulnerability remains largely unexplored in voice biometrics. Prior work on voice morphing is computationally expensive, non-scalable, and limited to acoustically similar identity pairs, constraining practical deployment. Moreover, existing sound-morphing methods target audio textures, music, or environmental sounds and are not transferable to voice identity manipulation. We propose VoxMorph, a zero-shot framework that produces high-fidelity voice morphs from as little as five seconds of audio per subject without model retraining. Our method disentangles vocal traits into prosody and timbre embeddings, enabling fine-grained interpolation of speaking style and identity. These embeddings are fused via Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) and synthesized using an autoregressive language model coupled with a Conditional Flow Matching network.

Although existing computational approaches have been proposed for site-of-metabolism prediction, they typically ignore cytochrome P450 isoform identity or model isoforms independently, thereby failing to fully capture inherent cross-isoform metabolic patterns. In addition, prior evaluations often rely on top-k metrics, where false positive atoms may be included among the top predictions, underscoring the need for complementary metrics that more directly assess binary atom-level discrimination under severe class imbalance. We propose ATTNSOM, an atom-level site-of-metabolism prediction framework that integrates intrinsic molecular reactivity with cross-isoform relationships. The model combines a shared graph encoder, molecule-conditioned atom representations, and a cross-attention mechanism to capture correlated metabolic patterns across cytochrome P450 isoforms. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets annotated with site-of-metabolism labels at atom resolution. Across these benchmarks, the model achieves consistently strong top-k performance across multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms. Relative to ablated variants, the model yields higher Matthews correlation coefficient, indicating improved discrimination of true metabolic sites. These results support the importance of explicitly modeling cross-isoform relationships for site-of-metabolism prediction.

This setup not only enables applicability across a range of practical scenarios, but also helps maximize model performance. However, the impact of prompt design remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of commonly used prompts across diverse datasets, showing that prompt choice significantly affects ASR performance and introduces instability, with no single prompt performing best across all cases.

To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training.

The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u5728SoftGym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728SoftGym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

We assume throughout that the set of all of these random variables follows a joint Gaussian distribution, and that we have the covariance matrix available. Finally, we measure information using Shannon's differential entropy.\n  The main approach for exact solution of moderate-sized instances of MERSP has been branch-and-bound, and so previous work concentrated on upper bounds. Prior to our work, there were two upper-bounding methods for MERSP: the so-called NLP bound and the spectral bound, both introduced 25 years ago. We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound. In addition, the augmented NLP formulation allows us to derive upper bounds for rank-deficient covariance matrices when they satisfy a technical condition. This is in contrast to the earlier work on the ordinary NLP bound that worked with only positive definite covariance matrices.

We establish optimal convergence rates for the proposed framework under a general source condition, providing a theoretical foundation for regularized learning in this setting.

While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\u0394$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|\u0394$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|\u0394$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.\n  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets.

However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

We release Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers", "summary": "Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting.

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact.

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process.

Yet, beneath the efficiency gains lie subtle erosions of human expertise and agency. This paper shifts focus from the future of work to the future of workers by navigating the AI-as-Amplifier Paradox: AI's dual role as enhancer and eroder, simultaneously strengthening performance while eroding underlying expertise. We present a year-long study on the longitudinal use of AI in a high-stakes workplace among cancer specialists. Initial operational gains hid ``intuition rust'': the gradual dulling of expert judgment. These asymptomatic effects evolved into chronic harms, such as skill atrophy and identity commoditization. Building on these findings, we offer a framework for dignified Human-AI interaction co-constructed with professional knowledge workers facing AI-induced skill erosion without traditional labor protections. The framework operationalizes sociotechnical immunity through dual-purpose mechanisms that serve institutional quality goals while building worker power to detect, contain, and recover from skill erosion, and preserve human identity. Evaluated across healthcare and software engineering, our work takes a foundational step toward dignified human-AI interaction futures by balancing productivity with the preservation of human expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u764c\u75c7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aAI\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u2018\u76f4\u89c9\u751f\u9508\u2019\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u5173\u6ce8AI\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u80cc\u540e\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u4fb5\u8680\uff0c\u4ece\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8f6c\u5411\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e3a\u671f\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u764c\u75c7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u957f\u671f\u4f7f\u7528AI\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u671f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u76ca\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u2018\u76f4\u89c9\u751f\u9508\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u65e0\u75c7\u72b6\u5f71\u54cd\u6f14\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u6280\u80fd\u840e\u7f29\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7b49\u957f\u671f\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\u7ecf\u533b\u7597\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u5c0a\u4e25\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4fdd\u5b58\u3002"}}

The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\\%)$ for $(M_{\\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\u7684VAE\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u9690\u8868\u793a\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u5305\u542b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728Skyrme\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VAE\uff0c\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efaSkyrme\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a0.15%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u5929\u6587\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment.

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples.

Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability.

Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous.

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods.

Building on these insights and established filmmaking principles, we developed Vidmento, a tool for authoring hybrid video stories that combine captured and generated media through context-aware expansion. Vidmento surfaces opportunities for story development, generates clips that blend stylistically and narratively with surrounding media, and provides controls for refinement.

DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSymbXRL\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u672a\u67656G\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56DRL\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46DRL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSymbXRL\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7AI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63cf\u8ff0\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1SymbXRL\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u6bd4\u7eafDRL\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u9ad812%\u3002", "conclusion": "SymbXRL\u6280\u672f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53bb\u9664DRL\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term \"order robustness\". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment.

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6b65\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u901a\u4fe1\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u610f\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u611f\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6b65\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u901a\u4fe1\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u7279\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6d88\u606f\uff1b\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b\u610f\u4e49\u4ee5\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e16\u754c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u624d\u80fd\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d8c\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining.

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision.

To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources.

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels.

However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory.

In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result.

However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks.

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.\n  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data.

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models.

Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following.

In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers?

We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdEditYourself\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5f55\u4fee\u6539\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u90e8\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u9884\u5f55\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u805a\u7126\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u5c55\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08V2V\uff09\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fee\u590d\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u65b0\u6dfb\u52a0\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c6\u9891\u540e\u671f\u5236\u4f5c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of \"instruction-tuning\" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With \"supervised\" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.
