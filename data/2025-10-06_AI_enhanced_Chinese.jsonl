In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or\nmodels of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware\nof its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum\nstochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2\ndeceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an\nadvantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor\nselection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor\nselection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for\nselection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not\ndeviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper\nbound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1\nhas perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making\nalgorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the\npresumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value.

These limitations make current approaches\nill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud\ndeployments.\n  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that\nachieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling.

A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism\nmigrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory\nusage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.\n  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that\nElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput\nduring scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to\nbaselines.

However, most production\nworkloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most\nresearch systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in\ncompression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific\ncompressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of\nthe data being compressed.

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three.

On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels\nwith multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with\nnarrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance\nslope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a\ngiven turnover budget.

Recognizing this, we show it is possible\nto adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample\ncomplexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low\nprobability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from\nconditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the\nspecial case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how\ndiffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to\nmodel tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through\nempirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial\ndataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly\noutperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response\ndistributions at the extreme tail conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c3e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03 $P(Y|X=x)$ \u4e14 $P(X=x)$ \u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u6837\u672c\u5c11\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u6761\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u6761\u4ef6\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u524d\u5411\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c3e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We\nformalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and\nidentify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for\nhierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting\npreferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance\nand compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an\nopen-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow\norchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we\nfind they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint\nadherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a\ndifficult open problem.

However, modeling becomes increasingly\nchallenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the\nsystem behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the\nparameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model\nclass of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a\nBayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records;\npredictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can\nthen be made.

However, achieving effective\nauto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not\nonly on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,\nand deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked\nin existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods\nunder realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical\nauto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling\nmethods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we\nclassify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:\nArchitecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers\nhigh-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service\ndependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization\noverhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase\nfocuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We\nvalidate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate\ndiverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,\nlearning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches.

Although no data is actively altered, such\nreconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational\nbehavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this\nthreat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and\noften disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single\ntimeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification.

How good are FMs at performing joint\nreasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when\nthe modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?\nTo better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:\nscenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This\nallows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason\njointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can\nrecognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of\nthe time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across\nmodalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of\nmultiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,\nshowing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,\ndisproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal\nattention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or\nmultilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that\nexplicitly require cross-modal reasoning.

Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K\nsteadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does\nnot hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain\nhard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.\nInterestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different\nsubsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only\npart of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also\nenables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning\n(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide\na comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature\nvoting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling.

However, there is little consensus on the correct method for\ncomparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in\nphilosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the\nInter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to\naccurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using\nthe IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and\nbrain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject\nusing the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We\nidentify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network\nmodels, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a\nproof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural\nengineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal\nof identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided\ntransforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural\nnetworks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system.

Research on GNN expressivity has\nproduced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies\nwith models of increasing expressive power.

To\ndate, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN\nexpressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural\nway to enhance the expressivity of GNNs.

Under Review", "summary": "Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests\nand diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to\nanswer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user\nrequest increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond\nthe final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including\npreviously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.\nThe most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an\nagent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is\nfundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is\nprohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to\nassess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the\nagents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By\nincorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from\npreceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and\nevaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our\nframework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing\nbenchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with\nmulti-faceted performance scores.

Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of\ngenerated code, but there is far less on code quality.\n  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating\nthe quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which\nthe quality of LLM generated code should be improved.\n  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code\nquality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of\nprofessionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets\naccording to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to\nrepresent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also\npresent an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with\nthe Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four\nstate-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.\n  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code\nsmells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with\na smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)\nand finally Codex (84.97%).

Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that\nMINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the\npotential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.\nNotably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based\nand actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost.

A Kriging meta-model is\nemployed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify\noptimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional\nparameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3\nand 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,\nwhile those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower\nnatural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to\nrigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a\npurpose-built inspection vehicle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6865\u6881\u635f\u4f24\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528AAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cKriging\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u6bd4\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u91cd\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f7d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6865\u6881\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u8f66\u8f86\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08AAE\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u53d7\u635f\u6865\u6881\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u635f\u4f24\u6307\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8f74\u8f66\u8f86\u8f6e\u80ce\u60ac\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u521a\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Kriging\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u9891\u7387\u6bd4\u57280.3 - 0.7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5171\u632f\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8f83\u8f7b\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u4f4e\u56fa\u6709\u9891\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8f66\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u67e5\u8f66\u8f86\u3002"}}

This result reveals a qualitative difference\nbetween small and large learning rates $\\eta$. With a learning rate below a\ntopological critical point $\\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve\nall topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\\eta^*$, the\nlearning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron\nmanifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.\nViewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability\nphenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can\nbe divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under\ntopological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through\ndrastic topological simplifications.

This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In\nstark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the\ndiscrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation.\nIt maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively\nneutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit.

However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function.

Extensive experiments on\nLlama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)\ndemonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput\n(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to\n80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTokenFlow\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62a2\u5360\u5f0f\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3001P99 TTFT\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u975e\u62a2\u5360\u5f0f\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u8bf7\u6c42\u7a81\u53d1\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8bf7\u6c42\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "TokenFlow\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ee4\u724c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5360\u7528\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bf7\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5728GPU\u548cCPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fbKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7fI/O\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u53e0\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bf7\u6c42\u62a2\u5360\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591aGPU\u4e0a\u5bf9Llama3 - 8B\u548cQwen2.5 - 32B\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTokenFlow\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534782.5%\uff0cP99 TTFT\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e80.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u4ee4\u724c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenFlow\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss.

In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that\ndiagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and\nits gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to\nprovide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training\ndata. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking\nharmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge\ncontamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at\nsample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,\nprecisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence\nmodel behavior.

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this\npaper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose\nenhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation\n(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance\nof the prediction interval using the ground truth.

Speculative decoding addresses this by\nemploying a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified\nin parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains.

Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length.

Recently, researchers\nhave proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to\nalleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic\nincompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively\naddress these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable\ntraining framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter\n(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each\nTransformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk\nattention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the\nmodel, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic\ninformation. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain\nfrozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.\nNotably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK\nAdapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks.

In this\nwork, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,\ninstance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to\na specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,\nand local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a\ncommon source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often\ndepends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on\nmaking decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context\nrequires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,\nvalidating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We\nformalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce\nour task-agnostic method to solve it.

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the\ninsight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.\nWithout modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two\nmechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by\ncomparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a\ndual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''\nstored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles\nand enabling adaptation.

Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

Design:\nRetrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH\nOCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and\nADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was\nfine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data\nincluded paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical\nreports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans\nwere labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model\nwas evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,\nglaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical\nsectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,\nprecision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using\nstandard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and\n0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86\n(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91).

However, this fixed target\nusually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's\noutput distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the\nsubstantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing\nattacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which\nmight still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target\nLLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking\nframework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the\nadversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples\nmultiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned\non the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary\ntarget for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA\nsignificantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output\ndistribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an\neffective adversarial prompt.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency\nof DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations\nto achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\\% on recent\nsafety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\\%. The\ntime cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines.

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.

Unlike traditional deep neural\nnetworks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase,\nwhich processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase,\nwhich generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse\ncompute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly\nchallenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference\nor evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long\ncontext regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely\nunderexplored.\n  We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for\nthese unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM\ninference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip\nanalog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further\nimprove the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy\nthat adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute\nbound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high\nthroughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in\nthe decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement\nwithin DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs\nof LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip\nanalog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate\nHALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models.

To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained\naltogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal\noverhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward\nrobust multimodality medical object detection.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work\nzones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and\ndynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we conduct the \\textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone\ntrajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct\ntrajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first\nidentify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and\nthen confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human\nverification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory\nplanning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG).

With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from\nsocial media, automated methods for personality assessment have become\nincreasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis\nof unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main\nchallenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,\npersonality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology\nand NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these\nchallenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --\ncollected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse\ndiscussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000\nusers and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic\ninformation, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.\nExperiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model\nvalidity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality\nAssessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for\ninterpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements\nwith validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic\nsimilarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human\nevaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency.

This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that\nreveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible\nmanner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related\ntrajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion\nmodels to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions.\nWe then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the\naforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is\nemployed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model\nusing a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint\nviolations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for\nseparate focused and often tedious data generation phases.

While beauty remains a\nculturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,\ndeep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic\njudgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to\nrepresent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the\nterm applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational\nconvergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned\nrepresentations between models which have been trained on distinct data and\nmodalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned\nrepresentations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful\nimages has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially\nconstructed values.

To address common issues\nfrom time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during\nrecovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This\napproach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also\nenhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical\napplications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data\nfrom unauthorized access.

In many cases, constraints are enforced via\nprojections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent\nyears, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of\nprojected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.\nStrong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via\nMoreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work\non unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the\ngradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation\nthat convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as\nmini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD\nfor non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the\ndistance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the\nconstraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly\nused criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without\nrequiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent,\nidentically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In\nthese cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic\nbounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID\nsub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and\nhigh-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds.

Furthermore, existing methods typically\nrequire a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap\nbetween the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low\nattack efficiency.\n  To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the\nfirst gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an\nunsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we\nformulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability\nof the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the\nobjective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two\ndifferentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and\nthe corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate\nthe decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's\nunrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more\nflexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\\% attack success rates\nagainst recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and\nCOLD-Attack by over 20\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u76ee\u6807\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff08UJA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u4e3a\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "UJA\u5728\u4ec5100\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8580%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad820%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "UJA\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms.

While prior work demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to\nreal-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and\nsingle-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,\nthe NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order\nmodulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates\ndirectly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher\ndata rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails\nhigher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural\nnetwork architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,\nresulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental\nresults over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the\n5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are\nparticularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are\nprevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier\nsystems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling\neffective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels.

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing\ninternal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This\nprocess both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token\ngeneration latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs\ncommunicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%\nhigher average accuracy than individual models.

In contrast, Planning\nDomain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal\nplanning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these\ncomplementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into\nPDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem\nfiles satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain\nfiles, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely\non human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access\nfor refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can\nautonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual\nplanning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A\nSimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and\na GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the\nPDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world\ndomains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game\nrules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,\nsimulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal\nreaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of\nSimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for\nunseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.
