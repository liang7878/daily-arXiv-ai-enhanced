However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u68c0\u7d22\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u786e\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7528\u53d7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u56de\u590d\u3002"}}

This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness).

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis.

In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm.

An important capability in e-Commerce with hierarchical taxonomies is to select a set of relevant leaf categories that are semantically aligned with a given user query. In this scope, we address a fundamental problem of search query categorization in real-world e-Commerce taxonomies. A correct categorization of a query not only provides a way to zoom into the correct inventory space, but opens the door to multiple intent understanding capabilities for a query. A practical and accurate solution to this problem has many applications in e-commerce, including constraining retrieved items and improving the relevance of the search results. For this task, we explore a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that combines simple tree-search with LLM semantic scoring. Assessing its classification performance on human-judged query-category pairs, relevance tests, and LLM-based reference methods, we find that the CoT approach performs better than a benchmark that uses embedding-based query category predictions.

While attention-based and transformer-inspired models offer increased modeling flexibility, extensive empirical evaluation reveals that a carefully constructed vanilla LSTM consistently achieves superior predictive accuracy and more stable buy/sell decision-making when trained under a common set of default hyperparameters.

However, this potential is yet to be realized as KGs are notoriously difficult to interact with via their query language SPARQL for many user groups alike. Additionally, a further hindrance for user-KG interaction is the fundamental disconnect between user requirements and requirements KGs have to fulfill regarding machine-interoperability, reasoning tasks, querying, and further technical requirements. Thus, many statements in a KG are of no semantic significance for end users. In this work, we investigate a potential remedy for this challenge: Semantic Units (SUs) are semantically significant, named subgraphs in a KG with the goal to enhance cognitive interoperability for users, and to provide responses to common KG modelling challenges. We model and construct a KG from publication and dataset metadata of the Biodiversity Exploratories (BE), a research platform for functional biodiversity research across research plots in Germany to contribute to biodiversity research from the perspective of computer science. We contribute further by delivering the first implementation of semantic units on a knowledge graph and investigate how SUs impact KG querying. Finally, we present two implementations of tasks that show how large language models (LLMs) can be used to extract structured metadata categories from publication and dataset titles and abstracts, and how embedding models can be used to enrich metadata with latent information, in an effort to support the creation of structured and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) metadata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u751f\u6001\u548c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u521b\u5efa\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u867d\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u548c\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8981\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u9648\u8ff0\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u9898\u3001\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u6570\u636e\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548cFAIR\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

While polynomial-time approximation algorithms exist for restricted graph classes, general bounds remain loose or computationally expensive. In this paper, we exploit optimum cycle means (minimum and maximum cycle means), which are computable in strongly polynomial time, to derive both strict algebraic bounds and heuristic approximations for the weight and length of the longest simple cycle. We rigorously analyze the algebraic relationships between these mean statistics and the properties of longest cycles, and present dual results for shortest cycles. While the strict bounds provide polynomial-time computable constraints suitable for pruning search spaces in branch-and-bound algorithms, our proposed heuristic approximations offer precise estimates for the objective value. Experimental evaluation on ISCAS benchmark circuits demonstrates this trade-off: while the strict algebraic lower bounds are often loose (median 85--93% below true values), the heuristic approximations achieve median errors of only 6--14%.

Inspired by the serverless framework of Function as a Service and the high concurrency and robustness of MapReduce programming model, this paper focus on combining them to reduce the time span and increase the efficiency when executing the word frequency counting task. In this case, the paper use a MapReduce programming model based on a serverless computing platform to figure out the most optimized number of Map functions and Reduce functions for a particular task. For the same amount of workload, extensive experiments show both execution time reduces and the overall efficiency of the program improves at different rates as the number of map functions and reduce functions increases.

In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy.

Counterfactuals and Interdependence", "categories": ["econ.GN"], "comment": "This version is a preprint intended for journal submission. Pages 31", "summary": "Many empirical studies estimate causal effects in environments where economic units interact through spatial or network connections. In such settings, outcomes are jointly determined, and treatment induced shocks propagate across economically connected units. A growing literature highlights identification challenges in these models and questions the causal interpretation of estimated spillovers. This paper argues that the problem is more fundamental. Under interdependence, causal effects are not uniquely defined objects even when the interaction structure is correctly specified or consistently learned, and even under ideal identifying conditions. We develop a causal framework for firm-level economies in which interaction structures are unobserved but can be learned from predetermined characteristics. We show that learning the network, while necessary to model interdependence, is not sufficient for causal interpretation. Instead, causal conclusions hinge on explicit counterfactual assumptions governing how outcomes adjust following a treatment change. We formalize three economically meaningful counterfactual regimes partial equilibrium, local interaction, and network, consistent equilibrium, and show that standard spatial autoregressive estimates map into distinct causal effects depending on the counterfactual adopted. We derive identification conditions for each regime and demonstrate that equilibrium causal effects require substantially stronger assumptions than direct or local effects. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates that equilibrium and partial-equilibrium effects differ mechanically even before estimation, and that network feedback can amplify bias when identifying assumptions fail.

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u6545\u969c\u793a\u4f8b\u9002\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5e38\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5bf9 14 \u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u793a\u4f8b\u603b\u6570\uff1b\u5c11\u4e8e 20 \u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5360\u4f18\uff1b30 - 50 \u4e2a\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 10 \u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u7f72\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In addition, both linear and nonlinear machine learning techniques are employed to forecast the UFR and ultra-long-term bond yields.

We compare agent behavior under Ethereum's default 12-second slot time environment with a faster regime that offers 1-second subslot execution.

Despite their success, the provided tools and methodologies remain limited if high-dimensional dynamical systems subject to initial uncertainty and/or stochastic noise are encountered; in particular if rare events are of interest. We address this open challenge by borrowing ideas from Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Chorin's optimal prediction method. The novelty of our work lies on employing time-dependent optimal projection of the dynamic on a desired set of resolved variables. We show several theoretical and numerical properties of our model reduction approach. In particular, we show that the devised surrogate trajectories are consistent with the probability flow of the full-order system. Furthermore, we identify the measure underlying the projection through polynomial chaos expansion technique. This allows us to efficiently compute the projection even for trajectories that are initiated on low probability events. Moreover, we investigate the introduced model-reduction error of the surrogate trajectories on a standard setup, characterizing the convergence behaviour of the scheme. Several numerical results highlight the computational advantages of the proposed scheme in comparison to Monte-Carlo and optimal prediction method. Through this framework, we demonstrate that by tracking the measure along with the consistent projection of the dynamic we are able to access accurate estimates of different statistics including observables conditional on a given initial configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u501f\u9274Mori - Zwanzig\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u548cChorin\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u542b\u521d\u59cb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6bd4\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53d7\u521d\u59cb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c/\u6216\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u65f6\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274Mori - Zwanzig\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u548cChorin\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u5df2\u89e3\u6790\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u6280\u672f\u786e\u5b9a\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5168\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6295\u5f71\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u964d\u9636\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6d4b\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5305\u62ec\u7ed9\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002"}}

Data-driven ROMs are explainable, computationally efficient scientific machine learning models that aim to preserve the underlying physics of complex dynamical simulations. Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples.

Recent approaches address these issues through two independent directions that leverage large language models (LLMs): (1) generating synthetic queries for fine-tuning, and (2) generating auxiliary contexts to support relevance matching. However, both directions overlook the diverse academic concepts embedded within scientific documents, often producing redundant or conceptually narrow queries and contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce an academic concept index, which extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them guided by an academic taxonomy. This structured index serves as a foundation for improving both directions. First, we enhance the synthetic query generation with concept coverage-based generation (CCQGen), which adaptively conditions LLMs on uncovered concepts to generate complementary queries with broader concept coverage. Second, we strengthen the context augmentation with concept-focused auxiliary contexts (CCExpand), which leverages a set of document snippets that serve as concise responses to the concept-aware CCQGen queries.

The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u6c22\u6c14\u8f93\u9001\u7ba1\u9053\u710a\u7f1d\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eX80\u94a2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u710a\u7f1d\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6c22\u6c14\u8f93\u9001\u7ba1\u9053\u710a\u7f1d\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u7ba1\u9053\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u6c22\u6c14\u7ba1\u9053\u65f6\u710a\u63a5\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u673a\u68b0\u710a\u63a5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u573a\u7684\u8026\u5408\u53d8\u5f62 - \u6269\u6563 - \u65ad\u88c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u710a\u7f1d\u8fdb\u884c\u865a\u62df\u65ad\u88c2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u865a\u62df\u65ad\u88c2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u5931\u6548\u538b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u710a\u7f1d\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u710a\u63a5\u7f3a\u9677\u5bf9\u542b\u6c22\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We first establish a novel connection between adaptive security and \\textit{fairness}, leveraging fair ANN search to hide internal randomness from the adversary with information-theoretic guarantees. To achieve data-independent performance, we then reduce the search problem to a robust decision primitive, solved using a differentially private mechanism on a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) data structure. This approach, however, faces an inherent $\\sqrt{n}$ query time barrier. To break the barrier, we propose a novel concentric-annuli LSH construction that synthesizes these fairness and differential privacy techniques.

Discrete-event simulators are faster and cheaper, but they require re-implementing the serving system's control logic -- a burden that compounds as frameworks evolve.\n  We present Revati, a time-warp emulator that enables performance modeling by directly executing real serving system code at simulation-like speed. The system intercepts CUDA API calls to virtualize device management, allowing serving frameworks to run without physical GPUs.

Log4j is an industrial-grade Java logging framework listed as one of the top 100 critical open source projects. On Dec. 10, 2021 a severe vulnerability Log4Shell was disclosed before being fully patched with Log4j2 version 2.17.0 on Dec. 18, 2021. However, to this day about 4.1 million, or 33 percent of all Log4j downloads in the last 7 days contain vulnerable packages. Many Log4Shell scanners have since been created to detect if a user's installed Log4j version is vulnerable. Current detection tools primarily focus on identifying the version of Log4j installed, leading to numerous false positives, as they do not check if the software scanned is really vulnerable to malicious actors. This research aims to develop an advanced Log4j scanning tool that can evaluate the real-world exploitability of the software, thereby reducing false positives. Our approach first identifies vulnerabilities and then provides targeted recommendations for mitigating these detected vulnerabilities, along with instant feedback to users. By leveraging GitHub Actions, our tool offers automated and continuous scanning capabilities, ensuring timely identification of vulnerabilities as code changes occur. This integration into existing development workflows enables real-time monitoring and quicker responses to potential threats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating 28 open-source software projects across different releases, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4% from a sample of 140 scans. Our GitHub action implementation is available at the GitHub marketplace and can be accessed by anyone interested in improving their software security and for future studies.

A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC'2017 benchmark suite.

A randomised controlled field experiment with three treatment groups and a control group was used to study the effectiveness of three informational interventions. Participants in each treatment group received a distinct informational intervention: cost-based, range-based, and norm-based. Two of the three interventions (range-based and norm-based), designed to reduce behavioural and psychological barriers, were found to be significant. The cost-based intervention was not significant, suggesting that financial motives alone may not be sufficient to lead to an increase in the adoption of electric vehicles. The significant effect observed for the range-based and norm-based interventions suggests that the discomfort related to the technology must be addressed, and social norms can be effectively utilised to promote electric vehicles at low cost. Although adoption is not guaranteed with self-reported intentions, the findings suggest that carefully framed informational interventions guide behavioural intentions towards sustainable technologies.

Crashes are identified using the Hellinger distance and Hilbert spectrum; a crash occurs when HD = mu\\_H + 2*sigma\\_H, segmenting data into pre-crash, crash, and post-crash periods. Conditional p-threshold MI filters out common market effects and applies permutation-based significance testing. Resulting validated dependencies are used to construct MST networks for comparison across periods. Networks become more integrated during the crash, with shorter path lengths, higher centrality, and lower algebraic connectivity, indicating fragility. Core-periphery structure declines, with increased periphery vulnerability, and disassortative mixing facilitates shock transmission. Post-crash networks show only partial recovery. Aftershock analysis using the Gutenberg-Richter law indicates higher relative frequency of large volatility events following the crash. Results are consistent across all markets, highlighting the conditional p-threshold MI framework for capturing nonlinear interdependencies and systemic vulnerability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6761\u4ef6p\u9608\u503c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606fMST\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u51a0\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u6574\u5408\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u540e\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6p\u9608\u503c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528Hellinger\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHilbert\u8c31\u8bc6\u522b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6p\u9608\u503cMI\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e02\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMST\u7f51\u7edc\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u671f\u3002", "result": "\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6838\u5fc3 - \u5916\u56f4\u7ed3\u6784\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u5916\u56f4\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u540e\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f59\u9707\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5927\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6761\u4ef6p\u9608\u503cMI\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

This study proposes a multimodal framework that integrates structured credit variables, climate panel data, and unstructured textual narratives within a unified learning architecture. Specifically, we use long short-term memory (LSTM), the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and transformer models to analyse the interplay between these data modalities. The empirical results demonstrate that unimodal models based on climate or text data outperform those relying solely on structured data, while the integration of multiple data modalities yields significant improvements in credit default prediction. Using SHAP-based explainability methods, we find that physical climate risks play an important role in default prediction, with water-logging by rain emerging as the most influential factor.

In these settings, conventional optimization methods quickly become impractical due to prohibitive computational costs and poor scalability. We propose ALMAB-DC, a unified and modular framework for scalable black-box optimization that integrates active learning, multi-armed bandits, and distributed computing, with optional GPU acceleration. The framework leverages surrogate modeling and information-theoretic acquisition functions to guide informative sample selection, while bandit-based controllers dynamically allocate computational resources across candidate evaluations in a statistically principled manner. These decisions are executed asynchronously within a distributed multi-agent system, enabling high-throughput parallel evaluation. We establish theoretical regret bounds for both UCB-based and Thompson-sampling-based variants and develop a scalability analysis grounded in Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws. Empirical results across synthetic benchmarks, reinforcement learning tasks, and scientific simulation problems demonstrate that ALMAB-DC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.

KRCD leverages reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to model complex dependencies. By comparing standard and higherorder kernel regressions, we derive a test statistic whose significant deviation from zero indicates unobserved confounding. Theoretically, we prove two key results: First, in infinite samples, regression coefficients coincide if and only if no unobserved confounders exist.

Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes.

The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u7cca\u8ba4\u77e5\u56fe\uff08FCM\uff09\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u63d0\u53d6\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6df7\u5408FCM\u6709\u65b0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u53cd\u9988FCM\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88FCM\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u540d\u8bcd\u3001FCM\u6982\u5ff5\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\uff0c\u7528Kissinger\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u6b65\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684FCM\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u5747\u8861\u6781\u9650\u73af\uff0c\u6df7\u5408FCM\u5438\u6536\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6210\u5206\u5747\u8861\u5e76\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u53d6FCM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6df7\u5408FCM\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, balancing the governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions remains challenging, particularly in fracture mechanics, where accurate predictions strongly depend on refined sampling near crack tips. To overcome these limitations, a Kolosov-Muskhelishvili informed neural network with Williams enrichment is developed in this study. Benefiting from the holomorphic representation, the governing equations are satisfied by construction, and only boundary points are required for training. Across a series of benchmark problems, the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili informed neural network shows excellent agreement with analytical and finite element method references, achieving average relative errors below 1\\% and $R^2$ above 0.99 for both mode I and mode II loadings. Furthermore, three crack propagation criteria (maximum tangential stress, maximum energy release rate, and principle of local symmetry) are integrated into the framework using a transfer learning strategy to predict crack propagation directions. The predicted paths are nearly identical across all criteria, and the transfer learning strategy reduces the required training time by more than 70\\%. Overall, the developed framework provides a unified, mesh-free, and physically consistent approach for accurate and efficient crack propagation analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5e26\u6709Williams\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684Kolosov - Muskhelishvili\u77e5\u8bc6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65ad\u88c2\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u88c2\u7eb9\u5c16\u7aef\u7cbe\u7ec6\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e26\u6709Williams\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684Kolosov - Muskhelishvili\u77e5\u8bc6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5168\u7eaf\u8868\u793a\u4f7f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e0e\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\uff0c$R^2$\u9ad8\u4e8e0.99\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u51c6\u5219\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8570%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u65e0\u7f51\u683c\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

But the payoff may be limited if latch-free techniques require executing wasted work. In this paper, we show how latch-free techniques exploit delta record updating and can significantly reduce wasted work by using notices, a new latch-free approach.

For a given full rank matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ where $n \\gg d$, $\\mathbf{X}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is an $(\\varepsilon,\\ell_p)$-subspace embedding of $\\mathbf{X}$, if for every $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, $(1-\\varepsilon)\\|\\mathbf{Xq}\\|_{p}^{p} \\leq \\|\\mathbf{X'q}\\|_{p}^{p} \\leq (1+\\varepsilon)\\|\\mathbf{Xq}\\|_{p}^{p}$. Specifically, in this paper, $\\mathbf{X}'$ is a weighted subset of rows of $\\mathbf{X}$ which is commonly known in the literature as a coreset. In every iteration, the algorithm ensures that the loss on the maintained set is upper and lower bounded by the loss on the original dataset with appropriate scalings. So, unlike typical coreset guarantees, due to bounded loss, our coreset gives a deterministic guarantee for the $\\ell_p$ subspace embedding.

Their goal is to democratize sophisticated -- often AI-based -- investing tools. We identify and demonstrate a fundamental profitability-fairness tradeoff in CoinAlgs that we call the CoinAlg Bind: CoinAlgs cannot ensure economic fairness without losing profit to arbitrage. We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs.

Using free-tier cloud resources, we offer a transparent methodology for POS workload evaluation that small retailers and researchers can use. Our approach measures important performance metrics like response latency, throughput, and scalability while estimating operational costs based on actual resource usage and current public cloud pricing because there is no direct billing under free-tier usage. All the tables and figures in this study are generated directly from code outputs, ensuring that the experimental data and the reported results are consistent. Our analysis shows that GCP achieves 23.0% faster response times at baseline load, while Azure shows 71.9% higher cost efficiency for steady-state operations. We look at the architectural components that lead to these differences and provide a helpful framework for merchants considering cloud point-of-sale implementation.

This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention.

We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver.

Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon.

On the other hand, the unweighted versions of these problems have recently witnessed the sought-after speedups. Currently, the only way to repurpose the algorithm of the unweighted version for the weighted version is to employ a polynomial embedding of the input weights. This, however, introduces a pseudo-polynomial factor into the running time, which becomes impractical for arbitrarily weighted instances.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new way to repurpose the algorithm of the unweighted problem. Specifically, we show that the time complexity of several well-known NP-hard problems operating over the $(\\min, +)$ and $(\\max, +)$ semirings, such as TSP, Weighted Max-Cut, and Edge-Weighted $k$-Clique, is proportional to that of their unweighted versions when the set of input weights has small doubling.

Although edge-cloud collaborative inference with speculative decoding (SD) can reduce end-to-end latency by executing a lightweight draft model at the edge and verifying it with a cloud-side target model, existing frameworks fundamentally rely on tight coupling between the two models. Consequently, repeated model synchronization introduces excessive communication overhead, increasing end-to-end latency, and ultimately limiting the scalability of SD in edge environments. To address these limitations, we propose FlexSpec, a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework tailored for evolving edge-cloud systems. The core design of FlexSpec is a shared-backbone architecture that allows a single and static edge-side draft model to remain compatible with a large family of evolving cloud-side target models. By decoupling edge deployment from cloud-side model updates, FlexSpec eliminates the need for edge-side retraining or repeated model downloads, substantially reducing communication and maintenance costs. Furthermore, to accommodate time-varying wireless conditions and heterogeneous device constraints, we develop a channel-aware adaptive speculation mechanism that dynamically adjusts the speculative draft length based on real-time channel state information and device energy budgets.

Unlike function-level code generation, it requires the model to understand the entire repository, reasoning over complex dependencies across functions, classes, and modules.

In this paper, we introduce InlineCoder, a novel framework for repository-level code generation. InlineCoder enhances the understanding of repository context by inlining the unfinished function into its call graph, thereby reframing the challenging repository understanding as an easier function-level coding task. Given a function signature, InlineCoder first generates a draft completion, termed an anchor, which approximates downstream dependencies and enables perplexity-based confidence estimation. This anchor drives a bidirectional inlining process: (i) Upstream Inlining, which embeds the anchor into its callers to capture diverse usage scenarios; and (ii) Downstream Retrieval, which integrates the anchor's callees into the prompt to provide precise dependency context.

Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.\n  Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u975e\u6cd5\u6309\u6469\u573a\u6240\uff08IMBs\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684IMBWatch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "IMBs\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8fd0\u8425\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ST - GNN\uff09\u7684IMBWatch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5f00\u6e90\u60c5\u62a5\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIMBWatch\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "IMBWatch\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u6e90\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The estimator is motivated by difficulties with the computation of existing spectral density estimators for time series of functions defined on very large grids that arise, for example, in climate compute models and medical scans. Existing estimators use autocovariance kernels represented as large $G \\times G$ matrices, where $G$ is the number of grid points on which the functions are evaluated. In many recent applications, functions are defined on 2D and 3D domains, and $G$ can be of the order $G \\sim 10^5$, making the evaluation of the autocovariance kernels computationally intensive or even impossible. We use the theory of spectral functional principal components to derive our deep learning estimator and prove that it is a universal approximator to the spectral density under general assumptions. Our estimator can be trained without computing the autocovariance kernels and it can be parallelized to provide the estimates much faster than existing approaches.

Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game.

However, due to the thin-walled nature of arteries, traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approaches based on full-dimensional volume modeling often require extremely fine particle spacing to ensure numerical convergence for the solid mechanics. This, in turn, leads to redundant resolution in the fluid domain to maintain sufficient kernel support near the fluid-solid interface in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient reduced-dimensional shell-based SPH method for modeling thin-walled deformable arteries, and conduct FSI for capturing hemodynamics and arterial wall mechanics. Through a series of validation cases, the proposed shell model demonstrates comparable accuracy in fluid dynamics to the volume model, while achieving faster convergence in solid mechanics and reduced computational cost. We further investigate the influence of wall compliance on flow transitions and key hemodynamic indices, highlighting the necessity of FSI modeling over rigid-wall assumptions. Finally, the method is applied to two patient-specific vascular geometries, i.e. the carotid artery and the aorta, which demonstrates its robustness, efficiency and physiological relevance in realistic cardiovascular simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u7ef4SPH\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u8584\u58c1\u53d8\u5f62\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u7ef4\u4f53\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u7c92\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u8584\u58c1\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6536\u655b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u7ef4SPH\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8584\u58c1\u53d8\u5f62\u52a8\u8109\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d41\u56fa\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u58c1\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \\textbf{KELP} (\\textbf{K}elp \\textbf{E}volutionary \\textbf{L}og \\textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency.

However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data. Our study provides a landmark framework to guide method selection and tailored model design for future ERP analysis.

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances.

We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant \"hallucination tax\": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.\n  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned \"digital twin\" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational.

CCPO entails many laborious and complex workflows and also requires extensive effort pertaining to heuristic algorithm development, where the combination of pooled heuristic solutions results in improved efficient frontiers. Hence, common approaches are to develop many heuristic algorithms. Agentic frameworks emerge as a promising candidate for many problems within combinatorial optimization, as they have been shown to be equally efficient with regard to automating large workflows and have been shown to be excellent in terms of algorithm development, sometimes surpassing human-level performance. This study implements a novel agentic framework for the CCPO and explores several concrete architectures. In benchmark problems, the implemented agentic framework matches state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, complex workflows and algorithm development efforts are alleviated, while in the worst case, lower but acceptable error is reported.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aCCPO\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "CCPO\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4e3aCCPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5177\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eCCPO\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5f00\u53d1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Compression schemes must be able to exploit the similarity, or smoothness, of consecutive numbers and must be able to contend with extreme conditions, such as high-precision values or the absence of smoothness. We present DeXOR, a novel framework that enables decimal XOR procedure to encode decimal-space longest common prefixes and suffixes, achieving optimal prefix reuse and effective redundancy elimination. To ensure accurate and low-cost decompression even with binary-decimal conversion errors, DeXOR incorporates 1) scaled truncation with error-tolerant rounding and 2) different bit management strategies optimized for decimal XOR. Additionally, a robust exception handler enhances stability by managing floating-point exponents, maintaining high compression ratios under extreme conditions. In evaluations across 22 datasets, DeXOR surpasses state-of-the-art schemes, achieving a 15% higher compression ratio and a 20% faster decompression speed while maintaining a competitive compression speed.

Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of the RAFT protocol, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to security threats such as message replay attacks and message forgery attacks. Examined how a malicious actor can exploit the protocol's message-passing mechanism to reintroduce old messages, disrupting the consensus process and leading to data inconsistency. The practical feasibility of these attacks is examined through simulated scenarios, and the key weaknesses in RAFT's design that enable them are identified. To address these vulnerabilities, a novel approach based on cryptography, authenticated message verification, and freshness check is proposed.

Learnable parameters that delay spike times can improve classification performance in temporal tasks, but existing methods rely on large networks and offline learning, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce synaptic and axonal delays to leaky integrate and fire (LIF)-based feedforward and recurrent SNNs, and propose three-factor learning rules to simultaneously learn delay parameters online. We employ a smooth Gaussian surrogate to approximate spike derivatives exclusively for the eligibility trace calculation, and together with a top-down error signal determine parameter updates. Our experiments show that incorporating delays improves accuracy by up to 20% over a weights-only baseline, and for networks with similar parameter counts, jointly learning weights and delays yields up to 14% higher accuracy. On the SHD speech recognition dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy to offline backpropagation-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it reduces model size by 6.6x and inference latency by 67%, with only a 2.4% drop in classification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a sparse Tucker decomposition method with graph regularization for high-dimensional vector autoregressive time series. By stacking the time-series transition matrices into a third-order tensor, the sparse Tucker decomposition is employed to characterize important interactions within the transition third-order tensor and reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, the graph regularization is employed to measure the local consistency of the response, predictor and temporal factor matrices in the vector autoregressive model.The two proposed regularization techniques can be shown to more accurate parameters estimation. A non-asymptotic error bound of the estimator of the proposed method is established, which is lower than those of the existing matrix or tensor based methods. A proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm is designed to solve the resulting model and its global convergence is established under very mild conditions.

Submitted to IEEE IATMSI-2026 (Track: AI, IoT and Computer Vision Enabled Technologies)", "summary": "Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection.

Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage.

To showcase how to use agents working in tandem with developers, we designed a novel approach for carrying out coordinated renaming. Coordinated renaming, where a single rename refactoring triggers refactorings in multiple, related identifiers, is a frequent yet challenging task. Developers must manually propagate these rename refactorings across numerous files and contexts, a process that is both tedious and highly error-prone. State-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches produce an overwhelming number of false positives, while vanilla Large Language Models (LLMs) provide incomplete suggestions due to their limited context and inability to interact with refactoring tools. This leaves developers with incomplete refactorings or burdens them with filtering too many false positives. Coordinated renaming is exactly the kind of repetitive task that agents can significantly reduce the developers' burden while keeping them in the driver's seat.\n  We designed, implemented, and evaluated the first multi-agent framework that automates coordinated renaming. It operates on a key insight: a developer's initial refactoring is a clue to infer the scope of related refactorings. Our Scope Inference Agent first transforms this clue into an explicit, natural-language Declared Scope. The Planned Execution Agent then uses this as a strict plan to identify program elements that should undergo refactoring and safely executes the changes by invoking the IDE's own trusted refactoring APIs.

However, their large computational cost, huge memory footprints, and high processing power/energy make it challenging for their embedded deployments. Amid several tinyLLMs, recent works have proposed spike-driven language models (SLMs) for significantly reducing the processing power/energy of LLMs. However, their memory footprints still remain too large for low-cost and resource-constrained embedded devices. Manual quantization approach may effectively compress SLM memory footprints, but it requires a huge design time and compute power to find the quantization setting for each network, hence making this approach not-scalable for handling different networks, performance requirements, and memory budgets. To bridge this gap, we propose QSLM, a novel framework that performs automated quantization for compressing pre-trained SLMs, while meeting the performance and memory constraints. To achieve this, QSLM first identifies the hierarchy of the given network architecture and the sensitivity of network layers under quantization, then employs a tiered quantization strategy (e.g., global-, block-, and module-level quantization) while leveraging a multi-objective performance-and-memory trade-off function to select the final quantization setting. Experimental results indicate that our QSLM reduces memory footprint by up to 86.5%, reduces power consumption by up to 20%, maintains high performance across different tasks (i.e., by up to 84.4% accuracy of sentiment classification on the SST-2 dataset and perplexity score of 23.2 for text generation on the WikiText-2 dataset) close to the original non-quantized model while meeting the performance and memory constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faQSLM\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3SLM\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\uff0cSLMs\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4ecd\u5927\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "QSLM\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u5c42\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6743\u8861\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u6700\u7ec8\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "QSLM\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1186.5%\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e20%\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "QSLM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3SLM\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\\{f_u\\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \\emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \\texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \\texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \\emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension.

Decentralized integrity is verified via step (sigma_S) and data (sigma_D) checksums, facilitating autonomous malicious deviation detection and atomic abort without requiring persistent coordination. The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines.

To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations.

The system consists of a set of serial processing tasks, each with a given duration, unit execution cost, and precedence constraints, which must be assigned to an unlimited number of stations subject to a per-station duration bound. The objective is to minimize the total production cost, modeled as a station-wise function of task costs and the duration bound, while strictly satisfying all prerequisite and capacity constraints. Two chromosome encoding strategies are investigated: a station-based representation implemented using the JGAP library with SuperGene validity checks, and a task-based representation in which genes encode station assignments directly. For each encoding, standard GA operators (crossover, mutation, selection, and replacement) are adapted to preserve feasibility and drive the population toward lower-cost schedules. Experimental results on three classes of precedence structures-tightly coupled, loosely coupled, and uncoupled-demonstrate that the task-based encoding yields smoother convergence and more reliable cost minimization than the station-based encoding, particularly when the number of valid schedules is large. The study highlights the advantages of GA over gradient-based and analytical methods for combinatorial scheduling problems, especially in the presence of complex constraints and non-differentiable cost landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u4ea7\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u4ea7\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u524d\u63d0\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u67d3\u8272\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u6807\u51c6\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning.

Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models.

Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems.

Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets.

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design. FlashInfer-Bench thus establishes a practical, reproducible pathway for continuously improving AI-generated kernels and deploying them into large-scale LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlashInfer - Bench\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210GPU\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbFlashInfer - Bench\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fFlashInfer Trace\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6392\u884c\u699c\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashInfer - Bench\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdbAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paradigm shift raises a critical question: can we predict which agent-generated PRs will consume excessive review effort before any human interaction begins?\n  Analyzing 33,707 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across 2,807 repositories, we uncover a striking two-regime behavioral pattern that fundamentally distinguishes autonomous agents from human developers. The first regime, representing 28.3 percent of all PRs, consists of instant merges (less than 1 minute), reflecting success on narrow automation tasks. The second regime involves iterative review cycles where agents frequently stall or abandon refinement (ghosting).\n  We propose a Circuit Breaker triage model that predicts high-review-effort PRs (top 20 percent) at creation time using only static structural features. A LightGBM model achieves AUC 0.957 on a temporal split, while semantic text features (TF-IDF, CodeBERT) provide negligible predictive value. At a 20 percent review budget, the model intercepts 69 percent of total review effort, enabling zero-latency governance.\n  Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in AI-assisted code review: review burden is dictated by what agents touch, not what they say, highlighting the need for structural governance mechanisms in human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56f4\u7ed5AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\uff08PR\uff09\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cfPR\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684PR\u4f1a\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u591a\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cbe\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790AIDev\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d2807\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u768433707\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u521b\u5efa\u7684PR\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCircuit Breaker\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cfPR\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u7c7bPR\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0cLightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u4e0aAUC\u8fbe0.957\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u4f4e\uff0c\u572820%\u5ba1\u67e5\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u62e6\u622a69%\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218AI\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u7531\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff08AEs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u653b\u51fbAEs\u4f7f\u5176\u8d8a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u7684AEs\u7ea0\u6b63\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u6ce8\u91cdAE\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u653b\u51fb\u524d\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea0\u6b63AEs\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u653b\u51fbAEs\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8d8a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c06AEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684AEs\u7ea0\u6b63\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u6297\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u4ea7\u751f\u7684AEs\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training.

In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u504f\u4f46\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6709\u504f\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u5de7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f6f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Exploring the Belief-Dependent Vulnerability", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": "16 pages", "summary": "LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u52a9\u529b\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4ee3\u7406 - \u4eba\u7c7b\u5212\u5206\u4e0b\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u5f85\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff08BPA\uff09\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff08BPA - PP\uff09\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff08BPA - MP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u548cBPA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

We propose Physio-DPO, a physics informed alignment framework that grounds protein language models in thermodynamic stability. Physio-DPO introduces a magnitude aware objective that scales optimization updates according to the energy gap between native structures and physics perturbed hard negatives. Experiments show that Physio-DPO consistently outperforms strong baselines including SFT, PPO, and standard DPO, reducing self consistency RMSD to 1.28 \u00c5 and increasing foldability to 92.8%.

Embedded within a generator-discriminator framework, these mechanisms shift validation responsibilities from users to the system.

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning.

Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faClinicalReTrial\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8bd5\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u8bae\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6570\u8bd5\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5931\u8d25\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClinicalReTrial\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u5019\u9009\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "ClinicalReTrial\u6539\u5584\u4e8683.3%\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u63d0\u9ad85.7%\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4fee\u6539\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ClinicalReTrial\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination.

In swarm research, the use of game theory methods holds the promise of explaining observed phenomena of collective utility adherence with rational self-interested swarm participants. In financial markets, a better understanding of how independent financial agents may self-organize for the betterment and stability of the marketplace would be a boon for market design researchers. This paper unifies Liquidity Games, where trader payoffs depend on aggregate liquidity within a trade, with Rational Swarms, where decentralized agents use difference rewards to align self-interested learning with global objectives. We offer a theoretical frameworks where we define a swarm of traders whose collective objective is market liquidity provision while maintaining agent independence. Using difference rewards within a Markov team games framework, we show that individual liquidity-maximizing behaviors contribute to overall market liquidity without requiring coordination or collusion.

Binary neural networks (BNNs) have recently gained attention as energy and memory efficient models suitable for resource constrained environments; however, training BNNs exactly is computationally challenging because of its discrete characteristics. Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine. The numerical results indicate that the proposed regularisation terms modify training behaviour and yield improvements in classification accuracy on data not present in the training set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08BNNs\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55QUBO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u51f8\u663e\uff0cBNNs\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709QUBO\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u88d5\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8edropout\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c06QUBO\u516c\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u7684Ising\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdbBNNs\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions.

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

Under review", "summary": "Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks.

However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $\u03bc$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation.

A Methodology for Football with Broader Applications", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": "Submitted to Sci (MDPI) for peer review", "summary": "This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems.

We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high.

To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks.

We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight.

We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law.

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPedX - LLM\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLaVA\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA - 2 - 7B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "PedX - LLM\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe82.0%\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53472.9%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53474.1%\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u738766.9%\uff0c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8fbe72.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "PedX - LLM\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure.

Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit.

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds.

Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7NeRF\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406EEG\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6b65\u548c\u7535\u6781\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u6781\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274NeRF\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0eEEG\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u5934\u76ae\u7535\u6781\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a8\u65ad\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u7528NeRF\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u5355\u4e2aEEG\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ea7\u751f\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u539f\u59cbEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62dfEEG\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7535\u6781\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u51c6EEG\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features.

Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents.

While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step.

This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5bf916\u79cd\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6309\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c42\u6b21\uff0cEBMs\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\uff0cSR\u548cIGANNs\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0cGOSDT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To study these coupled tradeoffs quantitatively, and to ensure they remain meaningful under real implementation constraints, we build a cross-layer toolchain that supports photonic AI design from early exploration to physical realization. SimPhony provides implementation-aware modeling and rapid cross-layer evaluation, translating physical costs into system-level metrics so architectural decisions are grounded in realistic assumptions. ADEPT and ADEPT-Z enable end-to-end circuit and topology exploration, connecting system objectives to feasible photonic fabrics under practical device and circuit constraints.

However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining.

To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert.

DNA methylation, as a stable yet dynamic epigenetic modification, holds promise as a noninvasive biomarker for early AD detection. However, methylation signatures vary substantially across tissues and studies, limiting reproducibility and translational utility. To address these challenges, we develop MethConvTransformer, a transformer-based deep learning framework that integrates DNA methylation profiles from both brain and peripheral tissues to enable biomarker discovery. The model couples a CpG-wise linear projection with convolutional and self-attention layers to capture local and long-range dependencies among CpG sites, while incorporating subject-level covariates and tissue embeddings to disentangle shared and region-specific methylation effects. In experiments across six GEO datasets and an independent ADNI validation cohort, our model consistently outperforms conventional machine-learning baselines, achieving superior discrimination and generalization. Moreover, interpretability analyses using linear projection, SHAP, and Grad-CAM++ reveal biologically meaningful methylation patterns aligned with AD-associated pathways, including immune receptor signaling, glycosylation, lipid metabolism, and endomembrane (ER/Golgi) organization.

This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called \"Twin Peaks\".

However, existing methods often treat heartbeats as homogeneous signals, overlooking the phase-specific characteristics within the cardiac cycle. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Phase-Aware Fusion~(HPAF) framework that explicitly avoids cross-feature entanglement through a three-stage design. In the first stage, Intra-Phase Representation (IPR) independently extracts representations for each cardiac phase, ensuring that phase-specific morphological and variation cues are preserved without interference from other phases. In the second stage, Phase-Grouped Hierarchical Fusion (PGHF) aggregates physiologically related phases in a structured manner, enabling reliable integration of complementary phase information. In the final stage, Global Representation Fusion (GRF) further combines the grouped representations and adaptively balances their contributions to produce a unified and discriminative identity representation. Moreover, considering ECG signals are continuously acquired, multiple heartbeats can be collected for each individual. We propose a Heartbeat-Aware Multi-prototype (HAM) enrollment strategy, which constructs a multi-prototype gallery template set to reduce the impact of heartbeat-specific noise and variability.

We address both gaps through a systematic analysis of the IEMOCAP dataset.\n  For recognition, we conduct a rigorous ablation study with 10-seed evaluation and report three key findings. First, conversational context is paramount, with performance saturating rapidly -- 90\\% of the total gain achieved within just the most recent 10--30 preceding turns (depending on the label set). Second, hierarchical sentence representations help at utterance-level, but this benefit disappears once conversational context is provided, suggesting that context subsumes intra-utterance structure. Third, external affective lexicons (SenticNet) provide no gain, indicating that pre-trained encoders already capture necessary emotional semantics. With simple architectures using strictly causal context, we achieve 82.69\\% (4-way) and 67.07\\% (6-way) weighted F1, outperforming prior text-only methods including those using bidirectional context.\n  For linguistic analysis, we analyze 5,286 discourse marker occurrences and find a significant association between emotion and marker positioning ($p < .0001$). Notably, \"sad\" utterances exhibit reduced left-periphery marker usage (21.9\\%) compared to other emotions (28--32\\%), consistent with theories linking left-periphery markers to active discourse management.

Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($\u03ba=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\\times$ speedup.

We propose FM-Singer, which introduces conditional flow matching (CFM) in latent space to learn a continuous vector field transporting prior latents toward posterior latents along an optimal-transport-inspired path.

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate.

This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms.

The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function.

While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u6307\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6f02\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u798f\u514b - \u666e\u6717\u514b\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u7528\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b - \u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u71b5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u71b5\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u54cd\u5e94\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating English counterfactuals and demonstrate multilingual proficiency. However, their effectiveness in generating multilingual counterfactuals remains unclear. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on multilingual counterfactuals. We first conduct automatic evaluations on both directly generated counterfactuals in the target languages and those derived via English translation across six languages. Although translation-based counterfactuals offer higher validity than their directly generated counterparts, they demand substantially more modifications and still fall short of matching the quality of the original English counterfactuals. Second, we find the patterns of edits applied to high-resource European-language counterfactuals to be remarkably similar, suggesting that cross-lingual perturbations follow common strategic principles. Third, we identify and categorize four main types of errors that consistently appear in the generated counterfactuals across languages. Finally, we reveal that multilingual counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) yields larger model performance improvements than cross-lingual CDA, especially for lower-resource languages.

Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91caDNN\u5bf9\u6297\u9003\u907f\u653b\u51fb\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7406\u8bba\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u5f31\u70b9\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u7528\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5305\u62ec\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6307\u6807\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

API specification, which includes detailed documentation and usage constraints, and 2. API execution, which captures runtime challenges. Consequently, WildAGTEval offers (i) an API system encompassing 60 distinct complexity scenarios that can be composed into approximately 32K test configurations, and (ii) user-agent interactions for evaluating LLM agents on these scenarios. Using WildAGTEval, we systematically assess several advanced LLMs and observe that most scenarios are challenging, with irrelevant information complexity posing the greatest difficulty and reducing the performance of strong LLMs by 27.3%.

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Advanced single-cell multimodal assays can now simultaneously measure various molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, Protein) across hundreds of thousands of individual cells, providing a comprehensive molecular readout. A significant analytical challenge is integrating single-cell measurements across different modalities. Various methods have been developed to address this challenge, but there has been no systematic evaluation of these techniques with different preprocessing strategies. This study examines a general pipeline for single-cell data analysis, which includes normalization, data integration, and dimensionality reduction. The performance of different algorithm combinations often depends on the dataset sizes and characteristics. We evaluate six datasets across diverse modalities, tissues, and organisms using three metrics: Silhouette Coefficient Score, Adjusted Rand Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. Our experiments involve combinations of seven normalization methods, four dimensional reduction methods, and five integration methods. The results show that Seurat and Harmony excel in data integration, with Harmony being more time-efficient, especially for large datasets.

Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts.

SEs, generated by LLMs to justify their own outputs, require reasoning about the model's own decision-making process, a capability that may exhibit particular sensitivity to quantization. As SEs are increasingly relied upon for transparency in high-stakes applications, understanding whether and to what extent quantization degrades SE quality and faithfulness is critical. To address this gap, we examine two types of SEs: natural language explanations (NLEs) and counterfactual examples, generated by LLMs quantized using three common techniques at distinct bit widths. Our findings indicate that quantization typically leads to moderate declines in both SE quality (up to 4.4\\%) and faithfulness (up to 2.38\\%). The user study further demonstrates that quantization diminishes both the coherence and trustworthiness of SEs (up to 8.5\\%). Compared to smaller models, larger models show limited resilience to quantization in terms of SE quality but better maintain faithfulness. Moreover, no quantization technique consistently excels across task accuracy, SE quality, and faithfulness. Given that quantization's impact varies by context, we recommend validating SE quality for specific use cases, especially for NLEs, which show greater sensitivity. Nonetheless, the relatively minor deterioration in SE quality and faithfulness does not undermine quantization's effectiveness as a model compression technique.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u793a\u4f8b\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u591a4.4%\u3001\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u591a2.38%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6700\u591a8.5%\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff1b\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u6700\u4f18\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u70ed\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548c\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u4f9b\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7531Q\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u6700\u4f18\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5fb7\u91cc\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u4e58\u5ba2\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea656%\uff0c\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1138%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, widely used depression datasets like DAIC-WOZ exhibit strong coupling between linguistic sentiment and diagnostic labels, encouraging models to learn semantic shortcuts. As a result, model robustness may be compromised in real-world scenarios, such as Camouflaged Depression, where individuals maintain socially positive or neutral language despite underlying depressive states. To mitigate this semantic bias, we propose DepFlow, a three-stage depression-conditioned text-to-speech framework. First, a Depression Acoustic Encoder learns speaker- and content-invariant depression embeddings through adversarial training, achieving effective disentanglement while preserving depression discriminability (ROC-AUC: 0.693). Second, a flow-matching TTS model with FiLM modulation injects these embeddings into synthesis, enabling control over depressive severity while preserving content and speaker identity. Third, a prototype-based severity mapping mechanism provides smooth and interpretable manipulation across the depression continuum. Using DepFlow, we construct a Camouflage Depression-oriented Augmentation (CDoA) dataset that pairs depressed acoustic patterns with positive/neutral content from a sentiment-stratified text bank, creating acoustic-semantic mismatches underrepresented in natural data. Evaluated across three depression detection architectures, CDoA improves macro-F1 by 9%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional augmentation strategies in depression Detection.

This paper (i) formalizes synthetic reality as a layered stack (content, identity, interaction, institutions), (ii) expands a taxonomy of GenAI harms spanning personal, economic, informational, and socio-technical risks, (iii) articulates the qualitative shifts introduced by GenAI (cost collapse, throughput, customization, micro-segmentation, provenance gaps, and trust erosion), and (iv) synthesizes recent risk realizations (2023-2025) into a compact case bank illustrating how these mechanisms manifest in fraud, elections, harassment, documentation, and supply-chain compromise. We then propose a mitigation stack that treats provenance infrastructure, platform governance, institutional workflow redesign, and public resilience as complementary rather than substitutable, and outline a research agenda focused on measuring epistemic security. We conclude with the Generative AI Paradox: as synthetic media becomes ubiquitous, societies may rationally discount digital evidence altogether.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e26\u6765\u5408\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5371\u5bb3\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5371\u5bb3\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5806\u6808\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5371\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u5806\u6808\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6210\u5408\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u5206\u5c42\u5806\u6808\u3001\u5371\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u8bf4\u660e\u53ca\u6848\u4f8b\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u5408\u6210\u5a92\u4f53\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u6027\u5730\u5426\u5b9a\u6570\u5b57\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5373\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6096\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5411\u56de\u5e94\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u611f\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237 - \u5934\u50cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e22\u5f03\u7528\u6237\u6761\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5931\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6500ms\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb6.8\u500d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u8d8580%\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

The high-frequency branch is equipped with a fine-grained structural attention module (FSAM) to enhance textures and edges for detecting small anomalies, while the low-frequency branch uses a global structural context module (GSCM) to capture long-range dependencies and preserve semantic consistency.

However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5e38\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51faIRPO\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u56e0\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u7b49\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Bradley - Terry\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165GRPO\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "IRPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u70b9\u5f0fGRMs\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u3002", "conclusion": "IRPO\u80fd\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the persistent challenge of LLM hallucination has emerged as a critical limitation, significantly compromising the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. This challenge has garnered significant attention within the scientific community, prompting extensive research efforts in hallucination detection and mitigation strategies. Current methodological frameworks reveal a critical limitation: traditional uncertainty quantification approaches demonstrate effectiveness primarily within conventional question-answering paradigms, yet exhibit notable deficiencies when confronted with non-canonical or adversarial questioning strategies. This performance gap raises substantial concerns regarding the dependability of LLM responses in real-world applications requiring robust critical thinking capabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing an uncertainty quantification scenario in the task of generating with multiple facts. We have meticulously constructed a set of trap questions contained with fake names. Based on this scenario, we innovatively propose a novel and robust uncertainty quantification method(RU). A series of experiments have been conducted to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the constructed set of trap questions performs excellently. Moreover, when compared with the baseline methods on four different models, our proposed method has demonstrated great performance, with an average increase of 0.1-0.2 in ROCAUC values compared to the best performing baseline method, providing new sights and methods for addressing the hallucination issue of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5RU\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5047\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RU\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0e\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cROCAUC\u503c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad80.1 - 0.2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance.

In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates.

Among these, patch-based adversarial attacks, where small malicious patches (e.g., stickers) are applied to objects, can deceive neural networks into making incorrect predictions with potentially severe consequences. In this paper, we present PatchBlock, a lightweight framework designed to detect and neutralize adversarial patches in images. Leveraging outlier detection and dimensionality reduction, PatchBlock identifies regions affected by adversarial noise and suppresses their impact. It operates as a pre-processing module at the sensor level, efficiently running on CPUs in parallel with GPU inference, thus preserving system throughput while avoiding additional GPU overhead. The framework follows a three-stage pipeline: splitting the input into chunks (Chunking), detecting anomalous regions via a redesigned isolation forest with targeted cuts for faster convergence (Separating), and applying dimensionality reduction on the identified outliers (Mitigating). PatchBlock is both model- and patch-agnostic, can be retrofitted to existing pipelines, and integrates seamlessly between sensor inputs and downstream models. Evaluations across multiple neural architectures, benchmark datasets, attack types, and diverse edge devices demonstrate that PatchBlock consistently improves robustness, recovering up to 77% of model accuracy under strong patch attacks such as the Google Adversarial Patch, while maintaining high portability and minimal clean accuracy loss. Additionally, PatchBlock outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses in efficiency, in terms of computation time and energy consumption per sample, making it suitable for EdgeAI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6PatchBlock\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2d\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9002\u5408EdgeAI\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9EdgeAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "PatchBlock\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5757\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u8fbe77%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PatchBlock\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9002\u5408EdgeAI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines.

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6f14\u5458 - \u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08STAC\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408dropout\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5458 - \u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6613\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u4f30\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u56de\u62a5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4e0e\u6f14\u5458\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528dropout\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u60b2\u89c2\u6027\u5c31\u8db3\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165dropout\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "STAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u60b2\u89c2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u548cdropout\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, this cyber-physical convergence introduces new attack surfaces, especially at the interface between computer-aided design (CAD) and machine execution layers. In this work, we investigate targeted cyberattacks on two widely used fused deposition modeling (FDM) systems, Creality's flagship model K1 Max, and Ender 3. Our threat model is a multi-layered Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) intrusion, where the adversary intercepts and manipulates G-code files during upload from the user interface to the printer firmware. The MitM intrusion chain enables several stealthy sabotage scenarios. These attacks remain undetectable by conventional slicer software or runtime interfaces, resulting in structurally defective yet externally plausible printed parts. To counter these stealthy threats, we propose an unsupervised Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes structured machine logs generated during live printing. Our defense mechanism uses a frozen Transformer-based encoder (a BERT variant) to extract semantic representations of system behavior, followed by a contrastively trained projection head that learns anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Later, a clustering-based approach and a self-attention autoencoder are used for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively distinguishes between benign and compromised executions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76FDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u878d\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9FDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2aFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u8d77\u591a\u5c42\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6267\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9FDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity.

This paper contrasts two broad approaches: social constructivist accounts associated with language games, and a mathematically oriented framework we call Semantic Field Theory. Building on earlier work by the author, we formalize the notions of lexical fields (Lexfelder) and linguistic fields (Lingofelder) as interacting structures in a continuous semantic space. We then analyze how core properties of transformer architectures-such as distributed representations, attention mechanisms, and geometric regularities in embedding spaces-relate to these concepts. We argue that the success of LLMs in capturing semantic regularities supports the view that language exhibits an underlying mathematical structure, while their persistent limitations in pragmatic reasoning and context sensitivity are consistent with the importance of social grounding emphasized in philosophical accounts of language use. On this basis, we suggest that mathematical structure and language games can be understood as complementary rather than competing perspectives. The resulting framework clarifies the scope and limits of purely statistical models of language and motivates new directions for theoretically informed AI architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6e38\u620f\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u68c0\u9a8c\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u793e\u4f1a\u5efa\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u573a\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6838\u5fc3\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5f8b\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u54f2\u5b66\u89c2\u70b9\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u800c\u975e\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u660e\u786e\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u660e\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose Defensive M2S, a training paradigm that fine-tunes guardrail models on Multi-turn to Single-turn (M2S) compressed conversations rather than complete dialogue histories. We provide a formal complexity analysis showing that M2S reduces training cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ for $n$-turn conversations. Empirically, on our training dataset (779 samples, avg. 10.6 turns), M2S requires only 169K tokens compared to 15.7M tokens for the multi-turn baseline -- a 93$\\times$ reduction. We evaluate Defensive M2S across three guardrail model families (LlamaGuard, Nemotron, Qwen3Guard) and three compression templates (hyphenize, numberize, pythonize) on SafeDialBench, a comprehensive multi-turn jailbreak benchmark. Our best configuration, Qwen3Guard with hyphenize compression, achieves 93.8% attack detection recall while reducing inference tokens by 94.6% (from 3,231 to 173 tokens per conversation). This represents a 38.9 percentage point improvement over the baseline while dramatically reducing both training and inference costs.

Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows.

The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5411\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7535\u8377\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u7535\u5bb9\u7279\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u53d6\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8bbe\u5907\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5411\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u5907\u67b6\u6784\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7535\u8377\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u8377\u8dc3\u8fc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u9517\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u548c\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5bf9\u6760\u6746\u81c2\u548c\u7535\u5bb9\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u53d6\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u8bbe\u5907\u6709\u7528\u4e14\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

However, existing cuffless wearable devices for blood pressure (BP) monitoring often rely on methods lacking theoretical foundations, such as pulse wave analysis or pulse arrival time, making them vulnerable to physiological and experimental confounders that undermine their accuracy and clinical utility. Here, we developed a smartwatch device with real-time electrical bioimpedance (BioZ) sensing for cuffless hemodynamic monitoring. We elucidate the biophysical relationship between BioZ and BP via a multiscale analytical and computational modeling framework, and identify physiological, anatomical, and experimental parameters that influence the pulsatile BioZ signal at the wrist. A signal-tagged physics-informed neural network incorporating fluid dynamics principles enables calibration-free estimation of BP and radial and axial blood velocity. We successfully tested our approach with healthy individuals at rest and after physical activity including physical and autonomic challenges, and with patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in outpatient and intensive care settings.

The issue shows up when the capacity is tight or the data spans several languages. Such collapse makes it difficult for downstream tasks to build on the resulting representation. Existing compression methods focus on aligning model outputs at a superficial level but fail to preserve the underlying manifold structure. This mismatch often leads to semantic drift in the compact model, causing both task behavior and linguistic properties to deviate from the reference model.\n  To address those issues, we provide a new framework called Embedding Consistency Regulation (ECR). This framework first derives a set of semantic anchors from teacher embeddings (computed once offline). Then, the compact model learns to maintain consistent geometry around these anchors, without relying on matching logits or internal features. ECR adds only a small projection step at inference, without altering the decoding architecture or its runtime behavior.\n  In experiments on a 100K multilingual corpus, ECR consistently stabilizes training and preserves semantic structure across tasks and languages. It also produces a more compact and task-aligned representation space, enabling low-capacity models to learn cleaner manifolds than conventional baselines.

However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic. Beyond empirical designs, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation, proving the convergence of CoCo-Fed even under unsupervised learning conditions suitable for wireless sensing tasks. Extensive simulations on an angle-of-arrival estimation task demonstrate that CoCo-Fed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both memory and communication efficiency while maintaining robust convergence under non-IID settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoCo-Fed\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7ecf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u56de\u4f20\u94fe\u8def\u5e26\u5bbd\u9971\u548c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6CoCo-Fed\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cCoCo-Fed\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u975eIID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "CoCo-Fed\u5728\u89e3\u51b3O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u6027\u597d\u3002"}}

LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\\sim2.5\\times$ less bias and $\\sim$2.2$\\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time.

These tools drive innovation but also enable the spread of misleading content, false information, and manipulated media. As generated images become harder to distinguish from photographs, detecting them has become an urgent priority. To combat this challenge, We release MS COCOAI, a novel dataset for AI generated image detection consisting of 96000 real and synthetic datapoints, built using the MS COCO dataset.

Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability. In contrast, the symbolic reasoning baseline maintains stable detection across both datasets, unaffected by rule rewrites or structural perturbations. These results underscore that LLMs alone are not yet dependable for safety critical interaction-threat detection in IoT environments. We discuss the implications for tool design and highlight the potential of hybrid architectures that combine symbolic analysis with LLM-based semantic interpretation to reduce false positives while maintaining structural rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u89c4\u5219\u4ea4\u4e92\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u8de8\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u89c4\u5219\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u7c7b\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u3001\u4e00\u548c\u4e8c\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u771f\u503c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5355\u72ec\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector.

In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan.

However, solving the governing nonlinear perturbation velocity potential equation presents computational challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on linearized equations or finite, truncated domains, which introduce non-negligible errors and limit applicability in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain. We address the unbounded-domain and convergence challenges inherent in standard PINNs by incorporating a coordinate transformation and embedding physical asymptotic constraints directly into the network architecture.

We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions.

Unlike PKM, FwPKM updates its parameters dynamically at both training and inference time via local chunk-level gradient descent, allowing the model to rapidly memorize and retrieve new key-value pairs from input sequences. Experiments reveal that FwPKM functions as an effective episodic memory that complements the semantic memory of standard modules, yielding significant perplexity reductions on long-context datasets.

NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs.

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift.

To address this challenge, we developed MORE-ML, a computational framework that integrates quantum-mechanical (QM) property data of e-nose molecular building blocks with machine learning (ML) methods to predict sensing-relevant properties. Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs. Leveraging this observation, we defined electronic descriptors of building blocks as inputs for tree-based ML models to predict BFs. Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions. Collectively, MORE-ML combines QM insights with ML to provide mechanistic understanding and rational design principles for molecular receptors in BOV sensing.

Existing multimodal methods fail to leverage this privileged text data when it is unavailable during inference. To bridge this gap, we propose HyperPriv-EPN, a hypergraph-based Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification. This effectively transfers expert knowledge to the preoperative setting, unlocking the value of historical post-operative data to guide the diagnosis of new patients without requiring text at inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHyperPriv - EPN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672f\u540e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u7ba1\u819c\u7624\u672f\u524d\u9884\u540e\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba4\u7ba1\u819c\u7624\u672f\u524d\u9884\u540e\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46MRI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u672f\u540e\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperPriv - EPN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Severed Graph Strategy\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u84b8\u998f\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u56fe\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728311\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cHyperPriv - EPN\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u672f\u524d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6316\u6398\u5386\u53f2\u672f\u540e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u6587\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

Y. Lee, S. Ko, and Y. Hong, Finite Element Operator Network for Solving Elliptic-Type Parametric PDEs, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 47(2), C501-C528, 2025. FEONet realizes the parameter-to-solution map on a finite element space and admits a training procedure that does not require training data, while exhibiting high accuracy and robustness across a broad class of problems. However, its computational cost increases and accuracy may deteriorate as the number of elements grows, posing notable challenges for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a new sparse network architecture motivated by the structure of the finite elements to address this issue. Throughout extensive numerical experiments, we show that the proposed sparse network achieves substantial improvements in computational cost and efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing.
