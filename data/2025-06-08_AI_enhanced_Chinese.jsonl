The procedure follows two steps: First,\nthe elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then,\nthe density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes),\ngiven the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on\nthree independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a\nhigh-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed\nof low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown\nmaterial distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The\nerror between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares\nmanner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the\ntrust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate\ncomputations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are\nprovided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1\ndiscretization is employed when necessary.

We conduct extensive\nevaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and\nadvanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven\nlow-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only\nsurpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse\nretrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves\nSOTA results on several benchmarks.

We showcase the\neffectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk\ncategories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent\nblanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while\nmaintaining topic relevance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSafeSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6210\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u907f\u514d\u5168\u9762\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7b80\u5355\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u7b26\u3002"}}

We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies.

The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance.

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based\nqueries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite\nreflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,\nlocation analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric\nreasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,\nincluding MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The\nbest-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge\nthe gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a\ncomprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200\nrandomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved\nsuperior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best\nradiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI\nperformance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation.

However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

Sharing the global advantage among agents often\nleads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct\ncontributions of agents.

This work analyzes the\nover-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level\nperspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method\ncalled Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates\ncoalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions\nand decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,\nensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA\nemploys random coalition sampling.

Bayesian model comparison provides a principled\nstatistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread\napplication within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian\nevidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore\nincreasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR)\nprovides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two\nnested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR\nrequires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra\nparameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using\nclassical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators,\nhowever, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings.

By integrating\ndata understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables\nmore efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space.

The overhead mainly comes from\nsanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over\nthe past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by\neliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to\nadequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To\naddress this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based\ntechnique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to\nreduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an\nefficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel\nalgorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a\nmemory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation\nusing the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan\nand ASan--, respectively.

For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency\nis required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major\nbottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites\nto ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at\nleast some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.\nIn this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect\nchanges caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite\nimages and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for\ndownlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural\nnetworks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as \"memristors\"\n(nonlinear resistors with memory).

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to\nenable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets.

We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear\nregression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable\ntransitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \\textit{symbolic\ndistance} and \\textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal\nperformance, without forming induction circuits.

Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed\nthrough the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of\nLLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of\nautonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code.

We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

Despite the substantial\nempirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular\nunderstanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on\nreasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been\nhypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)\nproblem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.\nUsing this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,\nproviding models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades\nperformance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit\ngreater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their\nbase counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the\nexecution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow\ninternal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes.

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known\npre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed\ngrokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR\nthrough the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality\nmetric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing\nmetrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by\ntraining for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\\alpha < 2$ and the\nappearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the\nrandomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and\nsignal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual\ninspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using\nKolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including\nactivation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$\nweight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking\nfrom anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and\ngeneralization collapse without direct access to the test data.

In\nthis paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates\ndeep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using\nXGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance\nrobustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU\nincorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)\nand metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to\nassess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017\ndataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six\nevaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.\nWhile transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer\nvision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not\nbeen thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning\nstrategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different\ndataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal\ntransfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining\nthe clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms\ntraditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples\n(approximately 50% of the training data).

In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM\nSelf-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search\nstrategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via\nself-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or\nhardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path\nor explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This\nenables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual\ntuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks.

Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive\nreal-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL\nand MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,\nand 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision\ntakes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic\npost-disaster environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHoAs - PALN\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u81f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u635f\u5931\u5927\uff0c\u53ca\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHoAs - PALN\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u964d\u7ef4\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u535a\u5f08\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408softmax\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5224\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHoAs - PALN\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u6b21\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u95f4\u5c11\u4e8e10\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "HoAs - PALN\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u707e\u540e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u611f\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In Review", "summary": "In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various\nimportant foundation models to predict their properties and performance at\nlarger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and\nsegmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning\nsegmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling\nthe models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual\nrepresentations.

Two independent case studies in melanoma and\nbreast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific\ninsights and support targeted hypothesis generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6cGSA\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u56e0\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff08GSA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGSA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165cGSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u56e0\u7c07\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5bcc\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u8def\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728102\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u6574\u7406\u57fa\u56e0\u96c6\u300119\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u548c10\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0ccGSA\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u9ad830%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "cGSA\u80fd\u589e\u5f3aGSA\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u80cc\u666f\u89c1\u89e3\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9776\u5411\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms.

To asses it, we evaluated ten\nbase models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail\ndatasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under\nvarying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve\nforecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these\ngains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,\naccuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency\nsignificantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for\npoint forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,\nachieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to\naccuracy-optimized combinations.

We find that\nthese images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with\nknown selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual\ncortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the\nbrain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human\nparticipants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive\nactivity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and\nacross subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be\nsuccessfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key\nlimitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,\nour approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses\nacross the human visual system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eDNN\u7684\u4eba\u8111\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8111\u533a\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "DNN\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8111\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u9a71\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Inception V3\u7f51\u7edc\u591a\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bfMRI\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u8111\u7684\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u8fdb\u884cfMRI\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5305\u542b\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9a71\u52a8\u4f4e\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u76ee\u6807\u8111\u533a\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eDNN\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff08HMAR\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff08VAR\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "VAR\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u6539\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u5212\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HMAR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0b\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u6b65\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548IO\u611f\u77e5\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u548c512x512\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHMAR\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eVAR\u3001\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4VAR\u5206\u522b\u5feb2.5\u500d\u548c1.75\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4f4e3\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "HMAR\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VAR\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed\nformulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats\nrepresentation.

Fine-tuning of\nLLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels\nfrom CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)\nin high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =\n{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}).

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as\nWiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that\nenables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different\nbands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network\nthroughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel\nallocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has\npredominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization\nwithin static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses\nthe dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO\ncapabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the\ninherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel\nallocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing\nupper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further\nreduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network\nscenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic\nchannel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into\nthe BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS\nalgorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value.

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

Then, applying this training scheme to multistable\ndynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin\nof attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system\nbehavior in entirely unobserved basins.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6cdb\u5316\u96be\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5c31\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications.

In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics.

In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the\nfish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather\nthan teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving\nthe expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In\nresponse, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.\nlearning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert\noutcomes, even after making a mistake.

The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is\nthe score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising\nobjective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides\nan additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,\nensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an\nenergy network with this \\emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64\ndataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable\nto the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our\nenergy model \\emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are\nnearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local\nneighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with\ntraditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a\nlow-dimensional manifold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728ImageNet64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u6982\u7387\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u56e0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u5f97\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u503c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u5982\u6d4b\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u652f\u6491\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u6982\u7387\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion\nmodel designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging\nfrom operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

However, in Transformer LLMs,\ngeneration cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather\nthan the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time\nhyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within\nthe same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.\nThe success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression\nmethods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load.

This has compelled regulators to impose stringent\ncontrols on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading\nthese controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into\nsmaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve\nmultiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has\nbecome an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have\nfocused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has\nhindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a\nnovel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single\ninterpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction\nnetwork of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,\nGARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection\npower and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML\nworkflows.

During the team\nformation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user\npreferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the\nteam performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for\nsustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and\nalgorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow\nalgorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to\naccount for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving\ngoals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter\nmember dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members\ncommitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence\nof timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and\ninteractions as team dynamics evolve.

Our nonlinear optical models reveal\nremarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The\nnonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining\nsuperior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic\ndissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced\nattractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with\n20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates\nadaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced\ncontrollability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates\nconsistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative\napproaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus\n1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID\nwith exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time\nimproves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework\nenables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical\nphysics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and\nrefractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy.

To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR.

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object\ngeneration and layout generation. While recent generative models have\nsignificantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout\ngeneration remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes.

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPOSSM\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u6709\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0cTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOSSM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u5c16\u5cf0\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7334\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u76ae\u5c42\u5185\u89e3\u7801\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u5199\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0cPOSSM\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684Transformer\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408SSM\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.
