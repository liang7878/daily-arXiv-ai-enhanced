In the literature, there are various types of\nreservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous\nstudies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically\ninspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction\nnetwork as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool\nbased on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed\nmainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited\ntheir current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a\nproper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source\nframework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the\nformer studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework\nfor the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also\naddresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced\ntesting, evaluation, and reproducibility.

The procedure follows two steps: First,\nthe elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then,\nthe density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes),\ngiven the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on\nthree independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a\nhigh-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed\nof low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown\nmaterial distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The\nerror between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares\nmanner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the\ntrust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate\ncomputations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are\nprovided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1\ndiscretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated\nusing refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The\nmethod yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of\nexperimental data is available, even for high measurement noise.

Covering 5,105 stocks from\n2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and\nprovides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short,\nmedium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy;\n(2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a\nfully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6FinMultiTime\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u95fb/\u8868\u683c/K\u7ebf\u56fe/\u4ef7\u683c\u5e8f\u5217\u56db\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u81f3\u5b63\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ec5\u542b\u4ef7\u683c\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5e02\u573a\u4e14\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d6\u6807\u666e500\u548c\u6caa\u6df1300\u6307\u6570\u51715105\u652f\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff082009-2025\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b112.6GB\u91d1\u878d\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u3001K\u7ebf\u56fe\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u949f/\u65e5/\u5b63\u5ea6\u4e09\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1. \u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6 2. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4f7fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u7b49\u589e\u76ca 3. \u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Such an expander topology has logarithmic diameter, high\nexpansion, and is robust to churn and the presence of a large number of bad\nnodes, and facilitates efficient and robust algorithms for fundamental problems\nin distributed computing, such as agreement, broadcasting, routing, etc.\n  Our main contribution is a randomized, fully-distributed dynamic P2P protocol\nthat works with only local initial knowledge and guarantees, with a high\nprobability, the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion\neven under continuous churn and in the presence of a large number of Byzantine\nnodes. Our protocol can tolerate up to $o(n/poly\\log(n))$ Byzantine nodes\n(where $n$ is the stable network size). Our protocol is efficient, lightweight,\nand scalable, and it incurs only $O(poly\\log(n))$ overhead for topology\nmaintenance: only polylogarithmic (in $n$) bits need to be processed and sent\nby each honest node per round, and any honest node's computation cost per round\nis also polylogarithmic.\n  Our protocol can be used as a building block for solving fundamental\ndistributed computing problems in highly dynamic networks, such as Byzantine\nagreement and Byzantine leader election, and enables fast and scalable\nalgorithms for these problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fP2P\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u8282\u70b9\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8282\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3P2P\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u548c\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c40\u90e8\u521d\u59cb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1/\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7ef4\u62a4\u5e38\u6570\u5ea6\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u56fe", "result": "\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcdo(n/poly log n)\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u7ef4\u62a4\u4ec5\u9700O(poly log n)\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6570\u76f4\u5f84\u548c\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}
