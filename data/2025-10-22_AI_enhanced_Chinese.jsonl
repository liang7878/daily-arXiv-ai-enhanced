In this paper we illustrate this approach by\nconsidering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and\nproportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as\nan integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the\nearly exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the\ndividends.

Our theoretical analyses verify the advantages of the proposed DSL-OTA\nalgorithm in terms of fast convergence rate and low communication costs.\nSimulation results reveal that our DSL-OTA outperforms the other existing\nmethods by achieving better learning performance under both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous dataset settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684DSL - OTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u4f20\u8f93\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u590d\u6742\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u662f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684OTA\u6a21\u62df\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5DSL - OTA\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DSL - OTA\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u5728\u540c\u6784\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DSL - OTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

We propose a unified non-convex optimization framework to\nsimultaneously recover a sequence of graph Laplacian matrices while\nreconstructing the unobserved signal entries. Unlike conventional decoupled\nmethods, our integrated approach facilitates a bidirectional flow of\ninformation between the graph and signal domains, yielding superior robustness,\nparticularly in high missing-data regimes. To capture realistic network\ndynamics, we introduce a fused-lasso type regularizer on the sequence of\nLaplacians. This penalty promotes temporal smoothness by penalizing large\nsuccessive changes, thereby preventing spurious variations induced by noise\nwhile still permitting gradual topological evolution. For solving the joint\noptimization problem, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which leverages the problem's structure to yield\nclosed-form solutions for both the graph and signal subproblems. This design\nensures scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. On the\ntheoretical front, despite the inherent non-convexity, we establish a\nconvergence guarantee, proving that the proposed ADMM scheme converges to a\nstationary point. Furthermore, we derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees,\nproviding high-probability error bounds for the graph estimator as a function\nof sample size, signal smoothness, and the intrinsic temporal variability of\nthe graph.

The web application presented in this paper, named\n\"instaGuide\", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews\nfrom a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the\nreviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an\neffort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria.\n  During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were\nevaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest\nthat the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the\nusers need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment,\nimproving the overall decision-making procedure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u77ed\u79df\u516c\u5bd3\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1instaGuide\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u8282\u7701\u7528\u6237\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8ba2\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4f\u89c8\u4f4f\u5bbf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u5f0f\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u540d\u4e3ainstaGuide\u7684Web\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6Booking.com\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u623f\u4ea7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u8bba\u3001\u5408\u6210\u8bc4\u8bba\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u623f\u4ea7\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6458\u8981\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u641c\u7d22\u5408\u9002\u77ed\u79df\u516c\u5bd3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6574\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u6316\u6398\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u77ed\u79df\u516c\u5bd3\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

A common\napproach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual\noutcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective\nvalue. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy\nhas better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy\nevaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy\noptimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual\nimprovements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by\ndownstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nstrategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy\noptimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream.\nSpecifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also\nfor the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than\nthe observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize\nthe Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals.\nBased on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that\nuses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in\nthese predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can\nselect the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy\nevaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform\nsimulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u5b9e\u9645\u652f\u6491\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u8d62\u5bb6\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u548c\u6bd4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u7b56\u7565\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8d62\u5bb6\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a\nvoice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for\nBengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural\nhandbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the\ncontent; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic\nretrieval.

In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced\nhigh-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop\nmanagement, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the\nKisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on\na 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual\nrichness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable\nrelevance and technical specificity.

This is especially true for pointer analysis, where, unless\nsignificant compromises are made in the precision of the analysis, there is a\ncombinatorial blowup of information. One of the key problems we observed in our\nown efforts is that a lot of duplicate data was being propagated, and many\nlow-level data structure operations were repeated a large number of times.\n  We present what we consider to be a novel and generic data structure,\nLatticeHashForest (LHF), to store and operate on such information in a manner\nthat eliminates a majority of redundant computations and duplicate data in\nscenarios similar to those encountered in compilers and program optimization.\nLHF differs from similar work in this vein, such as hash-consing, ZDDs, and\nBDDs, by not only providing a way to efficiently operate on large, aggregate\nstructures, but also modifying the elements of such structures in a manner that\nthey can be deduplicated immediately. LHF also provides a way to perform a\nnested construction of elements such that they can be deduplicated at multiple\nlevels, cutting down the need for additional, nested computations.\n  We provide a detailed structural description, along with an abstract model of\nthis data structure. An entire C++ implementation of LHF is provided as an\nartifact along with evaluations of LHF using examples and benchmark programs.\nWe also supply API documentation and a user manual for users to make\nindependent applications of LHF.

We introduce\napproximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\\Lambda$CDM comoving\ndistance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and\n0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\\Omega_{\\rm m} \\in [0.1, 0.5]$.\nWe show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like\n$3\\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those\nobtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer\nsubstantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their\npractical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Conventional DRA approaches require reliable\ncommunication, yet real-world networks frequently suffer from link failures,\npacket drops, and communication delays due to environmental conditions, network\ncongestion, and security threats.\n  We introduce a novel resilient DRA algorithm that addresses these critical\nchallenges, and our main contributions are as follows: (1) guaranteed\nconstraint feasibility at all times, ensuring resource-demand balance even\nduring algorithm termination or network disruption; (2) robust convergence\ndespite sector-bound nonlinearities at nodes/links, accommodating practical\nconstraints like quantization and saturation; and (3) optimal performance under\nmerely uniformly-connected networks, eliminating the need for continuous\nconnectivity.\n  Unlike existing approaches that require persistent network connectivity and\nprovide only asymptotic feasibility, our graph-theoretic solution leverages\nnetwork percolation theory to maintain performance during intermittent\ndisconnections. This makes it particularly valuable for mobile multi-agent\nsystems where nodes frequently move out of communication range. Theoretical\nanalysis and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm converges to optimal\nsolutions despite heterogeneous time delays and substantial link failures,\nsignificantly advancing the reliability of distributed resource allocation in\npractical network environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff08DRA\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u3001\u4e22\u5305\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u6e17\u6d41\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u94fe\u8def\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Our evaluation\nacross three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection,\nmalicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that\nBlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety\nprompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks,\nBlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false\npositives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative,\nmisclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average\n12.7\\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to\nits ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware\nrisk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming\nby continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa BlueCodeAgent \u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u84dd\u961f\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea2\u961f\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747 F1 \u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347 12.7%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u4fa7\u91cd\u7ea2\u961f\uff0c\u84dd\u961f\u8fdb\u5c55\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u533a\u5206\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa BlueCodeAgent \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7ea2\u961f\u548c\u84dd\u961f\uff0c\u7ea2\u961f\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u84dd\u961f\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5baa\u6cd5\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747 F1 \u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347 12.7%\uff0c\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ea2\u961f\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u84dd\u961f\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key\ncomponents: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,\nand hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths.

The abundance of\nunresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While\nregression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is\npreserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose:\ndebugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance\nthe generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2)\nvalidate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present\nTestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and\nstrategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch\nvalidation.\n  A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the\nregression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the\npredominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential\nas large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate\ninference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline\nand orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show\nthat TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction\nrate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue\nresolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench\nVerified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but\nnot submitted as final patches.

To study this, we design an experimental setup\nusing the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We\nintroduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture\nthe consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We\ndistinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former\nimplies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of\nerrors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence\nwith the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the\nRL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without\nnecessarily producing valid or correct solutions.

The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update\nconverges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes.

Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow\nmatching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image\ngeneration, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline\nmethods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.\nADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B\nand 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style\ntransfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.\nADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and\nmulti-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.\nIn LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local\noptima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it\noutperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model\nto outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro\nand GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the\nexploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and\nmodalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faADRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5f31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ADRPO\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6837\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6837\u672c\u52a0\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f7f2B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9003\u9038\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aGRPO\u3002", "conclusion": "ADRPO\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u63a2\u7d22 - \u5229\u7528\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$.

Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size.

The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform\ncomparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through\nempirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this\nstructured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and\nreduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u52a0\u6743\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u5feb\u901f\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u53f0\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\u3001UI/UX \u5b9a\u5236\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u3001AI \u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e73\u53f0\u9501\u5b9a\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u5f53\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u586b\u8865\u8425\u9500\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Theoretical results establish the\nequivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be\nderived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or\nDueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we\nconsider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the\nexpected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the\ndestination within a given time budget.

In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead.

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We\nvalidate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and\nconstraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance\nmatching or exceeding unfiltered baselines.

In this paper,\nwe introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic\nannotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to\nreplace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges:\nextracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain\ntransaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations.

We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones.

Existing methods typically\nassume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,\nwhich is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert\nannotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet\nunder-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).\nDNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and\ninter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address\nthe DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first\nestimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences\nvia a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,\nRULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute\nfusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during\ninter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE\nfurther incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the\nunderlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more\naccurate equivalent entity identification.

TCCM is inspired by flow\nmatching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields\nbetween probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to\ndiffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly\napplying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea\n-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the\nframework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed\ntarget (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key\nadvantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the\nneed for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;\n(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which\nquantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward\npass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models\nsuch as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy\nbut heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as\nthe learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly\nscore inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is\nLipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical\nguarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench\nbenchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy\nand inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on\nhigh-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the\nclosed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label\nspaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world\nscenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in\nthe source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised\nopen-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly\nclassify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously\nunseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel\nframework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and\nmodel sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph\nstructure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and\nunknown classes.

However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient\nexploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical\nbottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation\nmethod that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance\nmechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels.

In the modeling\nphase, multiple architectures and fine-tuning strategies were explored, and\nhyperparameters optimized using curated validation sets to balance performance\nacross query-category (QC) and query-item (QI) tasks. The proposed framework\nexhibited robustness and adaptability across languages and domains,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of systematic data curation and iterative\nevaluation for multilingual search systems.

In this paper, we investigate the security\nimplications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,\nwe show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our\nkey insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose\ntrigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this\nunderestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new\nbackdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of\ntransferable backdoors.

Specifically, we evaluate the\nperformance of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs such as TinyLLaMA,\nFalcon-RW-1B, and Flan-T5 by prompting them to generate plausible passwords\nbased on structured user attributes (e.g., name, birthdate, hobbies).

To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss\nfunction is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,\nmeteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the\nuncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our\nmethod surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop\nyield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to\n0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support\nfor industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient\nagriculture in times of changing climate conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u89e3\u51b3\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u519c\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u7cae\u98df\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u7f3a\u6c34\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u7269\u5e72\u65f1\u80c1\u8feb\u548c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u6c34\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4ea7\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aLSTM\u548cTransformers\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe0.82\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u548c\u519c\u6c11\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on\ncomparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal\nthat there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)\nsignificant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive\nrunning time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM.

Recent data-driven methods based\non deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but\nstruggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error\naccumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling\nacross space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive\napproaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of\nfuture latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond\ninitial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic\nmethods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale\nacross accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics.

Recently, a\nsignificant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference\ntechniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that\nunsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,\ninvolving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.\nIn this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost\nimpossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical\ninconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack\ngrounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence\nof tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome\nthese issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its\ncontext in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting\nindustrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors\nfor specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a\nrole in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we\naim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby\nreducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and\ntrustworthiness.

However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty.

Topics such as cultural\ncontext, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the\nspatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter\ncontinues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of\nbiases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical\nresponsibilities in model development.

Our framework is\nan elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models\n(TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the\noriginal setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined\nby a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\\Omega$. We introduce\n$j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by\nKripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving\nmorphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule\nsystem whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal\nIntuitionistic logic of the causal topos.

The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a\nsparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only\nidentifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual\ninterpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.\nThis paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that\nmatch token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the\nlikelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of\ncounting rules.

Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic\nediting of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in\nGANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of\nattributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view\nconsistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face.

A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)\nwith external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge\nstored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two\ncategories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning\non externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),\nwhich depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual\ndocuments. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation.

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores.

The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static\nset of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse\nrewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with\ninefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these\ndistinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically\ncombines RL with teacher-guided distillation.

Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac\ngene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal\nsignificance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate\nrequiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954).

A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance.

However, their limited representational\ncapacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial\nimagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that\ncan effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images\nwhile reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D\nmentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on\nexplicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of\ntwo stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent\ngenerated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,\nVGGT).

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning.
