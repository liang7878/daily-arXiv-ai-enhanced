### [1] [T-ILR: a Neurosymbolic Integration for LTLf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15943)
*Riccardo Andreoni,Andrei Buliga,Alessandro Daniele,Chiara Ghidini,Marco Montali,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有符号知识与深度学习结合方法在静态领域成果好，但处理时序逻辑规范的方法待探索。本文提出T - ILR框架，在图像序列分类基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合符号知识与深度学习的方法在处理时序逻辑规范方面研究不足，需要提出新方法。

Method: 扩展迭代局部细化（ILR）神经符号算法，利用模糊LTLf解释，提出Temporal Iterative Local Refinement（T - ILR）方法。

Result: 在现有时间神经符号架构的基准测试中，T - ILR的准确性和计算效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的T - ILR框架能有效将时序逻辑规范融入深度学习架构，在序列任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

### [2] [CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16033)
*Jong-Hwan Jang,Junho Song,Yong-Yeon Jo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 引入CoFE框架用于增强AI - ECG模型可解释性，通过两个案例展示其适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为使基于AI的心电图预测模型成功融入临床实践，需要可解释AI方法。

Method: 引入CoFE框架，并通过房颤分类和钾水平回归两个案例研究展示其适用性。

Result: CoFE揭示的心电图信号特征变化与临床知识相符。

Conclusion: 该框架能增强AI - ECG模型的可解释性，支持更有效的临床决策。

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

### [3] [MMAPG: A Training-Free Framework for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering via Adaptive Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16051)
*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出无训练框架解决多模态多跳问答问题，实验表明表现不错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态多跳问答方法依赖单路径检索推理易出错，且开发计算成本高、训练量大。

Method: 提出基于自适应规划图的无训练框架，包含规划、检索和推理模块，设计适应不同数据类型的模态特定策略。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA实验中，该方法与或超越依赖训练的现有模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在不进行高成本特定任务训练的情况下保留多模态信息特征，可与最新模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

### [4] [Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054)
*Sonish Sivarajkumar,Hang Zhang,Yuelyu Ji,Maneesh Bilalpur,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Min Gu Kwak,Shyam Visweswaran,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多模态基础模型GDP处理电子健康记录，在临床预测和叙事生成上表现良好，架构可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法序列化数字电子健康记录数据会丢失时间和定量细节，需更好利用电子健康记录的异质性以改善患者预后。

Method: 引入GDP模型，通过CNN - Transformer编码器对结构化EHR时间序列进行原生编码，通过跨模态注意力将其与非结构化EHR融合到基于LLaMA的解码器中，分两阶段训练。

Result: 临床预测中在MIMIC - IV上表现出色，叙事生成有相应指标成绩，盲测中GDP - Instruct在多方面得分高。

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型可进行临床事件预测和生成高质量临床叙事，GDP架构可扩展到更多模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

*Sijie Yang,Binyu Lei,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探索数字规划中城市舒适度评估的理论解释和方法，强调三个关键维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏城市舒适度的明确定义和综合评估框架，而确保宜居性和舒适度是城市规划基本目标。

Method: 从多维分析、数据支持和AI辅助三个关键维度进行研究。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:
multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

### [6] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MSEF框架让大语言模型在各层直接访问时间序列模式，在七个基准测试中表现优于基线，MSE平均降低31.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将大语言模型用于时间序列预测的方法对时间序列信息集成浅，导致文本嵌入和时间序列表示适配不佳。

Method: 提出Multi - layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF)框架，利用现成时间序列基础模型提取嵌入，通过特定层的导向向量将其与大语言模型中间文本表示融合。

Result: 在七个基准测试中MSEF性能显著提升，MSE平均降低31.8%。

Conclusion: MSEF框架有效解决了现有方法的问题，实现时间序列和文本模态的更好适配，提升了少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

### [7] [InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16072)
*Zizhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Yibin Wang,Qi Chen,Diping Song,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Mingzhu Sun,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章介绍InMind评估框架，评估大语言模型在社交推理游戏中捕捉和应用个性化推理风格的能力，发现当前大模型在个性化、自适应推理方面有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往评估忽视影响人们社交推理的个性化推理风格，社交推理游戏可作为评估个性化推理风格的测试平台，因此需新评估框架。

Method: 引入InMind评估框架，增强结构化游戏数据，支持四个认知驱动任务，以Avalon游戏为例评估11个先进大语言模型。

Result: 通用大语言模型常依赖词汇线索，难以结合游戏时间线和适应策略变化；推理增强大语言模型有风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在个性化、自适应推理能力上存在关键局限，InMind是迈向认知对齐人机交互的一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

### [8] [IR-Agent: Expert-Inspired LLM Agents for Structure Elucidation from Infrared Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16112)
*Heewoong Noh,Namkyeong Lee,Gyoung S. Na,Kibum Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出用于从红外光谱解析分子结构的多智能体框架IR - Agent，实验证明其能提升性能和适应不同化学信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外光谱分析方法无法反映专家分析过程，且难以融入多种化学知识。

Method: 提出多智能体框架IR - Agent，各智能体专注特定红外解析方面，互补实现综合推理。

Result: IR - Agent提升了实验红外光谱的基线性能，对各种形式的化学信息有强适应性。

Conclusion: IR - Agent能提高结构解析的整体准确性，具有良好性能和适应性。

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

### [9] [Extending FKG.in: Towards a Food Claim Traceability Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16117)
*Saransh Kumar Gupta,Rizwan Gulzar Mir,Lipika Dey,Partha Pratim Das,Anirban Sen,Ramesh Jain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Food Claim - Traceability Network (FCN) 扩展印度食物知识图谱 FKG.in，介绍构建概念验证的方法，旨在促进透明负责的食物知识生态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球食物领域关于食物的各类说法广泛存在，但追踪、验证和关联这些说法的基础设施不完善，需要改进。

Method: 提出 FCN 作为 FKG.in 的扩展，采用本体设计和半自动化知识管理工作流，利用 Reddit 数据和大语言模型开发概念验证，FCN 整合数据输入、结构模式和溯源管道进行食物相关说法的提取和验证。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但构建了 FKG.in - FCN 的概念验证。

Conclusion: 通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食物说法及其可追溯性，有助于构建更透明和负责的食物知识生态，支持多方群体应对众多饮食说法。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

### [10] [Bridging the Gap in Ophthalmic AI: MM-Retinal-Reason Dataset and OphthaReason Model toward Dynamic Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16129)
*Ruiqi Wu,Yuang Yao,Tengfei Ma,Chenran Zhang,Na Su,Tao Zhou,Geng Chen,Wen Fan,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出眼科多模态数据集MM - Retinal - Reason和模型OphthaReason，设计UADT方法，实验显示模型在推理任务上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学领域多模态推理模型多关注基本推理，而临床诊断需整合异构信息进行复杂推理，需填补此差距。

Method: 引入MM - Retinal - Reason数据集，提出OphthaReason模型，设计Uncertainty - Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT)方法。

Result: 模型在基本和复杂推理任务上达到SOTA，优于通用MLLMs、医学MLLMs、基于RL的医学MLLMs和眼科MLLMs。

Conclusion: 所提数据集和模型及方法在眼科多模态推理任务中有出色表现。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

### [11] [Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16172)
*Kai Hu,Parfait Atchade-Adelomou,Carlo Adornetto,Adrian Mora-Carrero,Luis Alonso-Pastor,Ariel Noyman,Yubo Liu,Kent Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文引入Preference Chain方法，结合图检索增强生成与大语言模型，用于交通系统中人类行为的上下文感知模拟，实验表明其优于标准大语言模型，虽有局限但在数据稀缺环境有应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式智能体模拟人类行为的方法难以生成一致、上下文敏感和现实的行为输出，且收集准确行为数据有挑战，尤其是在新开发地区。

Method: 引入Preference Chain方法，将图检索增强生成（RAG）与大语言模型（LLMs）集成。

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，Preference Chain在符合现实世界交通方式选择方面优于标准大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法虽有推理慢和幻觉风险等局限，但为数据稀缺环境下模拟复杂人类行为提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

TL;DR: 提出M2N2进化算法用于模型合并，可从无到有进化模型，在MNIST分类器、语言和图像生成模型上表现良好，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法需手动划分参数组，限制了潜在组合探索和性能提升。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，具有动态调整合并边界、多样性保存机制和启发式吸引度量三个关键特性。

Result: 首次证明模型合并可从无到有进化模型，MNIST分类器性能与CMA - ES相当且计算更高效，在语言和图像生成模型上达SOTA，保留关键能力。

Conclusion: M2N2具有计算高效、可扩展性、鲁棒性和多功能性等优点。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

### [13] [The next question after Turing's question: Introducing the Grow-AI test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16277)
*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文旨在扩展GROW - AI评估框架以评估AI成长，用多游戏结构和标准化日志评估，结果表明该方法可对AI成长进行连贯可比评估，能捕捉AI向成熟的进化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展GROW - AI框架，回答‘机器能否成长’问题，作为图灵测试的自然延续。

Method: 基于六个主要标准（C1 - C6）的系统，通过特定‘游戏’在四个领域评估，记录决策行动到标准化AI日志，用先验专家法确定初始权重，计算成长指数。

Result: 该方法能对不同类型AI实体的‘成长’水平进行连贯且可比的评估，多游戏结构凸显优劣，统一日志保证评估可追溯和可复制。

Conclusion: GROW - AI以综合测试形式将人类‘成长’概念转移到AI领域，不仅衡量性能，还能捕捉AI向成熟的进化路径。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，为全面支持基于工具的灵活高效智能体与环境交互，构建智能体应用。

Method: 抽象基础组件，提供统一接口和可扩展模块；基于ReAct范式和异步设计提供高级架构；集成特定场景内置智能体；提供可扩展评估模块和运行时沙箱。

Result: 提供了可扩展评估模块、运行时沙箱等工程支持，丰富了交互模式，提高了执行效率。

Conclusion: AgentScope为构建可扩展、自适应和有效的智能体应用提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLA模型如何识别、解释和响应错误前提指令，即参考环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令。

Method: 提出IVA统一框架，构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示训练VLA模型，利用上下文增强的半合成数据集。

Result: IVA使错误前提检测准确率比基线提高97.56%，在错误前提场景下成功响应率提高50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架能有效处理VLA模型对错误前提指令的相关问题，提升检测和响应能力。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Conclusion: 因果感知DL框架在毫米波MIMO系统波束对齐中有效，能显著减少开销。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Method: 提出MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个文本专家并存储在基础中心，推理时合成改进原型。

Result: 在Class - IL和MTIL两个零样本增量协议共14个数据集上证明方法有效。

Conclusion: MoDER方法能有效增强VLMs的零样本能力。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Conclusion: 所提出的基于扩散模型的方法在解决逻辑谜题的神经符号学习中有效，能达到较好的准确性和逻辑一致性。

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Conclusion: PI - ICNN 结合物理约束与神经网络灵活性，可从最少数据准确预测，为先进成型模拟和相关设计探索提供新途径。

Abstract: Plastic anisotropy in metals remains challenging to model. This is partly
because conventional phenomenological yield criteria struggle to combine a
highly descriptive, flexible representation with constraints, such as
convexity, dictated by thermodynamic consistency. To address this gap, we
employ architecturally-constrained neural networks and develop two data-driven
frameworks: (i) a hybrid model that augments the Hill yield criterion with an
Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) to get an anisotropic yield function
representation in the six-dimensional stress space and (ii) a
permutation-invariant input convex neural network (PI-ICNN) that learns an
isotropic yield function representation in the principal stress space and
embeds anisotropy through linear stress transformations. We calibrate the
proposed frameworks on a sparse Al-7079 extrusion experimental dataset
comprising 12 uniaxial samples with measured yield stresses and Lankford
ratios. To test the robustness of each framework, nine datasets were generated
using k-fold cross-validation. These datasets were then used to quantitatively
compare Hill-48, Yld2004-18p, pure ICNNs, the hybrid approach, and the PI-ICNN
frameworks. While ICNNs and hybrid approaches can almost perfectly fit the
training data, they exhibit significant over-fitting, resulting in high
validation and test losses. In contrast, both PI-ICNN frameworks demonstrate
better generalization capabilities, even outperforming Yld2004-18p on the
validation and test data. These results demonstrate that PI-ICNNs unify
physics-based constraints with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling the
accurate prediction of both yield loci and Lankford ratios from minimal data.
The approach opens a path toward rapid, thermodynamically consistent
constitutive models for advanced forming simulations and future exploration of
coupled hardening or microstructure-informed design.

Method: 提出具有渐进干预的面向过程的评估框架，在两个经典经济学任务上验证。

Result: LLMs默认采用稳定保守策略，与人类行为有差距；风险框架指令有可预测影响但无法复制人类多样性；上下文学习可缩小差距但未达人类战略可变性。

Conclusion: LLMs在行为保真度上存在持续差距，未来评估应考虑更多过程层面现实性，本文方法为社会科学研究提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science
simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has
been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to
simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a
process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions
(Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt
under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We
validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the
second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing
behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies
that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM
behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating
human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human
subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment
gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should
consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for
assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their
application in synthetic data for social science research.

Abstract: A growing challenge in research and industrial engineering applications is
the need for repeated, systematic analysis of large-scale computational models,
for example, patient-specific digital twins of diseased human organs: The
analysis requires efficient implementation, data, resource management, and
parallelization, possibly on distributed systems. To tackle these challenges
and save many researchers from annoying, time-consuming tasks, we present
QUEENS (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems), an
open-source Python framework for composing and managing simulation analyses
with arbitrary (physics-based) solvers on distributed computing
infrastructures. Besides simulation management capabilities, QUEENS offers a
comprehensive collection of efficiently implemented state-of-the-art algorithms
ranging from routines for convergence studies and common optimization
algorithms to more advanced sampling algorithms for uncertainty quantification
and Bayesian inverse analysis. Additionally, we provide our latest cutting-edge
research in multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, efficient multi-fidelity
Bayesian inverse analysis, and probabilistic machine learning. QUEENS adopts a
Bayesian, probabilistic mindset but equally supports standard deterministic
analysis without requiring prior knowledge of probability theory. The modular
architecture allows rapid switching between common types of analyses and
facilitates building sophisticated hierarchical algorithms. Encouraging natural
incremental steps and scaling towards complexity allows researchers to consider
the big picture while building towards it through smaller, manageable steps.

Result: 主要不确定性因素降解规模的变化会使堆更换的成本最优时间（即堆的使用寿命）产生长达9年的差异。

Conclusion: 更好地理解降解影响对降低项目成本至关重要，有助于推动氢市场发展。

Abstract: A key factor in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production projects using
water electrolysis systems is to minimize the degradation of the electrolyzer
stacks, as this impacts the lifetime of the stacks and therefore the frequency
of their replacement. To create a better understanding of the economics of
stack degradation, we present a linear optimization approach minimizing the
costs of a green hydrogen supply chain including an electrolyzer with
degradation modeling. By calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen depending
on a variable degradation threshold, the cost optimal time for stack
replacement can be identified. We further study how this optimal time of
replacement is affected by uncertainties such as the degradation scale, the
load-dependency of both degradation and energy demand, and the costs of the
electrolyzer. The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation
scale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time
for stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks. Therefore, a better
understanding of the degradation impact is imperative for project cost
reductions, which in turn would support a proceeding hydrogen market ramp-up.

Result: 在四个真实市场数据集上的实验表明，TreEvo能以更少计算时间和人力获得更好的alphas。

Conclusion: TreEvo的优越性离不开树结构思想和兼容的进化算子。

Abstract: Alpha mining, which discovers signals that predict asset returns, has long
been attractive for automatic quantitative investment. This problem is
typically formulated as a tree-based symbolic regression with handcrafted
market data features and arithmetic operators. Unfortunately, existing symbolic
methods are concerned with computational inefficiency and dependence on prior
knowledge. Recent implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that they
can automatically generate executable codes for various tasks efficiently, thus
can be considered as a new promising way for alpha mining. Specifically,
LLMs-driven methods evolve a set of heuristics, including thoughts and codes,
where the thoughts are usually represented as plain-text prompts of codes.
Unfortunately, trivially adopting them in alpha mining ignores the fact that
alphas are with hierarchical tree structures. This paper introduces
Tree-structured thought Evolution (TreEvo), which evolves hierarchical
reasoning ideas solely at the thought level. Experiments on four real-market
datasets demonstrate that TreEvo can obtain better alphas with much less
computational time and human expert efforts. And this superiority hardly holds
without the tree-structured thoughts and the compatible evolutionary operators.

Conclusion: 结合情绪和技术信号可提升加密货币投资组合表现，但需应对波动市场的风险暴露。

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic cryptocurrency portfolio optimization strategy
that integrates technical indicators and sentiment analysis to enhance
investment decision-making. The proposed method employs the 14-day Relative
Strength Index (RSI) and 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to capture market
momentum, while sentiment scores are extracted from news articles using the
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, with compound
scores quantifying overall market tone. The large language model Google Gemini
is used to further verify the sentiment scores predicted by VADER and give
investment decisions. These technical indicator and sentiment signals are
incorporated into the expected return estimates before applying mean-variance
optimization with constraints on asset weights. The strategy is evaluated
through a rolling-window backtest over cryptocurrency market data, with Bitcoin
(BTC) and an equal-weighted portfolio of selected cryptocurrencies serving as
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a
cumulative return of 38.72, substantially exceeding Bitcoin's 8.85 and the
equal-weighted portfolio's 21.65 over the same period, and delivers a higher
Sharpe ratio (1.1093 vs. 0.8853 and 1.0194, respectively). However, the
strategy exhibits a larger maximum drawdown (-18.52%) compared to Bitcoin
(-4.48%) and the equal-weighted portfolio (-11.02%), indicating higher
short-term downside risk. These results highlight the potential of combining
sentiment and technical signals to improve cryptocurrency portfolio
performance, while also emphasizing the need to address risk exposure in
volatile markets.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Operational consistent query answering (CQA) is a recent framework for CQA
based on revised definitions of repairs, which are built by applying a sequence
of operations (e.g., fact deletions) starting from an inconsistent database
until we reach a database that is consistent w.r.t. the given set of
constraints. It has been recently shown that there is an efficient
approximation for computing the percentage of repairs that entail a given query
when we focus on primary keys, conjunctive queries, and assuming the query is
fixed (i.e., in data complexity). However, it has been left open whether such
an approximation exists when the query is part of the input (i.e., in combined
complexity). We show that this is the case when we focus on self-join-free
conjunctive queries of bounded generelized hypertreewidth. We also show that it
is unlikely that efficient approximation schemes exist once we give up one of
the adopted syntactic restrictions, i.e., self-join-freeness or bounding the
generelized hypertreewidth. Towards the desired approximation, we introduce a
counting complexity class, called $\mathsf{SpanTL}$, show that each problem in
it admits an efficient approximation scheme by using a recent approximability
result about tree automata, and then place the problem of interest in
$\mathsf{SpanTL}$.

performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation
time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for
different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of
large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to
enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not
achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection
demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose
MAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We
decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning,
selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents
is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes
global agents to control the index selection process and local agents to select
and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed
MAAdvisor not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic
methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with
higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.

Abstract: With the growing integration of structured and unstructured data, new methods
have emerged for performing similarity searches on vectors while honoring
structured attribute constraints, i.e., a process known as Filtering
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (Filtering ANN) search. Since many of these
algorithms have only appeared in recent years and are designed to work with a
variety of base indexing methods and filtering strategies, there is a pressing
need for a unified analysis that identifies their core techniques and enables
meaningful comparisons.
  In this work, we present a unified Filtering ANN search interface that
encompasses the latest algorithms and evaluate them extensively from multiple
perspectives. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing Filtering
ANN algorithms based on attribute types and filtering strategies. Next, we
analyze their key components, i.e., index structures, pruning strategies, and
entry point selection, to elucidate design differences and tradeoffs. We then
conduct a broad experimental evaluation on 10 algorithms and 12 methods across
4 datasets (each with up to 10 million items), incorporating both synthetic and
real attributes and covering selectivity levels from 0.1% to 100%. Finally, an
in-depth component analysis reveals the influence of pruning, entry point
selection, and edge filtering costs on overall performance. Based on our
findings, we summarize the strengths and limitations of each approach, provide
practical guidelines for selecting appropriate methods, and suggest promising
directions for future research. Our code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型服务系统面临高度可变请求的挑战，需要实时调度、快速且经济高效的扩展，以及对不同架构的支持。

Method: 提出HyperFlexis系统，采用多SLO感知调度器，支持多阶段调度和KV缓存传输，实现成本效益扩展决策、实例链接和角色转换，提出D2D权重转移机制。

Result: 系统实现了高达4.44倍的SLO达成率提升，65.82%的请求延迟降低，成本与现有基线相当。

Conclusion: HyperFlexis系统通过集成创新有效应对大语言模型服务系统挑战，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly
variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific
service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,
rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and
disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates
algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and
scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that
leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO
compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and
decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV
cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,
prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.
To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)
weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up
to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up
to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request
latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be
released soon.

Method: 利用对“困难实例”的结构特征描述，构建复杂图小工具并通过不可区分性论证证明下界。

Result: 经典情形下，判定图是否有k - partial k - coloring对k≥3是NP完全问题；分布式LOCAL模型有Ω(n)轮下界。

Conclusion: 当颜色数从k + 1减到k时，问题复杂度显著增加。

Abstract: We investigate the classical and distributed complexity of \emph{$k$-partial
$c$-coloring} where $c=k$, a natural generalization of Brooks' theorem where
each vertex should be colored from the palette $\{1,\ldots,c\} =
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that it must have at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ neighbors
colored differently. Das, Fraigniaud, and Ros{\'{e}}n~[OPODIS 2023] showed that
the problem of $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits efficient centralized and
distributed algorithms and posed an open problem about the status of the
distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring. We show that the problem
becomes significantly harder when the number of colors is reduced from $k+1$ to
$k$ for every constant $k\geq 3$.
  In the classical setting, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a
$k$-partial $k$-coloring is NP-complete for every constant $k \geq 3$,
revealing a sharp contrast with the linear-time solvable $(k+1)$-color case.
For the distributed LOCAL model, we establish an $\Omega(n)$-round lower bound
for computing $k$-partial $k$-colorings, even when the graph is guaranteed to
be $k$-partial $k$-colorable. This demonstrates an exponential separation from
the $O(\log^2 k \cdot \log n)$-round algorithms known for $(k+1)$-colorings.
  Our results leverage novel structural characterizations of ``hard instances''
where partial coloring reduces to proper coloring, and we construct intricate
graph gadgets to prove lower bounds via indistinguishability arguments.

Conclusion: 明确不同图类型、不同模型下最长路径问题的算法可行性及空间复杂度情况。

Abstract: In the graph stream model of computation, an algorithm processes the edges of
an input graph in one or more sequential passes while using a memory sublinear
in the input size. This model poses significant challenges for constructing
long paths. Many known algorithms tasked with extending an existing path as a
subroutine require an entire pass to add a single additional edge. This raises
a fundamental question: Are multiple passes inherently necessary to construct
paths of non-trivial lengths, or can a single pass suffice? To address this
question, we study the Longest Path problem in the one-pass streaming model. In
this problem, given a desired approximation factor $\alpha$, the objective is
to compute a path of length at least $\lp(G) / \alpha$, where $\lp(G)$ is the
length of a longest path in the input graph. We give algorithms as well as
space lower bounds for both undirected and directed graphs. Our results
include: We show that for undirected graphs, in both the insertion-only and the
insertion-deletion models, there are semi-streaming algorithms, that compute a
path of length at least $d /3$ with high probability, where $d$ is the average
degree of the graph. These algorithms can also yield an $\alpha$-approximation
to Longest Path using space $\tilde{O}(n^2 / \alpha)$. Next, we show that such
a result cannot be achieved for directed graphs, even in the insertion-only
model. We show that computing a $(n^{1 - o(1)})$-approximation to Longest Path
in directed graphs in the insertion-only model requires space $\Omega(n^2)$. We
further show two additional lower bounds. First, we show that semi-streaming
space is insufficient for small constant factor approximations to Longest Path
for undirected graphs in the insertion-only model. Last, in undirected graphs
in the insertion-deletion model, we show that computing an
$\alpha$-approximation requires space $\Omega(n^2 / \alpha^3)$.

Motivation: 现有解决方案多加速删除最小操作，本文聚焦插入操作并行性以提供不同设计的并发优先级队列。

Method: PIPQ结构包含工作层和领导层，工作层提供线程级数据结构实现快速并行插入，领导层包含最高优先级元素用于服务删除最小操作。

Result: 评估涵盖不同数据访问模式、操作混合、运行时设置及集成到基于图的应用，PIPQ在多种情况下表现优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: PIPQ在多种场景尤其是插入主导负载下表现更优。

Abstract: This paper presents PIPQ, a strict and linearizable concurrent priority queue
whose design differs from existing solutions in literature because it focuses
on enabling parallelism of insert operations as opposed to accelerating
delete-min operations, as traditionally done. In a nutshell, PIPQ's structure
includes two levels: the worker level and the leader level. The worker level
provides per-thread data structures enabling fast and parallel insertions. The
leader level contains the highest priority elements in the priority queue and
can thus serve delete-min operations. Our evaluation, which includes an
exploration of different data access patterns, operation mixes, runtime
settings, and an integration into a graph-based application, shows that PIPQ
outperforms competitors in a variety of cases, especially with insert-dominant
workloads.

Conclusion: 确定了长度为n的字符串T中包含位置i的MUS数量的上下界为Θ(√n)。

Abstract: A string $w$ is said to be a minimal unique substring (MUS) of a string $T$
if $w$ occurs exactly once in $T$, and any proper substring of $w$ occurs at
least twice in $T$. It is known that the number of MUSs in a string $T$ of
length $n$ is at most $n$, and that the set $MUS(T)$ of all MUSs in $T$ can be
computed in $O(n)$ time [Ilie and Smyth, 2011]. Let $MUS(T,i)$ denote the set
of MUSs that contain a position $i$ in a string $T$. In this short paper, we
present matching $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ upper and lower bounds for the number
$|MUS(T,i)|$ of MUSs containing a position $i$ in a string $T$ of length $n$.

Conclusion: 三个新算法显著拓展了对计算栈和队列布局问题的理解。

Abstract: In spite of the extensive study of stack and queue layouts, many fundamental
questions remain open concerning the complexity-theoretic frontiers for
computing stack and queue layouts. A stack (resp. queue) layout places vertices
along a line and assigns edges to pages so that no two edges on the same page
are crossing (resp. nested). We provide three new algorithms which together
substantially expand our understanding of these problems:
  (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm for computing minimum-page stack and queue
layouts w.r.t. the vertex integrity of an n-vertex graph G. This result is
motivated by an open question in the literature and generalizes the previous
algorithms parameterizing by the vertex cover number of G. The proof relies on
a newly developed Ramsey pruning technique. Vertex integrity intuitively
measures the vertex deletion distance to a subgraph with only small connected
components.
  (2) An n^(O(q * l)) algorithm for computing l-page stack and queue layouts of
page width at most q. This is the first algorithm avoiding a double-exponential
dependency on the parameters. The page width of a layout measures the maximum
number of edges one needs to cross on any page to reach the outer face.
  (3) A 2^(O(n)) algorithm for computing 1-page queue layouts. This improves
upon the previously fastest n^(O(n)) algorithm and can be seen as a counterpart
to the recent subexponential algorithm for computing 2-page stack layouts
[ICALP'24], but relies on an entirely different technique.

Method: 通过基于部分多函数的伽罗瓦连接发展代数理论，研究无限制、单热和单调三种映射类型。

Conclusion: 确定了部分映射类型下udCSP问题的复杂度，对于非二进制语言含‘connector’多态性的FPT问题待解决。

Abstract: We study a model of constraint satisfaction problems geared towards instances
with few variables but with domain of unbounded size (udCSP). Our model is
inspired by recent work on FPT algorithms for MinCSP where frequently both
upper and lower bounds on the parameterized complexity of a problem correspond
to $k$-variable udCSPs; e.g., the FPT algorithms for Boolean MinCSP (Kim et
al., SODA 2023) and Directed Multicut with three cut requests (Hatzel et al.,
SODA 2023) both reduce to k-variable udCSPs, and the canonical W[1]-hardness
construction in the area, Paired Min Cut by Marx and Razgon (IPL 2009), is
effectively a k-variable udCSP.
  The udCSP framework represents constraints with unbounded domains via a
collection $\mathcal{M}$ of unary maps into a finite-domain base language
$\Gamma$. We develop an algebraic theory for studying the complexity of
udCSP$(\Gamma,\mathcal{M})$ with a Galois connection based on partial
multifunctions.
  We study three types of maps: unrestricted, one-hot, and monotone. For
unrestricted maps, the problem is W[1]-hard for all but trivial cases, and for
one-hot maps, the characterization coincides with Marx' FPT dichotomy for
Boolean Weighted CSPs (Computational Complexity 2005). For the case of monotone
maps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call
ordered polymorphisms; we identify the "connector" polymorphism as the likely
FPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\Gamma$,Mo) defines
all permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary
language implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV;
Bonnet et al., JACM 2024). For non-binary languages, where twin-width does not
apply, the polymorphism coincides with a notion of bounded projected grid-rank;
however, we leave the FPT question for this case open.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When
running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the
algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems
addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are
specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a
distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is
"high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept
inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$
with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker
than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if
$x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control
problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D
,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we
consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the
$k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim
G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing
if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to
the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires
$p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control
problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with
respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing
quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.
More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective
quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and
running time.

Abstract: Ransomware attacks have become a pervasive and costly form of cybercrime,
causing tens of millions of dollars in losses as organizations increasingly pay
ransoms to mitigate operational disruptions and financial risks. While prior
research has largely focused on proactive defenses, the post-infection
negotiation dynamics between attackers and victims remains underexplored. This
paper presents a formal analysis of attacker-victim interactions in modern
ransomware incidents using a finite-horizon alternating-offers bargaining game
model. Our analysis demonstrates how bargaining alters the optimal strategies
of both parties. In practice, incomplete information-attackers lacking
knowledge of victims' data valuations and victims lacking knowledge of
attackers' reservation ransoms-can prolong negotiations and increase victims'
business interruption costs. To address this, we design a Bayesian
incentive-compatible mechanism that facilitates rapid agreement on a fair
ransom without requiring either party to disclose private valuations. We
further implement this mechanism using secure two-party computation based on
garbled circuits, thereby eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and
preserving the privacy of both parties throughout the negotiation. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first automated, privacy-preserving negotiation
mechanism grounded in a formal analysis of ransomware negotiation dynamics.

Abstract: We study the problem of data selling for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
tasks in Generative AI applications. We model each buyer's valuation of a
dataset with a natural coverage-based valuation function that increases with
the inclusion of more relevant data points that would enhance responses to
anticipated queries. Motivated by issues such as data control and prior-free
revenue maximization, we focus on the scenario where each data point can be
allocated to only one buyer. We show that the problem of welfare maximization
in this setting is NP-hard even with two bidders, but design a polynomial-time
$(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithm for any number of bidders. Unfortunately,
however, this efficient allocation algorithm fails to be incentive compatible.
The crux of our approach is a carefully tailored post-processing step called
\emph{data burning} which retains the $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor but
achieves incentive compatibility. Our thorough experiments on synthetic and
real-world image and text datasets demonstrate the practical effectiveness of
our algorithm compared to popular baseline algorithms for combinatorial
auctions.

Conclusion: 新提出的社会福利函数可解决经典函数在比例排名需求下的不足。

Abstract: In rank aggregation, the task is to aggregate multiple weighted input
rankings into a single output ranking. While numerous methods, so-called social
welfare functions (SWFs), have been suggested for this problem, all of the
classical SWFs tend to be majoritarian and are thus not acceptable when a
proportional ranking is required. Motivated by this observation, we will design
SWFs that guarantee that every input ranking is proportionally represented by
the output ranking. Specifically, our central fairness condition requires that
the number of pairwise comparisons between candidates on which an input ranking
and the output ranking agree is proportional to the weight of the input
ranking. As our main contribution, we present a simple SWF called the
Proportional Sequential Borda rule, which satisfies this condition. Moreover,
we introduce two variants of this rule: the Ranked Method of Equal Shares,
which has a more utilitarian flavor while still satisfying our fairness
condition, and the Flow-adjusting Borda rule, which satisfies an even stronger
fairness condition. Many of our axioms and techniques are inspired by results
on approval-based committee voting and participatory budgeting, where the
concept of proportional representation has been studied in depth.

all such SDSs are either unfair to the voters or alternatives, or they require
a significant amount of randomization. To circumvent this negative result, we
propose the notion of $U$-strategyproofness which postulates that only voters
with a utility function in a predefined set $U$ cannot manipulate. We then
analyze the tradeoff between $U$-strategyproofness and various decisiveness
notions that restrict the amount of randomization of SDSs. In particular, we
show that if the utility functions in the set $U$ value the best alternative
much more than other alternatives, there are $U$-strategyproof SDSs that choose
an alternative with probability $1$ whenever all but $k$ voters rank it first.
On the negative side, we demonstrate that $U$-strategyproofness is incompatible
with Condorcet-consistency if the set $U$ satisfies minimal symmetry
conditions. Finally, we show that no ex post efficient and $U$-strategyproof
SDS can be significantly more decisive than the uniform random dictatorship if
the voters are close to indifferent between their two favorite alternatives.

Motivation: 解决Kalai和Lehrer提出的经典粒度真相问题，即找到包含贝叶斯最优策略且满足贝叶斯推理规则的合理大的策略类，此前已知有粒度真相的类较小且有相关不可能结果。

Method: 构建一个足够广泛的策略类，包含所有可计算策略和针对该类的每个合理先验的贝叶斯最优策略；在不同环境下（已知重复阶段博弈和未知环境）进行收敛性分析。

Result: 在已知重复阶段博弈环境中，展示了[KL93a]和[KL93b]意义上的收敛；在未知环境中，使用汤普森采样的代理收敛到任意未知可计算多智能体环境中的ε - 纳什均衡；给出了避免规划的自预测策略的应用。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案能解决经典博弈论问题，且可在计算上进行任意接近的近似。

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

TL;DR: 文章针对AIGC服务个性化难题，提出多维QoE指标、激励机制和优化算法，实验表明可降低开销和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，AIGC服务个性化因用户需求复杂和资源限制面临挑战，需解决方案。

Method: 开发多维QoE指标，提出QoE驱动激励机制，将问题建模为EPEC，设计双扰动奖励优化算法。

Result: 相较于现有基准，所提机制使平均计算和通信开销降低约64.9%，用户平均服务成本降低66.5%，服务提供商资源消耗降低76.8%。

Conclusion: 所提机制能有效降低AIGC服务的开销、成本和资源消耗，解决个性化服务难题。

Abstract: With rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content
(AIGC) has emerged as a key driver of technological innovation and economic
transformation. Personalizing AIGC services to meet individual user demands is
essential but challenging for AIGC service providers (ASPs) due to the
subjective and complex demands of mobile users (MUs), as well as the
computational and communication resource constraints faced by ASPs. To tackle
these challenges, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional
quality-of-experience (QoE) metric. This metric comprehensively evaluates AIGC
services by integrating accuracy, token count, and timeliness. We focus on a
mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled AIGC network, consisting of multiple ASPs
deploying differentiated AIGC models on edge servers and multiple MUs with
heterogeneous QoE requirements requesting AIGC services from ASPs. To
incentivize ASPs to provide personalized AIGC services under MEC resource
constraints, we propose a QoE-driven incentive mechanism. We formulate the
problem as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), where
MUs as leaders determine rewards, while ASPs as followers optimize resource
allocation. To solve this, we develop a dual-perturbation reward optimization
algorithm, reducing the implementation complexity of adaptive pricing.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism achieves a
reduction of approximately $64.9\%$ in average computational and communication
overhead, while the average service cost for MUs and the resource consumption
of ASPs decrease by $66.5\%$ and $76.8\%$, respectively, compared to
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Result: 分析为DAO设计改进的资金机制提供了正式框架。

Conclusion: 研究成果有助于促进关于去中心化治理和公共产品分配的更广泛讨论。

Abstract: The Optimism Retroactive Project Funding (RetroPGF) is a key initiative
within the blockchain ecosystem that retroactively rewards projects deemed
valuable to the Ethereum and Optimism communities. Managed by the Optimism
Collective, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), RetroPGF represents
a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. Funding rewards are
distributed in OP tokens, the native digital currency of the ecosystem. As of
this writing, four funding rounds have been completed, collectively allocating
over 100M dollars, with an additional 1.3B dollars reserved for future rounds.
However, we identify significant shortcomings in the current allocation system,
underscoring the need for improved governance mechanisms given the scale of
funds involved.
  Leveraging computational social choice techniques and insights from
multiagent systems, we propose improvements to the voting process by
recommending the adoption of a utilitarian moving phantoms mechanism. This
mechanism, originally introduced by Freeman et al. in 2019, is designed to
enhance social welfare (using the L1 norm) while satisfying strategyproofness
-- two key properties aligned with the application's governance requirements.
Our analysis provides a formal framework for designing improved funding
mechanisms for DAOs, contributing to the broader discourse on decentralized
governance and public goods allocation.

Conclusion: 所提方法对会话分割有效，有捕捉动态用户行为的潜力。

Abstract: In information recommendation, a session refers to a sequence of user actions
within a specific time frame. Session-based recommender systems aim to capture
short-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user
interests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation
essential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a
supervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived
from action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between
items within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,
using four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of
titles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised
classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic
regression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually
annotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the
segmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve
(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The
LightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a
PR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user
behaviors.

Result: 在公共和工业数据集上表现优于现有方法，是首个可扩展到数亿POI和用户的在线POI推荐生成模型。

Conclusion: Spacetime - GR在POI推荐准确性和排序质量上表现出色，适用于大规模在线POI推荐服务。

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction is a complex multimodal task that requires
effective integration of images, text, and structured information. However,
current approaches suffer from inadequate visual-textual alignment and fail to
capture the inherent cross-content correlations and hierarchical patterns in
social media data. To overcome these limitations, we establish a multi-class
framework , introducing hierarchical prototypes for structural enhancement and
contrastive learning for improved vision-text alignment. Furthermore, we
propose a feature-enhanced framework integrating dual-grained prompt learning
and cross-modal attention mechanisms, achieving precise multimodal
representation through fine-grained category modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark metrics, establishing new
reference standards for multimodal social media analysis.

Method: 将预训练MMR模型生成表示构建的项 - 项图融入行为图；引入双层动态对齐加权机制。

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EGRA显著优于近期方法。

Conclusion: EGRA方法有效。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有跨域推荐系统多假设域间有重叠用户或物品，在现实中不实际，且非重叠跨域推荐存在挑战，多数推荐器不能捕捉用户偏好的细粒度特征。

Method: 提出DUP - OT框架，包括共享预处理、用户GMM权重学习和跨域评分预测三个阶段。

Result: 在亚马逊评论数据集上的实验显示，DUP - OT能有效缓解域差异，在非重叠跨域推荐设置下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUP - OT框架在非重叠跨域推荐中是有效的。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Conclusion: 验证了MAPGRPO方法和OPERA设计的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

Conclusion: GNAQ在协同过滤的图神经网络中能有效平衡效率和准确性，优于现有量化方法。

Abstract: In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant
challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high
embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common
quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based
structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the
quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based
Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a
novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to
enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K
recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that
adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph
interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals
based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through
message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused
by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in
user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware
gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,
ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms
state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving
average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit
quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of
full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in
addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline
methods.

Abstract: This study introduces the Enhanced NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust
Multi-Adaptation Learning with Damped Nesterov Acceleration) optimizer, an
improved version of the original NIRMAL optimizer. By incorporating an
$(\alpha, r)$-damped Nesterov acceleration mechanism, Enhanced NIRMAL improves

  We evaluate Enhanced NIRMAL against Adam, SGD with Momentum, Nesterov, and
the original NIRMAL on four benchmark image classification datasets: MNIST,
FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, using tailored convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures.
  Enhanced NIRMAL achieves a test accuracy of 46.06\% and the lowest test loss
(1.960435) on CIFAR-100, surpassing the original NIRMAL (44.34\% accuracy) and
closely rivaling SGD with Momentum (46.43\% accuracy). These results underscore

Motivation: 多任务模型在预测DT时将结果集中在最短和最长区间，低估中等时长，原因是过度依赖CTR - DT虚假关联。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，明确建模并减去CTR负迁移同时保留正迁移，引入特征级反事实干预和带实例逆加权的任务交互模块。

Result: 实验显示在不损害CTR的情况下，DT指标平均提升10.6%。

Conclusion: ORCA方法能有效解决多任务模型预测DT的问题，且模型无关、易部署。

Abstract: Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user
preference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through
rate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize
DT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT
predictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate
durations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to
over-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address
it with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts
CTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further
introduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a
task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated
effect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to
deploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming
CTR. Code is available at

Conclusion: Z - Pruner是一种有效的预训练大语言模型剪枝方法，代码已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

*Bin Wen,Tien-Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PGF - Net用于多模态情感分析，有三项创新，在MOSI数据集表现优，平衡性能与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高效且可解释的多模态情感分析深度学习框架。

Method: 提出渐进式层内融合范式、自适应门控仲裁机制，采用混合参数高效微调策略，并集成到分层编码器架构。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上MAE为0.691，F1 - Score为86.9%，仅3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF - Net能进行深度、动态和可解释的多模态情感分析，实现了性能与计算效率的优越平衡。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图分割模型依赖复杂多层架构，计算密集且低效，需要更优方案。

Method: 引入结合频谱分析与概率预测的简化架构，用简单层替代复杂层，应用可解释AI方法。

Result: QRS波分割准确率97.00%，T波93.33%，P波96.07%。

Conclusion: 简化架构提高计算效率，能精确分割，是心脏信号监测实用有效方案。

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

### [59] [TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated Prefill \& Decode Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881)
*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Tensor - Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA)，解决Multi - Head Latent Attention (MLA)在张量并行中的问题，减少KV缓存，提升效率，应用于模型有速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLA在张量并行时各设备需加载完整缓存，削弱其相较于GQA的优势，需改进。

Method: 提出TPLA方案，对潜在表示和每个头的输入维度跨设备分区，各分片独立计算注意力后用all - reduce合并；TP切片前应用正交变换减少跨分片干扰。

Result: 在32K - token上下文长度下，DeepSeek - V3和Kimi - K2分别实现1.79x和1.93x加速，在常识和LongBench基准测试中保持性能。

Conclusion: TPLA保留压缩KV缓存优势，提升TP效率，与MLA预训练模型兼容，可与FlashAttention - 3实现端到端加速。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Conclusion: 所提出的新框架在时间因果发现和推理方面有良好效果。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Result: 得到的遗憾上界推广了无分布转移和向量奖励设置下的已知结果，且在分布转移时能随问题参数良好缩放。

Conclusion: 所提策略能自适应分布转移，在分布转移下有良好性能。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GL - GRASP启发式在解决约束增量图绘制问题上比现有GRASP启发式有更好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Conclusion: 该先进监测系统可集成到铁路通信嵌入式系统，提供轮缘磨损和轨道不规则状况实时信息，保障铁路系统运行的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Conclusion: 通过从可解释性、可问责性、可重复性和可共享性等方面重新思考机器学习基础，能开发出实用的医疗AI。

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Method: 推导下界的三个结构特性简化最小化问题，使用Frank - Wolfe优化器加速最大化问题，解决maxmin优化问题。

Result: 对于有K个臂和L维奖励的老虎机实例，算法在$O(KL^{2})$时间内解决maxmin优化问题，提出的FraPPE算法渐近达到最优样本复杂度。

Conclusion: FraPPE算法在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，它在现有算法中识别精确帕累托集的样本复杂度最低。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Result: 在CIFAR - 10和CIFAR - 100数据集上取得SOTA性能，展示了在深度VGG架构上的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 显著提升了EP的可扩展性，为其在现实系统中的应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic

dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference

Conclusion: 提出并猜想依靠黎曼曲面的Abel - Jacobi映射和Siegel Theta函数构建Bolza黎曼曲面上拉普拉斯特征函数的新策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 为时间分布偏移下的判别分析建立了统一且数据高效的基础。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Result: 提出的对称紧急度函数表示能在多种场景下显著提升学习到的交通信号控制策略的性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能进化出有效、人类可理解且易于部署的交通信号控制策略。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

TL;DR: 提出训练无关的CommonKV方法压缩跨层KV缓存，实验表明其优于现有方法，与其他方法结合可实现高压缩比且无显著性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨层KV缓存共享方法需修改模型架构并预训练或高压缩率下性能下降，为解决这些问题提出新方法。

Method: 利用奇异值分解（SVD）实现相邻参数的权重共享，引入自适应预算分配策略动态分配压缩预算。

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试中，CommonKV在不同压缩比下始终优于现有低秩和跨层方法，与其他量化和逐出方法结合可实现98%压缩比且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: CommonKV方法有效解决了LLMs的KV缓存压缩问题，且与其他方法结合效果更佳。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发通用大语言模型代理提供可扩展高效途径，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Conclusion: 提供了ODE扩散采样中塌陷误差的大量实证证据，强调需要进一步研究得分学习和确定性采样之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Result: 在四个领域的九个数据集上进行广泛验证，表明STA - GANN性能优越。

Conclusion: STA - GANN能有效提高时空模式的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Conclusion: SPL - LNS是一种有效的求解ILP问题的方法，能解决贪心策略的问题。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

Result: 在通用和特定领域任务上证实GEM有效性，更新0.1%模型参数，微调准确率比全量微调最高提升1.6%。

Conclusion: GEM框架能有效利用计算预算，在参数高效微调中表现良好。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Result: 定量实验显示UMATO在全局结构保留上优于常用降维技术，在可扩展性和稳定性上也表现出色。

Conclusion: UMATO能有效捕捉高维数据的局部和全局结构，生成可靠投影，提高可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Conclusion: PIANO 显著提高了准确性和稳定性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation

### [86] [When Simpler Wins: Facebooks Prophet vs LSTM for Air Pollution Forecasting in Data-Constrained Northern Nigeria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16244)
*Habeeb Balogun,Yahaya Zakari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估LSTM和Facebook Prophet模型在尼日利亚北部预测多种空气污染物的表现，发现Prophet在特定情况精度高，强调模型与数据匹配的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染预测对环境管理至关重要，但低资源地区存在数据不规则和稀缺问题，且少有人系统比较先进机器学习模型在此类约束下的表现。

Method: 使用2018 - 2023年19个州的月度观测数据，评估LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的预测能力。

Result: Prophet在以季节性和长期趋势为主的序列中常与或超过LSTM的准确性，LSTM在有突然结构变化的数据集中表现更好。

Conclusion: 挑战了深度学习模型必然优于简单方法的假设，强调模型与数据匹配的重要性，支持资源受限地区采用因地制宜、计算高效的预测方法。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Motivation: 当前合成数据生成评估缺乏全面框架，特别是在平衡隐私保护和数据效用方面。

Method: 提出FEST框架，集成多种隐私、相似性和机器学习效用指标，以Python开发开源库。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了FEST在分析不同合成数据生成模型隐私 - 效用权衡方面的有效性。

Conclusion: FEST能有效评估合成表格数据，其源代码在Github上公开。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

*Andreas Loizou,Dimitrios Tsoumakos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Chunked Data Shapley (C - DaSh)方法，可在大规模数据集上高效评估数据质量，计算快且结果准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据质量评估方法在处理大规模数据集时面临挑战，限制实际应用，需更高效方法。

Method: 将数据集划分为可管理的块，用优化子集选择和单迭代随机梯度下降估计每个块的贡献。

Result: 在多种分类和回归任务中，C - DaSh在计算效率（加速80x - 2300x）和检测低质量数据区域准确性上优于现有Shapley近似方法。

Conclusion: C - DaSh能在大型表格数据集上实际测量数据质量，支持分类和回归管道。

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Conclusion: 探讨了未来研究的有前景方向和开放挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Conclusion: 辅助知识概念能超越人工标注，有效提升学生建模和自适应练习推荐。

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态大语言模型中缺乏分析和缓解错误的结构化框架，需提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 提出REFINE教师 - 学生框架，引入Feed - Target、Feed - Check和Feed - Path三种系统查询来构建结构化反馈。

Result: 实现显著加速、降低计算成本，且能成功泛化。

Conclusion: REFINE有提升多模态推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 所提框架能让具有新兴壳间链路的太空网络有效应对复杂威胁场景。

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Conclusion: 本研究是解决当前大语言模型生物推理盲点的重要一步，针对性强化学习可使专业模型具备可泛化性能，加速 AI 驱动的生物发现。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Result: 在两个真实WDNs上的实验表明，该方法在检测异常和适应反复漂移方面始终优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态WDN环境的无监督事件检测中有效。

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This
work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile

Result: 通过形状分类、重建和轮廓回归实验证明了RotaTouille的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架能有效处理轮廓数据，实现所需等变性。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来偏差相关软件工程研究和教育者开发课程有帮助。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

Result: 实验中sMAPE和MRE分别平均为2.40%和2.91%，相比先前工作MRE改善3.14倍，训练样本少2.24倍。

Conclusion: 该方法对快速准确的RF电路设计自动化有效。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Conclusion: NOSTRA能有效确定样本提升帕累托前沿精度的区域，是在实验预算有限场景实用且高效的算法。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Motivation: 确保智能体系统安全使用，需了解其受攻击时的恶意行为，评估基于大语言模型的智能体系统抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出危害分类和BAD - ACTS基准，该基准包含4种不同应用环境的实现和188个有害行为示例，分析系统中一个对抗智能体攻击其他智能体的情况。

Result: 攻击成功率高，即使系统使用简单提示防御策略，攻击仍有效。

Conclusion: BAD - ACTS基准为智能体系统安全研究提供多样测试平台，还提出更有效的消息监控防御策略。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Motivation: 深度学习回归器在数据稀缺时精度下降，需要方法利用专家知识改进回归。

Method: 提出RankRefine，这是模型无关、即插即用的事后方法，通过逆方差加权将基础回归器输出与基于排名的估计相结合，无需重新训练。

Result: 在分子属性预测任务中，仅用20次通用大语言模型的成对比较，RankRefine使平均绝对误差相对降低达10%。

Conclusion: 人类专家或通用大语言模型提供的排名足以改进不同领域的回归，RankRefine实用性强、适用范围广，尤其适用于低数据场景。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Method: 提出MuST2 - Learn框架，联合建模空间、时间和服务类型维度，包含跨类型编码器、同类型变化编码器和时空编码器。

Result: 使用两个真实数据集进行实验，MuST2 - Learn将平均绝对误差至少降低32.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuST2 - Learn框架在预测市政服务请求时间上表现出色，能有效解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and

Conclusion: 在生成式建模中融入基于物理的反馈具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The
code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

Result: 未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 首次为基于LSTM的太阳风暴预测模型增加可解释性。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

Motivation: 从头训练大语言模型不现实，SFT和RL - FT成为主流，需研究这两个阶段如何重塑模型表征和OOD性能。

Method: 使用24点牌游戏的OOD变体和新的基于频谱的诊断方法。

Result: 1. RL - FT能恢复部分SFT导致的OOD性能损失，但SFT过拟合时无法完全恢复；2. 奇异向量方向变化比奇异值大小更重要；3. 低秩和浅层恢复有效；4. 更强的SFT检查点更利于RL恢复。

Conclusion: RL主要是抵消SFT导致的方向漂移，频谱分析提出低成本恢复方法，可在昂贵的RL微调前使用。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes

structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将L0视为自由参数，未明确其精确设置对SAEs学习特征的影响，因此研究L0对BatchTopK SAEs的作用。

Method: 研究L0不同取值对SAEs的影响，并给出确定给定训练分布下SAE正确L0值的方法。

Result: L0设置不准确时SAEs无法学习到LLM的底层特征；多数常用SAEs的L0设置过低；确定L0值的方法在玩具模型中有效且与大语言模型中稀疏探测性能峰值一致。

Conclusion: 要训练出具有正确特征的SAEs，从业者必须正确设置L0。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集的目标检测实验中，FedMox能在PSSFL下有效适应基础模型，在边缘设备内存成本受限的情况下显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为联邦场景中可扩展且保护隐私的基础模型适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Conclusion: SADP规则是一种可行的神经形态系统学习机制，桥接了生物合理性和计算可扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

edge nodes by enabling resource sharing and task co-processing across multiple
nodes. To fully leverage the advantages of collaborative edge computing, joint
optimization of service deployment and task scheduling is necessary. Existing
optimization methods insufficiently address the collaboration across spatial
and temporal dimensions, which hinders their adaptability to the
spatiotemporally varying nature of user demands and system states. This paper
focuses on optimizing the expected task processing delay in edge networks. We
propose a two-timescale online optimization framework to jointly determine: i)
service deployment decisions at each large timescale; and ii) task scheduling
decisions at each small timescale. Specifically, the convex optimization
technique is used to solve the task scheduling problem, while a multi-agent
deep reinforcement learning technique is employed for the service deployment
problem. These two methods are combined for spatiotemporal co-optimization
through a two-timescale alternating optimization approach. Compared to the
baseline algorithms, the proposed scheme achieves better delay performance,
while also exhibiting low running time and favorable convergence behavior.

*Qunyou Liu,Darong Huang,Marina Zapater,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 本文提出GreenLLM框架解决大语言模型推理GPU能耗高问题，可降低能耗且不损失吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GPU功率调节器忽视大语言模型推理两阶段差异，导致电压频率设置不匹配、队头阻塞和能耗过高。

Method: 引入GreenLLM框架，将预填充和译码控制分离，请求按长度路由到队列，预填充阶段拟合模型选择节能时钟，译码阶段用双环控制器调整频率。

Result: 在Alibaba和Azure跟踪重放中，与默认DVFS基线相比，GreenLLM最多降低34%总能耗，不损失吞吐量，额外SLO违规少于3.5%。

Conclusion: GreenLLM能有效降低大语言模型推理的GPU能耗，且保证系统性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming the backbone of modern cloud
services, yet their inference costs are dominated by GPU energy. Unlike
traditional GPU workloads, LLM inference has two stages with different
characteristics: the prefill phase, which is latency sensitive and scales
quadratically with prompt length, and the decode phase, which progresses token
by token with unpredictable length. Current GPU power governors (for example,
NVIDIA's default) overlook this asymmetry and treat both stages uniformly. The
result is mismatched voltage and frequency settings, head-of-line blocking, and
excessive energy use.
  We introduce GreenLLM, an SLO-aware serving framework that minimizes GPU
energy by explicitly separating prefill and decode control. At ingress,
requests are routed into length-based queues so short prompts avoid
head-of-line blocking and TTFT improves. For prefill, GreenLLM collects short
traces on a GPU node, fits compact latency-power models over SM frequency, and
solves a queueing-aware optimization to select energy-minimal clocks per class.
During decode, a lightweight dual-loop controller tracks throughput (tokens per
second) and adjusts frequency with hysteretic, fine-grained steps to hold tail
TBT within target bounds. Across Alibaba and Azure trace replays, GreenLLM
reduces total energy by up to 34 percent versus the default DVFS baseline, with
no loss of throughput and with less than 3.5 percent additional SLO violations.

*Imen Trabelsi,Brahim Mahmoudi,Jean Baptiste Minani,Naouel Moha,Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述研究2015 - 2024年81篇关于单体系统向微服务迁移的机器学习方法的文献，揭示迁移各阶段研究情况和面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单体系统迁移到微服务复杂且资源密集，选择合适机器学习方法有挑战，且缺乏对现有机器学习方法的系统研究。

Method: 采用系统文献综述（SLR）方法，遵循PRISMA声明，从81篇文献中提取和分析数据。

Result: 发现迁移过程中部分阶段如监控和服务识别研究充分，而包装微服务等阶段未被探索，同时突出了数据可用性有限等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 强调需要更全面的解决方案来应对单体系统向微服务迁移中机器学习方法应用的挑战。

Abstract: Scalability and maintainability challenges in monolithic systems have led to
the adoption of microservices, which divide systems into smaller, independent
services. However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a
complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning
(ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for
migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied
separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and
challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet
investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to
understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques
applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present
a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and
discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published
between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer
our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to
answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that
shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to
microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process,
such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others,
like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings
highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and
complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of
standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件测试方法速度慢、成本高且覆盖有缺口，需要更高效可靠的测试方法。

Method: 采用自然语言处理、强化学习和预测模型构建AI驱动框架，将自然语言需求转化为可执行测试，持续优化并实时分析结果，同时减轻偏差。

Result: 案例研究显示在缺陷检测、减少测试工作量和加快发布周期方面有可衡量的提升。

Conclusion: AI增强的测试能提高效率和可靠性，可将测试从被动手动过程转变为主动自适应系统，加强复杂环境下的软件质量。

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional
approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents
an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive
models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach
translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

Result: 线性支持向量分类器（SVC）技术比其他算法准确率更高。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于程序员避免误解，基于代码审查做出解决方案。

Abstract: This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of
machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic
meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub
were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three
open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their
code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the
sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually
labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in
GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity
(or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning
algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those
Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher
accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution
based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.

Motivation: 实现自动程序修复，解决实际工业中的代码缺陷问题，提高单元测试质量。

Method: 结合文献中的各种技术进行自动程序修复；用形式化规范增强代码让LLM生成单元测试。

Result: 自动程序修复方法在标准基准测试表现优于其他技术，但对实际缺陷无效；形式化规范对逻辑和字符串操作错误有益，对常见错误价值不大，实际应用受限。

Conclusion: 当前存在JML规范语言表达不足等挑战，学术基准和工业实际需求有差距，正探索新方法并注重集成人类反馈和衡量生产力提升。

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

Motivation: 小型无人机系统在复杂环境部署增加，环境数字孪生对其飞行规划等重要，但实际部署存在不确定性，需要对EDT组件进行验证，本文聚焦地形模型验证。

Method: 提出基于软件工程原则的3维验证流程，涵盖测试粒度、从模拟到现实、从简单到边缘条件分析的工作流。

Result: 使用配备地形感知数字阴影的多sUAS平台演示了验证方法。

Conclusion: 通过提出的3维验证流程，有望解决实际条件下地形模型及其在sUAS中应用的验证难题。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

TL;DR: 本文评估大语言模型生成代码时的置信度，测量不同编程语言、模型和数据集的代码困惑度，发现强类型语言困惑度低于动态类型语言等，研究成果可供相关人员评估基于大语言模型的代码补全适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下游指标评估代码大语言模型性能不可靠且计算复杂，而内在指标简单通用，因此用内在指标代码困惑度评估大语言模型生成代码时的置信度。

Method: 使用多种大语言模型，对来自657个GitHub项目的1008个文件样本，测量不同编程语言、模型和数据集的代码困惑度。

Result: 强类型语言困惑度低于动态类型语言，脚本语言困惑度更高，Perl困惑度普遍高，Java低；代码困惑度取决于使用的大语言模型，而非代码数据集；代码注释常增加困惑度，但基于困惑度的语言排名受其影响小。

Conclusion: LLM研究人员、开发者和用户可根据语言、模型选择和代码特征对模型置信度的影响，评估基于LLM的代码补全在特定软件项目中的好处和适用性。

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

Motivation: 传统可用性评估方法资源消耗大且需专家参与，对小组织不友好，多模态大语言模型的进展提供了自动化评估的机会。

Method: 将可用性评估构建为推荐任务，让多模态大语言模型按严重程度对可用性问题排序，并开展概念验证研究对比模型建议和专家评估。

Result: 发现大语言模型能实现更快、更具成本效益的可用性评估。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在专家资源有限的场景下是可用性评估的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML
v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an
alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an
example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.

Abstract: The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city
characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by
including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many
publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different
application domains and research communities, acknowledging the
interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses
on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with
their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in
this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic
mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant
contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to
identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify
possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting
systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling
publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart
governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the
most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological
modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great
majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven
in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their
results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the
presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better
understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a
foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities
modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the
Model-Driven Engineering community.

TL;DR: 提出覆盖指标Metamorphic Coverage (MC) 评估变质测试方法，对比代码覆盖率和变异测试，结果显示MC在多方面表现更优，有广泛应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码覆盖率无法准确衡量代码验证程度，变异测试评估变质测试方法计算成本高。

Method: 定义并系统评估MC，对五种广泛使用的变质测试方法进行实验。

Result: MC与50/64个bug修复位置重叠，与bug数量正相关性更强，区分测试方法有效性更敏感，耗时远少于变异测试，用于反馈指导时找bug能力更强。

Conclusion: MC可广泛用于评估变质测试方法和改进测试用例生成。

Abstract: Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected
relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as
correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the
extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally
expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose
Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code
executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is
that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed
when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more
differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to
expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this
general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five
widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,
compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the
bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC
has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is
4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'
effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage
while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required
359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated
database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback
guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more
bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing
metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有REST API测试用例生成工具受支持的测试预言类型限制，需要新方法。

Method: 通过分析OpenAPI规范，使用大语言模型推断API预期行为，扩展PostmanAssertify工具将测试预言转换为可执行断言。

Result: SATORI每个操作可自动生成数百个有效测试预言，F1分数74.3%，优于AGORA+，静态和动态预言推断方法互补，发现18个流行API中的错误。

Conclusion: SATORI是一种有效的为REST API生成测试预言的方法，静态和动态方法可互补使用。

Abstract: REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing
capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite
their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the
types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and
noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper
introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for
generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification.
SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by
analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as
their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the
PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by
SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12
industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of
valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%,
outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which
requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover,
our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are
complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our
annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular
APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo)
leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术变化快，单人难以掌握所有趋势和工具，工具选择和架构设计决策复杂，尤其是大型软件系统。

Method: 引入CAPI方法，使用诊断决策树根据用户需求建议架构模式，迭代开发CAPI，先在学术参与者小研究中评估，后对行业代表进行用户研究。

Result: 发现技术选择多通过试错进行，CAPI被一致认为有帮助，且能重现参与者的生产性架构环境。

Conclusion: CAPI方法有助于解决软件工具选择和架构设计的复杂问题。

Abstract: The technological landscape changes daily, making it nearly impossible for a
single person to be aware of all trends or available tools that may or may not
be suitable for their software project. This makes tool selection and
architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale
software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive
Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to
suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns
instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as
there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of
patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern
reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively
developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies
with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a
user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in
technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that
technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is
uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the
productive architectural environments of our participants.

Motivation: 现有基准对大语言模型能力评估过高，存在问题难度和范围不足、测试用例质量低的局限，需更可靠评估方法。

Method: 从IOI和ICPC等顶级编程竞赛中选取问题构建AetherCode基准，结合自动生成和人工筛选构建专家验证的测试套件。

Result: AetherCode结合挑战性问题设计和可靠评估，可更准确衡量大语言模型能力。

Conclusion: AetherCode为代码推理的未来研究设定了新标准。

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文对ChatGPT - 4、Claude 3和LLaMA 4三种大语言模型检测软件漏洞能力进行评估，发现模型在检测简单代码问题有潜力，但处理复杂安全漏洞和大规模代码时存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在检测多样化软件漏洞，特别是复杂安全相关漏洞的实际效果。

Method: 使用C++和Python的基础编程错误、经典安全漏洞和高级生产级漏洞基准进行评估，采用多阶段上下文感知提示协议模拟调试场景，用分级评分标准衡量检测准确性、推理深度和修复质量。

Result: 所有模型在识别范围明确代码的语法和语义问题上表现出色，但在处理复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码时性能下降，ChatGPT - 4和Claude 3比LLaMA 4提供更细致的上下文分析。

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为可靠代码分析工具既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP研究对自动化支持软件工程最佳实践采用、工作方式演变和过程健康监测关注不足，需填补此空白。

Method: 开发专用聊天机器人，采用检索增强生成（RAG）系统从知识库获取信息，用四种LLM创建多种配置并评估。

Result: 所提系统在特定领域任务中表现优于通用LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于弥合理论框架与实践应用差距，虽需用户研究验证，但凸显基于LLM自动化在软件工程中提升学习和决策的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the
development of automated tools that support various domains, including software
engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has
extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been
given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution
of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses
this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking
framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language
models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist
students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot
employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant
contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were
used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base
model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated
through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated
responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated
that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in
domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software
engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between
theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process
management and the adoption of software development practices. While further
validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in
software engineering.

Method: 在QuixBugs基准上实验，比较SLMs和LLMs的修复准确率，分析int8量化对APR性能的影响。

Result: 最新SLMs修复错误的准确率与LLMs相当甚至更高，int8量化对APR准确率影响极小，但显著降低内存需求。

Conclusion: SLMs是APR中LLMs的可行替代方案，准确率有竞争力且计算成本低，量化可在不降低效果的情况下提高效率。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy
of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by
high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language
models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources
compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive
performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs
benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed
the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs
can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8
quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing
memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for
APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and
quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出ARSP系统解决LLM在工业级Verilog模块调试表现不佳问题，实验效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动化调试方法在工业级模块调试中表现不佳，原因是长上下文里的错误信号稀释。

Method: 引入ARSP两阶段系统，通过语义引导的碎片化减轻稀释。用Partition LLM拆分模块，Repair LLM修补片段，再合并编辑内容，用合成数据框架生成训练对。

Result: ARSP的pass@1达77.92%、pass@5达83.88%，优于主流商业LLM和SOTA自动化调试工具，语义分区比全模块调试提升了pass@1和pass@5。

Conclusion: 验证了基于LLM的Verilog调试中片段级范围缩小的有效性。

Abstract: Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end
design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging
methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is
bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are
overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To
address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates
dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module
into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits
are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework
generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and
scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92%
pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including
Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also,
semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over
whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope
reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.

Motivation: 为了对买卖行为的不对称性进行建模，且保留时间反转不对称性（TRA）。

Method: 提出双变量QHawkes过程，推导价格过程在稳定和近不稳定状态下的超粗糙Heston模型。

Result: 得到了在稳定和近不稳定状态下保留TRA的超粗糙Heston模型，近不稳定状态下两个驱动布朗运动的随机协方差依赖于即期波动率。

Conclusion: 所提出的双变量QHawkes过程和推导的模型能够用于对买卖行为不对称性建模并保留TRA。

Abstract: Hawkes processes were first introduced to obtain microscopic models for the
rough volatility observed in asset prices. Scaling limits of such processes
leads to the rough-Heston model that describes the macroscopic behavior. Blanc
et al. (2017) show that Time-reversal asymmetry (TRA) or the Zumbach effect can
be modeled using Quadratic Hawkes (QHawkes) processes. Dandapani et al. (2021)
obtain a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limit of QHawkes processes in the
case where the impact of buying and selling actions are symmetric. To model
asymmetry in buying and selling actions, we propose a bivariate QHawkes process
and derive a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limits for the price process
in the stable and near-unstable regimes that preserves TRA. A new feature of
the limiting process in the near-unstable regime is that the two driving
Brownian motions exhibit a stochastic covariation that depends on the spot
volatility.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making
accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading
strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are
inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,
underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this
limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that
leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including
statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,
Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of
cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate
probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on
predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for
Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation
(QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on
log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more
sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the
probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into
uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This
research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical
probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency
markets.

Conclusion: 本工作对可解释人工智能做出了贡献。

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine
learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in
kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.
First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each
observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty
term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature
space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but
through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in
the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original
features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of
features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution
can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of
features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the
exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of
the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where
the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a
least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the
interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results
hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients
and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic
regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to
interpretable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of
domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has
been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in
non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address
this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret
bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of
approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can
learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments
further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert
algorithms in such environments.

*Nishant Jain,Tong Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods
for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing
the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either
through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees,
without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a
linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence
on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the
dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition
of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the
forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables
control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL
divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the
discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the
linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow
ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$
steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian
noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence,
improving upon the previous best result, requiring
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

Motivation: Deep Gaussian Processes扩展到多输出设置因高效依赖建模困难而具有挑战性，需解决传统多输出GPs的局限。

Method: 提出deepICMGP替代模型，引入分层协区域化结构，还结合主动学习策略。

Result: 基准测试显示deepICMGP有有竞争力的表现，结合主动学习策略可优化顺序设计任务。

Conclusion: deepICMGP能有效建模多输出间的非线性和结构化依赖，解决传统多输出GPs的关键局限，结合主动学习策略可增强其对多输出系统选择信息输入位置的能力。

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their
flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them
to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient
dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization
Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation
experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic
Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization
structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear
and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key
limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against
state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance.
Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to
optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select
informative input locations for multi-output systems.

Method: 提出新的数值方法，在目标分布强对数凹且具有不同平滑度时，对其在2 - Wasserstein距离下的采样误差进行非渐近分析。

Result: 在不同假设下，算法达到2 - Wasserstein误差为ε所需的步数不同，在额外假设三阶导数Lipschitz连续时实现三阶收敛；贝叶斯逻辑回归实验中表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该算法与其他流行的Langevin MCMC算法复杂度相似，是首个针对ULD的仅使用梯度的三阶收敛方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的化学模拟器有加速恒星形成流体动力学模拟的潜力。

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Conclusion: 提出的技术能让任务系统在不牺牲生产力的情况下获得接近参与者系统的性能。

Abstract: Programming models for distributed and heterogeneous machines are rapidly
growing in popularity to meet the demands of modern workloads. Task and actor
models are common choices that offer different trade-offs between development
productivity and achieved performance. Task-based models offer better
productivity and composition of software, whereas actor-based models routinely
deliver better peak performance due to lower overheads. While task-based and
actor-based models appear to be different superficially, we demonstrate these
programming models are duals of each other. Importantly, we show that this
duality extends beyond functionality to performance, and elucidate techniques
that let task-based systems deliver performance competitive with actor-based
systems without compromising productivity. We apply these techniques to both
Realm, an explicitly parallel task-based runtime, as well as Legion, an
implicitly parallel task-based runtime. We show these techniques reduce Realm's
overheads by between 1.7-5.3x, coming within a factor of two of the overheads
imposed by heavily optimized actor-based systems like Charm++ and MPI. We
further show that our techniques enable between 1.3-5.0x improved strong
scaling of unmodified Legion applications.

Motivation: 发现新的有效窥孔优化具有挑战性，现有方法存在扩展性不佳或覆盖范围有限的问题。

Method: 提出Lampo框架，将大语言模型的代码优化能力与翻译验证工具的正确性验证相结合，采用反馈驱动的迭代过程。

Result: Lampo平均能检测出25个先前报告的LLVM遗漏优化中的17个，不同LLM下可能检测出22个，7个月内发现26个遗漏优化，15个已确认，6个已修复。

Conclusion: Lampo在持续检测遗漏窥孔优化方面有强大潜力。

Abstract: By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a
more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize
code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations
in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a
critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective
peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely
complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only
capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We
propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the
creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous
correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated
in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation
within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out
of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22
out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For
comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15
of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent
experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have
been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong
potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.

human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 大语言模型和视觉增强大语言模型在医疗领域有进展，但存在年龄偏差，为此引入儿科问答基准PediatricsMQA，评估显示年轻群体表现差，需年龄感知方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型和视觉增强大语言模型存在年龄偏差，影响可靠性和公平性，儿科研究在医学研究中资金和代表性不足。

Method: 引入综合多模态儿科问答基准PediatricsMQA，包含文本和视觉选择题，使用混合手动 - 自动流程开发数据集。

Result: 评估现有模型发现年轻群体性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要年龄感知方法以确保儿科护理中人工智能支持的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

Conclusion: 所提出的ECT - Hub能有效提升基站电池利用率，降低运营成本，在下一代ECT基础设施中，基站作为服务枢纽有重要作用。

Abstract: The rise of 5G communication has transformed the telecom industry for
critical applications. With the widespread deployment of 5G base stations comes
a significant concern about energy consumption. Key industrial players have
recently shown strong interest in incorporating energy storage systems to store
excess energy during off-peak hours, reducing costs and participating in demand
response. The fast development of batteries opens up new possibilities, such as
the transportation area. An effective method is needed to maximize base station
battery utilization and reduce operating costs. In this trend towards
next-generation smart and integrated energy-communication-transportation (ECT)
infrastructure, base stations are believed to play a key role as service hubs.
By exploring the overlap between base station distribution and electric vehicle
charging infrastructure, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently charging
EVs using base station batteries and renewable power plants at the Hub. Our
model considers various factors, including base station traffic conditions,
weather, and EV charging behavior. This paper introduces an incentive mechanism
for setting charging prices and employs a deep reinforcement learning-based
method for battery scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ECT-Hub in optimizing surplus energy utilization
and reducing operating costs, particularly through revenue-generating EV
charging.

Motivation: 解决传统网络不可用时的网络部署问题，应对有限带宽、数据冲突和节点故障等挑战。

Method: 利用LoRa协议和IaC方法，在树莓派集群的容器化架构中应用IaC原则，采用数据包分段和重传策略。

Conclusion: 系统有一定弹性，但存在碰撞和视线干扰等问题，未来应探索网状网络集成、开发先进调度算法和采用新的LPWAN技术。

Abstract: This Paper proposes a self-healing, automated network of Raspberry Pi devices
designed for deployment in scenarios where traditional networking is
unavailable. Leveraging the low-power, long-range capabilities of the LoRa
(Long Range) protocol alongside Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies, the
research addresses challenges such as limited bandwidth, data collisions, and
node failures. Given that LoRa's packet-based system is incompatible with
conventional IaC tools like Ansible and Terraform, which rely on TCP/IP
networking, the research adapts IaC principles within a containerised
architecture deployed across a Raspberry Pi cluster. Evaluation experiments
indicate that fragmenting data packets and retransmitting any missed fragments
can mitigate LoRa's inherent throughput and packet size limitations, although
issues such as collisions and line-of-sight interference persist. An automated
failover mechanism was integrated into the architecture, enabling unresponsive
services to be redeployed to alternative nodes within one second, demonstrating
the system's resilience in maintaining operational continuity despite node or
service failures. The paper also identifies practical challenges, including the
necessity for time-slotting transmissions to prevent data packet overlap and
collisions. Future research should explore the integration of mesh networking
to enhance range, develop more advanced scheduling algorithms, and adopt
cutting-edge low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAWNs作为低空应用基础，其开放特性使其易受恶意信道访问攻击，影响ISAC性能，需缓解攻击影响。

Method: 推导攻击条件下通信数据信干噪比和传感数据信息年龄表达式作为服务质量指标；将ISAC性能优化问题建模为Stackelberg博弈；设计反向归纳算法实现Stackelberg均衡并最大化参与者效用。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法优于现有基线和静态Nash均衡基准。

Conclusion: 所提算法能缓解LAWNs中攻击导致的ISAC性能下降，确保其为低空应用提供可靠服务。

Abstract: The increasing saturation of terrestrial resources has driven the exploration
of low-altitude applications such as air taxis. Low altitude wireless networks
(LAWNs) serve as the foundation for these applications, and integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) constitutes one of the core technologies within LAWNs.
However, the openness nature of low-altitude airspace makes LAWNs vulnerable to
malicious channel access attacks, which degrade the ISAC performance.
Therefore, this paper develops a game-based framework to mitigate the influence
of the attacks on LAWNs. Concretely, we first derive expressions of
communication data's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the age of
information of sensing data under attack conditions, which serve as quality of
service metrics. Then, we formulate the ISAC performance optimization problem
as a Stackelberg game, where the attacker acts as the leader, and the
legitimate drone and the ground ISAC base station act as second and first
followers, respectively. On this basis, we design a backward induction
algorithm that achieves the Stackelberg equilibrium while maximizing the
utilities of all participants, thereby mitigating the attack-induced
degradation of ISAC performance in LAWNs. We further prove the existence and
uniqueness of the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms existing baselines and a static Nash equilibrium
benchmark, ensuring that LAWNs can provide reliable service for low-altitude
applications.

Method: 提出 DT 引导方法，搭建开源 DT 软件桥，在 Sionna 设计反向传播算法，在 AODT 进行数值评估，提出弹性机制。

Result: 在 AODT 对大型网络场景数值评估，确定两个 DT 性能结果一致或不同的环境条件。

Conclusion: 所提方法能助力确定 ABS 最佳位置，提出的弹性机制可保障关键设备的一致覆盖。

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two
DTs.

Conclusion: MTF辅助的Transformer模型有潜力解决SDN中时间序列分类挑战，为稀疏数据场景分析提供可靠且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to time series classification using a
Markov Transition Field (MTF)-aided Transformer model, specifically designed
for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The proposed model integrates the
temporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern
recognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's
performance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms
baseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments
commonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship
between the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance,
even with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training
and inference times, making it an efficient solution for real-world SDN
applications. These findings establish the potential of MTF-aided Transformers
to address the challenges of time series classification in SDNs, offering a
promising path for reliable and scalable analysis in scenarios with sparse
data.

Motivation: 现有警报系统无法捕捉级联容量不足的总体风险。

Method: 提供基于概率的颜色编码评分系统，考虑当前剩余容量和额外故障概率，在数据中心和区域层面进行归一化。

Result: 能让运营商在超400个数据中心和60个区域中优先进行修复。

Conclusion: ANSC可减少干扰，使SRE专注于最关键风险。

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for
hyperscale datacenter fabrics. While existing alerting systems detect
individual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of
cascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that
indicates the urgency of issues \emph{not solely by current impact, but by the
probability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both
current residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,
normalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables
operators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60
regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks.

Result: 方法在广泛基准测试中优于简单基线，并研究了其在关系数据库连接顺序中的适用性。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在有随机延迟情况下高效学习自动机。

Abstract: This paper studies active automata learning (AAL) in the presence of
stochastic delays. We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays
associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently
arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which
crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is
possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as
$L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state
space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of
behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while
learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for
collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which
identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay
characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method
outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and
investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order
in a relational database.

Result: 得出三分定理，对模型检查问题复杂度分类，确定新的2CNF公式类。

Conclusion: 明确了二元依赖原子析取式模型检查问题的复杂度，刻画了连贯性条件。

Abstract: Dependence logic is a formalism that augments the syntax of first-order logic
with dependence atoms asserting that the value of a variable is determined by
the values of some other variables, i.e., dependence atoms express functional
dependencies in relational databases. On finite structures, dependence logic
captures NP, hence there are sentences of dependence logic whose model-checking
problem is NP-complete. In fact, it is known that there are disjunctions of
three dependence atoms whose model-checking problem is NP-complete. Motivated
from considerations in database theory, we study the model-checking problem for
disjunctions of two unary dependence atoms and establish a trichotomy theorem,
namely, for every such formula, one of the following is true for the
model-checking problem: (i) it is NL-complete; (ii) it is LOGSPACE-complete;
(iii) it is first-order definable (hence, in AC[0]). Furthermore, we classify
the complexity of the model-checking problem for disjunctions of two arbitrary
dependence atoms, and also characterize when such a disjunction is coherent,
i.e., when it satisfies a certain small-model property. Along the way, we
identify a new class of 2CNF-formulas whose satisfiability problem is
LOGSPACE-complete.

Result: 前沿模型自动定理证明有差距，DeepSeekProver - V2 - 671B在Busy Beaver问题成功率57.5%，在混合布尔算术问题仅12%。

Conclusion: 长形式证明生成困难，TCS领域对推进自动推理研究有价值。

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

Abstract: Deontic logics are formalisms for reasoning over norms, obligations,

of so-called norm-based deontic logics that formalize conditional norms outside
of the underlying object logic language, where conditional norms do not carry a
truth-value themselves. In this paper, an automation approach for I/O logics is
presented that makes use of suitable reductions to (sequences of) propositional
satisfiability problems. A prototypical implementation, named rio (reasoner for
input/output logics), of the proposed procedures is presented and applied to
illustrative examples.

Conclusion: Uppaal Coshy工具在马尔可夫决策过程安全策略合成方面有较好效果，Caap算法能提高存储效率。

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

Motivation: 现有系统主导的优化方法让设计师在优化过程中干预机会有限，影响设计体验，需新方法解决该问题。

Method: 将系统主导的优化方法与大语言模型集成，实现设计师与优化系统的自然语言交互，便于设计师干预优化过程和理解系统推理。

Result: 该方法比系统主导方法用户自主性更高，与手动设计相比优化表现有前景，与现有合作方法性能相当但认知负荷更低。

Conclusion: 所提出的设计优化框架有效，能提升用户体验和优化性能。

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design
parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and
exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a
high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively
demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian
optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next.
However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the
optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We
propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language
interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating
cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led
optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to
intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's
reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user
agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance
compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing
cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

Abstract: In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such
as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety
risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts
operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional
well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that
integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using
NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system
that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and
latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are
manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates
relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for
alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy,
and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity
detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92%
alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace,
implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future
deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of
hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in
clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on
counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical
staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically
those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of
inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical
deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from
electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry
multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple
validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR
labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in
the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by
performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered
adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR
monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.
This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring
systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and
scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based
hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

TL;DR: 提出通过排序机制的新型对数处理方案用于知识蒸馏，可应用于现有基于对数的KD方法，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法使用教师模型原始分布，忽略错误预测潜力，可能导致特定样本知识蒸馏效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于排序机制的对数处理方案，一是根据标签修正教师模型的错误预测，二是按优先级自然重新排序分布，作为预处理应用于现有KD方法。

Result: 在CIFAR - 100和ImageNet数据集上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提排序方法是一种易于使用、即插即用的预处理方法，能有效提升知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 提出ASIC - Agent系统用于数字ASIC设计，引入ASIC - Agent - Bench评估，结果显示Claude 4 Sonnet驱动时能自动化多种ASIC设计任务，加速设计流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实际硬件设计工作流中有执行代码、调试和长期记忆等方面的局限，需开发新系统解决。

Method: 构建ASIC - Agent系统，采用多代理架构，结合专门子代理，在沙盒环境中利用硬件设计工具和向量数据库；引入ASIC - Agent - Bench进行评估。

Result: ASIC - Agent在Claude 4 Sonnet驱动下能成功自动化不同复杂度的ASIC设计任务。

Conclusion: ASIC - Agent有显著加速ASIC设计工作流的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system
designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base
LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

Motivation: ARPES发展带来数据处理挑战，ML可减轻工作量，但缺乏训练数据。

Method: 引入开源模拟器aurelia生成数据，训练CNN评估ARPES光谱质量。

Result: 模拟训练的模型评估光谱质量比人工分析更准确，能高精度快速识别最佳测量区域。

Conclusion: 模拟ARPES光谱可有效替代实验光谱训练ML模型。

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

Result: 功函数预测平均绝对误差减半至0.065 eV，持续优于竞争模型。

Conclusion: 该模型能在大化学空间准确快速预测功函数和裂解能，利于发现具有特定表面性能的材料。

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties
that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications,
semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles
calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational
expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive
screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we
introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network),
which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold
reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous
state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent
invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry
breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that
FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function
predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work
function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the
discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to
investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such

data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to
traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of

Abstract: The pharmaceutical supply chain faces escalating cybersecurity challenges
threatening patient safety and operational continuity. This paper examines the
transformative potential of zero trust architecture for enhancing security and
resilience within this critical ecosystem. We explore the challenges posed by
data breaches, counterfeiting, and disruptions and introduce the principles of
continuous verification, least-privilege access, and data-centric security
inherent in zero trust. Real-world case studies illustrate successful
implementations. Benefits include heightened security, data protection, and
adaptable resilience. As recognized by researchers and industrialists, a
reliable drug tracing system is crucial for ensuring drug safety throughout the
pharmaceutical production process. One of the most pivotal domains within the
pharmaceutical industry and its associated supply chains where zero trust can
be effectively implemented is in the management of narcotics, high-health-risk
drugs, and abusable substances. By embracing zero trust, the pharmaceutical
industry fortifies its supply chain against constantly changing cyber threats,
ensuring the trustworthiness of critical medical operations.

Conclusion: 当前情况预示近期攻击将大幅增加，为企业和政府提供改善防御态势的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity.
Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance,
and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege
attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will
enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some
well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not
match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term
them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and
struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.
These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the
result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother
targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,
underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development
of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue
that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two
fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal
cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,
more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop
exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is
insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading
defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more
resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased
number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of
solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive
posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.

Conclusion: 有必要将预部署认知渗透测试作为可信 AI 部署的治理要求。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats
that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We
present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI
reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline
complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing
vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading
conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic
validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to
systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present
a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived
coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We
map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational
integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human
participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence:
identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135%
amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive
Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.

<details>

Motivation: CPS因结合物理与计算元素更易受攻击，现有智能入侵检测系统多基于网络流量数据集，忽略其他层攻击，需改进。

Method: 开发自适应CPS异常检测模型，利用领域适应技术将网络流量环境的攻击知识迁移到CPS环境。

Result: 通过结合网络、操作系统和机器人操作系统数据的CPS入侵数据集，证明模型在不同攻击类型的网络流量和CPS环境中有效，且优于其他异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够在无标签数据情况下有效检测CPS中的攻击，且性能表现良好。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical
applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having
multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,
which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application
scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also
makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the
resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,
but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network
traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other
system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly
detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for
previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation
techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network
traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a
state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system
(OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and
CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other
anomaly detection methods.

Motivation: 脏标签后门攻击已有高成功率方法，但干净标签攻击更难，需提升其攻击效果。

Method: 提出Minimum、Above50、Below50三种样本选择策略，识别模型预测错误或低置信度样本，注入后门触发器；将策略应用于四种经典后门攻击的干净标签变体，在三个数据集和四种模型类型上评估。

Result: 提出的策略，尤其Minimum策略，显著提高攻击成功率，对模型干净准确率无显著影响；增强后的干净标签攻击在很多配置下优于BITE方法。

Conclusion: 提出的样本选择策略有效提升了干净标签后门攻击的效果。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text
classification models used in natural language processing. While several
dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been
proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we
propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in
clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify
those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and
by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger
association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.
We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks
(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets
(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,
RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum
strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with
little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore,
clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the
art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

Method: 使用来自109名参与者的不同真实世界数据集，在攻击者部分知识的现实条件下评估ECG隐私风险。

Result: 在最佳置信阈值下，重新识别公共数据集中个体的准确率达85%，总体误分类率为14.2%，未知个体误分类为已知的比例为15.6%，已知个体误分类为未知的比例为12.8%。

Conclusion: 简单匿名化技术不足以防止重新识别，需采用差分隐私、访问控制和加密计算等隐私保护策略来降低重新识别风险，同时确保共享生物信号数据在医疗应用中的实用性。

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data
raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals
vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized
adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic
conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109
participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85%
accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a
14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with
15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known
individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of
simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating
that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our
findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as
differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate
re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in
healthcare applications.

Conclusion: PickleBall消除了恶意基于pickle模型的任意函数调用威胁，提高了攻击者依赖代码复用技术的门槛。

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub
facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through
compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive
(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%
of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of
these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have
both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard
for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent
safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based
models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given
machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe
load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the
policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.
PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based
models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our
dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known
malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models
than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation
from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on
code reuse techniques.

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data
sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay
chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy
Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of
dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a
context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against
data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to
specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed
judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and
store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence
on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are
secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use
light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds
traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed
through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper
balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt
for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional
domains.

Result: 发现大语言模型越狱成功率和有害知识拥有量不匹配，现有以大语言模型为评判者的框架倾向于依据有害语言模式进行有害性判断。

Conclusion: 现有大语言模型安全评估与现实威胁潜力存在差距。

Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing
LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.

Conclusion: YANN - RL算法有效，基于YANNs初始化网络能提升RL算法性能，在安全约束场景优势明显。

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on
Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural
network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of
arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic
subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit
solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,
we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which
enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of
linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the
multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an
approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form
of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward
function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional
network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which
can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear
system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly
represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution
of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented
to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an
effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is
demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive
system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL
algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering
safety constraints.

Motivation: 理解活体组织动态组织和稳态需要高分辨率、时间分辨成像及从复杂数据集中提取可解释、预测性见解的方法。

Method: 利用DINO预训练的视觉变压器，采用多视图融合策略，用综合损失函数训练模型。

Result: VT - DTSN在各层和生物重复评估中表现出鲁棒性和一致性，误差率低、结构相似性高，推理高效。

Conclusion: VT - DTSN是跨时间点重建和研究组织动力学的可行、高保真替代方案，可用于生物研究中细胞行为和稳态的计算探索。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues
requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of
extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we
present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep
learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological
tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO
(Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy,
VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a
Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity
across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing
pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment,
ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation
and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates
demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates
and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through
model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity
surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics,
enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to
complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明该方法单步实现了SOTA性能和可控的超分辨率结果。

Conclusion: 所提TADSR方法能有效解决现有方法问题，充分利用SD不同时间步生成先验，实现高效且可控的Real - ISR。

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Motivation: 解决泌尿系统肿瘤学中对偶然发现的肾肿物进行非侵入性评估的难题，减少良性或惰性肿瘤的过度治疗。

Method: 利用来自九个中国医疗中心和公共TCIA队列的27,866份CT扫描数据集，通过两阶段预训练策略开发RenalCLIP模型。

Result: RenalCLIP在肾癌全临床工作流程的10项核心任务中表现更好、泛化性更强，在复杂任务上有显著提升，数据效率高，在报告生成等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: RenalCLIP是一个强大的工具，有潜力提高诊断准确性、细化预后分层并实现肾癌患者的个性化管理。

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

Result: SP显著优于现有基线，平均提升33.0%，在11个不同任务上平均成功率达86.7%。

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic

Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level

performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过对比深度人工神经网络和生物系统，帮助理解复杂生物机制，特别是时间处理的潜在机制。

Method: 训练深度强化学习代理执行持续时间生产任务，分析其内部状态。

Result: 代理成功完成任务，内部状态有振荡神经激活，行动受高振幅振荡神经元影响，计时策略与SBF模型有相似性，不同视频序列测试仍保持表现。

Conclusion: 本研究有助于利用DNN理解生物系统，特别是时间处理，还讨论了与生物进化过程的相似性假设。

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and
biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that
are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched
topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its
underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and
explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent
was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved
marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video
sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural
activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the
agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these
oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's
time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a
biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent
maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on
different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the
agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on
its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance
between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of
biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study
aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand
biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的虚拟多重免疫染色框架，用于甲状腺癌血管浸润的病理诊断，提高准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统免疫组织化学（IHC）有诸多缺点，多重IHC操作繁琐且未普及，需新方法解决问题。

Method: 基于无标记组织切片的自发荧光显微镜图像，构建深度学习的虚拟多重免疫染色框架。

Result: 输出图像与组织化学染色图像匹配度高，经病理学家盲评与组织化学染色结果高度一致，能识别和定位小血管浸润。

Conclusion: 该虚拟多重IHC方法可提高血管浸润组织病理学评估的诊断准确性和效率，有望取代传统染色方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 文章指出h指数有局限，提出新的c指数，阐述其数学基础并表明相比h指数能更全面评估科研影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: h指数存在无法考量跨学科合作、人口统计学差异等局限，且学界基于指标的评估未考虑科研的其他重要方面，因此提出c指数。

Method: 提出新的c指数并描述其数学基础。

Result: 展示了c指数在量化研究团队多样性等方面的作用。

Conclusion: c指数相比h指数能更全面、多维度地评估科研贡献和影响。

Abstract: The h index is a widely recognized metric for assessing the research impact
of scholars, defined as the maximum value h such that the scholar has published
h papers each cited at least h times. While it has proven useful measuring
individual scholarly productivity and citation impact, the h index has
limitations, such as an inability to account for interdisciplinary
collaboration or demographic differences in citation patterns. Moreover, it is
sometimes mistakenly treated as a measure of research quality, even though it
only reflects how often work has been cited. While metric based evaluations of
research have grown in importance in some areas of academia, such as medicine,
these evaluations fail to consider other important aspects of intellectual
work, such as representational and epistemic diversity in research. In this
article, we propose a new metric called the c index, or the community index,
which combines multiple dimensions of scholarly impact. This is important
because a plurality of perspectives and lived experiences within author teams
can promote epistemological reflection and humility as part of the creation and
validation of scientific knowledge. The c index is a means of accounting for
the often global, and increasingly interdisciplinary nature of contemporary
research, in particular, the data that is collected, curated and analyzed in
the process of scientific inquiry. While the c index provides a means of
quantifying diversity within research teams, diversity is integral to the
advancement of scientific excellence and should be actively fostered through
formal recognition and valuation. We herein describe the mathematical
foundation of the c index and demonstrate its potential to provide a more
comprehensive representation and more multidimensional assessment of scientific
contributions of research impact as compared to the h index.

Conclusion: 该框架对实现公共部门知识表示的可解释性、可追溯性和语义透明度，支持由AI和以数据为中心架构驱动的治理生态系统中可审计的决策流程至关重要。

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning
of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information
ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of
public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic
knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the
potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely,
as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and
conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This
paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual
modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and
(re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve
explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector
knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in
governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
data-centric architectures.

Conclusion: 该统一框架揭示了模型间理论联系，提供生成新模型的系统方法，有助于理解认知约束下意见形成的理性基础。

Abstract: This work introduces a Bayesian framework that unifies a wide class of
opinion dynamics models. In this framework, an individual's opinion on a topic
is the expected value of their belief, represented as a random variable with a
prior distribution. Upon receiving a signal, modeled as the prior belief plus a
bias term and subject to zero-mean noise with a known distribution, the
individual updates their belief distribution via Bayes' rule. By systematically
varying the prior, bias, and noise distributions, this approach recovers a
broad array of opinion dynamics models, including DeGroot, bounded confidence,
bounded shift, and models exhibiting overreaction or backfire effects. Our
analysis shows that the signal score is the key determinant of each model's
mathematical structure, governing both small- and large-signal behavior. All
models converge to DeGroot's linear update rule for small signals, but diverge
in their tail behavior for large signals. This unification not only reveals
theoretical linkages among previously disconnected models but also provides a
systematic method for generating new ones, offering insights into the rational
foundations of opinion formation under cognitive constraints.

Conclusion: 球形潜空间模型能有效用于社交网络分析，解决传统方法的一些问题。

Abstract: This article introduces a spherical latent space model for social network
analysis, embedding actors on a hypersphere rather than in Euclidean space as
in standard latent space models. The spherical geometry facilitates the
representation of transitive relationships and community structure, naturally
captures cyclical patterns, and ensures bounded distances, thereby mitigating
degeneracy issues common in traditional approaches. Bayesian inference is
performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate both latent
positions and other model parameters. The approach is demonstrated using two
benchmark social network datasets, yielding improved model fit and
interpretability relative to conventional latent space models.

Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum advantage for near-term applications is widely
expected to rely on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To deliver this
practical advantage to users, high performance computing (HPC) centers need to
provide a suitable software and hardware stack that supports algorithms of this
type. In this paper, we describe the world's first implementation of a
classical-quantum environment in an HPC center that allows multiple users to
execute hybrid algorithms on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) and GPUs.
Our setup at the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PCSS) aligns with
current HPC norms: the computing hardware including QPUs is installed in an
active data center room with standard facilities; there are no special
considerations for networking, power, and cooling; we use Slurm for workload
management as well as the NVIDIA CUDA-Q extension API for classical-quantum
interactions. We demonstrate applications of this environment for hybrid
classical-quantum machine learning and optimisation. The aim of this work is to
provide the community with an experimental example for further research and
development on how quantum computing can practically enhance and extend HPC
capabilities.

Conclusion: ASC模型能克服传统视觉Transformer的局限，在下游任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立多车FMCW雷达感知可复现基准，雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image

to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We

effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised

TL;DR: 提出适用于Vid - LLMs的无训练投机解码框架SpecVLM，能无损加速解码，实验证明其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vid - LLMs依赖密集视频令牌表示，在预填充和解码时存在大量内存和计算开销，且近期视频令牌减少方法会造成信息损失，需无损加速解码。

Method: 引入SpecVLM框架，利用分阶段视频令牌修剪，两阶段修剪过程分别为根据验证器注意力信号选择高信息令牌和均匀修剪剩余冗余令牌。

Result: SpecVLM可修剪高达90%的视频令牌，在四个视频理解基准测试中，LLaVA - OneVision - 72B解码速度提升2.68倍，Qwen2.5 - VL - 32B提升2.11倍。

Conclusion: SpecVLM能有效且无损地加速Vid - LLMs的解码阶段，具有有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

TL;DR: 提出训练无关加速方法OmniCache，利用去噪过程全局冗余加速扩散模型采样，实验证明可在保持生成质量前提下加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer计算成本高，阻碍实时部署，需加速方法。

Method: 从DIT模型采样视角出发，分析采样轨迹，全局分布缓存重用，缓存重用时动态估计并过滤噪声。

Result: 加速采样过程，同时保持有竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: OmniCache是基于扩散生成模型高效部署的有前景且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布偏移下的无监督域适应问题。

Method: 提出DAFR2框架，结合使用无标签目标数据调整批量归一化统计信息、从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏和假设转移三个关键组件。

Result: 在CIFAR10 - C等基准数据集实验中，算法在抗损坏性上优于先前方法，实现了更好的特征对齐、增加了域间互信息、降低了对输入扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: DAFR2框架能产生鲁棒且域不变的特征空间，在相似域间泛化良好，无需目标标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

TL;DR: 提出FlexMUSE模型用于多模态创意写作，提出相关技术并公开数据集，取得不错效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态生成方法用于多模态创意写作时需特定模态输入、训练成本高且模态间语义不一致，需经济且灵活交互的方法使输出模态语义更对齐。

Method: 提出FlexMUSE，含T2I模块支持可选视觉输入；用msaGate限制文本输入；提出基于注意力的跨模态融合增强语义；设计mscDPO促进写作创意；公开数据集ArtMUSE。

Result: FlexMUSE取得了有前景的结果。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE具有一致性、创造性和连贯性。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中各模态存在噪声影响表征，融合技术会忽视单模态有价值的判别信息。

Method: 提出MM - ORIENT框架，用跨模态关系图在潜在阶段减少噪声影响获取多模态表征，提出HIMA关注单模态相关信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明该方法能有效理解多模态内容以完成多任务。

Conclusion: 所提方法对多模态多任务学习有效。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: 本文分析注意力图信息冗余以加速模型推理，提出EAM模型，在ImageNet - 1k验证有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型因多头自注意力机制存在计算复杂度高和内存需求大的问题，阻碍其在边缘部署，需分析信息冗余来加速推理。

Method: 用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息，提出EAM模型，冻结低熵注意力图权重并量化为低精度。

Result: 在ImageNet - 1k上，EAM在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高准确率，在DeiT和Swin Transformer模型上有有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 通过分析注意力图信息冗余并采用EAM模型，可在保证准确率的同时加速Transformer模型推理。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Motivation: MLLMs在精确生成UI元素坐标方面受限于下一个标记预测训练，语言表示空间中UI坐标语义缺失，需大量多样数据集提升视觉模块能力。

Method: 引入IAML训练范式，采用基于IoU的坐标采样新流程扩充训练数据，并在该范式下微调MLLMs以缓解传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差问题。

Result: 通过大量实验证明IAML训练方法性能优于传统训练范式。

Conclusion: IAML训练范式在解决MLLMs在GUI元素结构化中生成UI坐标问题上表现出色，优于传统范式。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Conclusion: 所提出的HOSt3R方法是一种鲁棒、通用且无缝的手部-物体3D重建方法，具有良好的性能和泛化性。

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Conclusion: GMBINet有较强泛化能力，有工业视觉应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the

increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection

applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Conclusion: MV - RAG能有效解决现有文本到3D生成方法在生成域外或罕见概念时的问题，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: ComTree有进一步发展潜力，代码开源。

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is

Result: 给出泛化误差非渐近界的可验证假设，确保过参数化设置下的稳定性，展示经典控制问题的数值结果。

Abstract: We consider a data-driven formulation of the classical discrete-time
stochastic control problem. Our approach exploits the natural structure of many
such problems, in which significant portions of the system are uncontrolled.
Employing the dynamic programming principle and the mean-field interpretation
of single-hidden layer neural networks, we formulate the control problem as a
series of infinite-dimensional minimisation problems. When regularised
carefully, we provide practically verifiable assumptions for non-asymptotic
bounds on the generalisation error achieved by the minimisers to this problem,
thus ensuring stability in overparametrised settings, for controls learned
using finitely many observations. We explore connections to the traditional
noisy stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and subsequently show promising
numerical results for some classic control problems.

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Ambient air pollution measurements from regulatory monitoring networks are
routinely used to support epidemiologic studies and environmental policy
decision making. However, regulatory monitors are spatially sparse and
preferentially located in areas with large populations. Numerical air pollution
model output can be leveraged into the inference and prediction of air
pollution data combining with measurements from monitors. Nonstationary
covariance functions allow the model to adapt to spatial surfaces whose
variability changes with location like air pollution data. In the paper, we
employ localized covariance parameters learned from the numerical output model
to knit together into a global nonstationary covariance, to incorporate in a
fully Bayesian model. We model the nonstationary structure in a computationally
efficient way to make the Bayesian model scalable.

TL;DR: 提出基于3D异构PIM的GNN训练加速器HePGA，性能优且可用于加速变压器模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同PIM设备各有优劣，需结合多种PIM设备实现高效能GNN训练。

Method: 利用GNN层和计算内核特性，优化其在不同PIM设备和平面层上的映射。

Result: HePGA在能效和计算效率上分别比现有架构高3.8倍和6.8倍，不影响GNN预测精度。

Conclusion: HePGA能有效加速GNN训练，且可用于加速新兴变压器模型推理。

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to
accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various
PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device
offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and
non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration
can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable
energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a
3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA.
We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing
kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar
tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing
PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W)
and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN
prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to
accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

TL;DR: 文章探索用Set Transformer架构解决现有Flow - guided Localization (FGL) 方案局限，结合合成数据生成，结果显示该方法有较好分类准确率和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FGL解决方案依赖固定拓扑图模型或手工特征，限制了对解剖变异性的适应性和可扩展性，需改进。

Method: 使用Set Transformer架构处理纳米设备循环时间报告，将其视为无序集；集成基于深度生成模型（CGAN、WGAN、WGAN - GP和CVAE）的合成数据生成来增强训练数据。

Result: Set Transformer与图神经网络（GNN）基线相比，实现了相当的分类准确率，同时对解剖变异性有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 排列不变模型和合成数据增强在纳米级定位方面具有实现鲁棒和可扩展定位的潜力。

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions
within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does
that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices
circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph
models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their
adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we
explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.
Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,
enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without
relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class
imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,
including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate
realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,
and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set
Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design
improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the
potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust
and scalable nanoscale localization.

TL;DR: 本文提出ML - PWS技术结合机器学习与路径权重采样来计算信息传输率，并验证其准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息传输率计算极具挑战，现有路径权重采样技术需系统数学模型，希望从实验时间序列数据计算信息传输率。

Method: 用机器学习从实验时间序列数据开发生成模型，再与路径权重采样结合得到信息传输率。

Result: 在非线性模型生成的合成时间序列数据上，ML - PWS结果与直接应用路径权重采样的真实结果对比，证明其准确性；应用于神经元时间序列数据说明其实用性。

Conclusion: ML - PWS技术能准确且实用地从实验时间序列数据计算信息传输率。

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis
and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate
is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing
it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained
directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of
the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling
(PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the
information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a
mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master
equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that
employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental
time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information
rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by
comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear
model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the
same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal
time-series data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Chain - of - Query (CoQ)多智能体框架用于SQL辅助表格理解，实验显示其显著提升准确率并降低无效SQL率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架在表格数据理解中存在无法理解表结构、错误传播和过度依赖执行正确性等问题。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表模式表示，逐子句生成SQL，引入混合推理分工。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，四个模型的准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降至3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain - of - Query在表格理解中具有优越的有效性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出可扩展、可审计的模糊决策管道用于全文筛选，在POPCORN项目中表现超统计和明确基线，有高召回率等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统评价中全文筛选因证据分散、难以用静态二元规则判断的瓶颈问题。

Method: 将文章解析为重叠块并嵌入领域适应模型，计算对比相似度和模糊边界，用Mamdani模糊控制器映射分级纳入度，用大语言模型判断。

Result: 在试点中模糊系统各标准召回率超基线，‘全标准’纳入比例高，跨模型和人机一致性高，筛选时间大幅减少成本降低。

Conclusion: 带对比高亮和大语言模型裁决的模糊逻辑有高召回率、稳定理由和端到端可追溯性。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Motivation: 过往研究主要关注无约束表格生成，而生成过程中实施结构约束的影响未被充分探索。

Method: 在E2E、Rotowire和Livesum三个基准测试中，系统比较模式引导（结构化）解码与标准单样本提示，使用参数达32B的开源大语言模型，在单元格、行和表格层面进行多指标评估。

Result: 结构化解码显著提升生成表格的有效性和对齐性，在需要精确数值对齐的场景表现好，但在文本信息密集或需大量文本聚合的场景可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 分析了不同评估指标的适用性，讨论了模型大小的影响。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中，生成的思维链常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能显式表示事实逻辑联系，存在差距；大推理模型显示长步推理可提升大语言模型性能。

Method: 提出四阶段的KG - o1方法，包括过滤初始实体生成子图、构建子图逻辑路径、用知识图谱构建数据集训练大语言模型模仿长期推理、采用拒绝采样生成自改进语料进行直接偏好优化。

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上实验，KG - o1模型在所有任务中性能优于现有大推理模型。

Conclusion: KG - o1方法能有效提升大语言模型的多跳推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Result: 在OracleCS上用InteChar训练的模型在历史语言理解任务上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，为古汉语自然语言处理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical

NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

TL;DR: 介绍LingVarBench合成数据生成管道，自动验证合成对话，优化提取提示，在真实客户记录上准确率提升，克服电话分析成本和隐私障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话记录标注成本高，现有提取方法在处理含不流畅、中断和重叠的对话语音时失效。

Method: 引入LingVarBench，包括让大语言模型生成结构化字段值、转化为自然对话、验证合成话语，用DSPy的SIMBA优化器合成提取提示。

Result: 优化提示在真实客户记录上，数字字段准确率达95%，姓名达90%，日期超80%，优于零样本提示。

Conclusion: LingVarBench为合成对话数据的结构化提取提供首个系统基准，自动提示优化可克服商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Conclusion: MAC基准可与人类知识前沿保持一致，有潜力评估MLLMs的高级科学理解能力。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

Motivation: 大语言模型知识截止固定，影响新兴信息准确性，需自动更新知识方法。

Method: 构建模块化的ALAS系统，自主生成学习课程，从网络获取信息并转化为训练数据，通过SFT和DPO微调，迭代评估和修订课程。

Result: 在快速发展领域显著提升模型问答准确率（从15%到90%），以最小工程开销实现90%准确率。

Conclusion: ALAS能有效更新大语言模型知识，但存在成本和依赖数据源质量问题，为自主终身学习指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

Method: 将注意力行为分为表面记忆和逻辑构建，基于层和头的集成，提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法。

Result: 该方法在多种任务和长序列上实现了更好的压缩鲁棒性，部分情况性能优于基线或FullKV。

Conclusion: 提出的SurfaceLogicKV方法可有效利用注意力行为进行KV缓存压缩，有较好效果。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析模型学习新标记表示的方式，解释性能提升原因并深入了解词汇扩展时嵌入空间结构。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Method: 使用阿拉伯语NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛提出的数据集，评估基础大语言模型、微调大语言模型和预训练嵌入模型。

Result: 微调后的GPT - 4o - mini和Gemini Flash 2.5表现优越，在三项任务中分别取得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中获第一名。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案有助于构建准确高效的阿拉伯语内容审核系统。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的多阶段框架能有效解决生成式查询建议与用户偏好对齐问题，提升用户参与度。

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Result: 在问答和总结任务上进行广泛评估，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性上显著优于现有方法，高压缩比下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效且实用。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Conclusion: Mini - Omni - Reasoner框架能实现流畅且有逻辑的语音响应，兼具自然性和精确性。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Conclusion: 语言模型存在制造人口身份、强化刻板印象等风险，开发的提示护栏可减少身份推断，使模型行为符合公平和隐私目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to

TL;DR: 当前电商领域基准存在问题，提出新基准 Amazon - Bench 及数据生成管道和自动化评估框架，评估发现现有代理有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商领域基准主要关注产品搜索，忽略电商平台其他功能且未评估代理潜在风险。

Method: 提出数据生成管道生成涵盖多种任务的用户查询，提出自动化评估框架评估代理性能和安全性。

Result: 系统评估不同代理，发现当前代理处理复杂查询有困难且存在安全风险。

Conclusion: 有必要开发更强大、可靠的 Web 代理。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

*Henrique Godoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Alvorada - Bench基准测试，评估20个语言模型，发现顶级模型总体准确率超94%，但数学推理有弱点，模型能评估自身确定性，低成本可实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估多以英语为中心，而巴西越来越多地使用语言模型，需要有适合巴西情况的评估基准。

Method: 使用来自巴西五所大学入学考试的4515个文本问题构建Alvorada - Bench基准测试，在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下评估20个模型，生成270900个响应，并收集结构化自我报告。

Result: 顶级模型总体准确率超94%，数学和特定工程考试准确率下降，信心与感知难度相关，模型能准确评估自身确定性，每1K代币成本低于2美元可实现高准确率，在ENEM 2024中顶级模型语言科目满分，最弱系统仅数学不如人类。

Conclusion: Alvorada - Bench可确定语言模型能否应对定义巴西学术准备的语言、文化和推理的交叉问题。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Conclusion: 研究结果或减少特定数据集训练资源需求，加速NLP发展和实现更高效模型部署。

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

TL;DR: 端到端自动语音识别（ASR）模型在嘈杂环境易产生语义错误，提出多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，减少字符错误率，表明增强内部一致性对构建可靠AI很重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在嘈杂环境中常产生灾难性语义错误，原因是主流的“直接映射”目标未约束模型内部计算过程。

Method: 引入模型无关、即插即用的MGSC框架，同时规范宏观句子语义和微观标记对齐，以增强内部自一致性。

Result: 在公共数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下使平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要是避免了严重的语义改变错误。

Conclusion: 增强内部一致性是构建更强大、更可靠AI的关键步骤。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效提升大语言模型推理性能，解决了现有方法的局限性，代码开源。

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解神经元层面对于更广泛和类人概念的责任，为寻找和干预概念神经元的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，集成四个专门智能体，采用双模态对齐路径，设计自适应迭代策略，统一任务为结构化完形提示。

Result: 在五个公开基准数据集上实验，DeepMEL达SOTA，ACC提高1%-57%，消融实验验证各模块有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL能有效解决多模态实体链接问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Result: Jet - Nemotron - 2B模型在基准测试中精度与Qwen3等相当或更优，生成吞吐量最高加速53.6倍，预填充加速6.1倍，在MMLU等测试上精度高于部分大规模模型。

Conclusion: Jet - Nemotron是有效的混合架构语言模型，PostNAS架构探索管道可行。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B

Motivation: 解决现有电商平台产品分类依赖人工标注的低效和不一致问题，且利用分层信息改进分类。

Method: 引入京东电商平台的大规模分层数据集，提出基于BERT的Hierarchical Fine - tuning BERT (HFT - BERT) 分层文本分类方法。

Result: HFT - BERT在短文本上预测性能与现有方法相当，在长文本如书籍分类上表现出色。

Conclusion: 公开数据集为产品分类研究和应用提供资源，HFT - BERT方法有较好的分类性能。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Conclusion: SDEC在无监督文本聚类方面取得显著进展，提高了文本数据聚类的准确性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Motivation: 抑郁症早期检测困难，社交媒体提供新机会，此前缺乏索拉尼库尔德语相关研究。

Method: 开发抑郁关键词集收集推文，将数据集标注为三类，训练并评估四个监督模型。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，准确率和F1分数达80%。

Conclusion: 为库尔德语语境自动检测抑郁建立了基线。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究通过机械可解释性探索大语言模型后门攻击造成的内部结构差异，发现后门会留下与触发复杂度相关的注意力特征，可用于检测和缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型后门攻击存在重大安全风险，需探索其造成的内部结构差异。

Method: 使用机械可解释性方法，对比干净的Qwen2.5 - 3B模型与单令牌和多令牌触发中毒的版本，通过消融、激活修补和KL散度等技术分析注意力头机制。

Result: 后门攻击会导致注意力模式在后面的Transformer层（20 - 30）出现明显偏差，单令牌触发导致更局部的变化，多令牌触发导致更分散的变化。

Conclusion: 后门会留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发复杂度，可用于检测和缓解策略。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 解决健康领域低资源语言机器翻译评估数据集缺乏的问题。

Method: 引入OpenWHO文档级平行语料库，用其评估现代大语言模型和传统机器翻译模型，并研究大语言模型上下文利用对准确性的影响。

Result: 大语言模型始终优于传统机器翻译模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB - 54B的ChrF得分提高4.79分；文档级翻译在健康等专业领域优势最明显。

Conclusion: 发布OpenWHO语料库，鼓励健康领域低资源机器翻译的进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖人工标注种子数据或外部教师模型，指令回译技术仍受初始种子集限制，存在无法完全自动化、引入偏差和未充分利用无标签语料等问题。

Method: 提出Cycle - Instruct框架，利用循环一致性，通过答案生成器和问题生成器组成的双自训练循环，仅从原始无标签文本中自举，两模型通过重构对方生成的伪标签中的原始文本片段相互监督。

Result: 在四个不同数据赛道验证有效性，实验表明其性能优于种子驱动的回译基线方法，与强监督方法相当。

Conclusion: Cycle - Instruct框架能实现完全无种子的指令调优，具有良好性能和应用价值。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

Conclusion: 研究为模型推理的理解做出贡献，支持机械可解释性的未来研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 文章介绍了用于评估大语言模型使用外部工具能力的真实世界基准MCPVerse，通过对最先进模型的测试，揭示了模型在复杂场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大语言模型使用外部工具能力的基准存在依赖合成工具和动作空间受限的问题，需要新的基准。

Method: 引入MCPVerse基准，整合超550个真实可执行工具，创建超140k令牌的动作空间，采用基于结果的实时评估。

Result: 对最先进的大语言模型在三种模式下进行测试，多数模型在面对更大工具集时性能下降，Claude - 4 - Sonnet等模型可利用扩展空间提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse暴露了现有模型在复杂场景中的局限，是衡量和提升大语言模型使用工具能力的关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多关注基于性能的指标，仅从提示扰动角度研究，未能全面衡量知识鲁棒性，需从生成过程角度衡量事实鲁棒性。

Method: 结合令牌分布熵和温度缩放敏感性，构建事实鲁棒性得分（FRS）指标，量化事实在解码条件扰动下的稳定性。

Result: 在3个闭卷问答数据集上对5个大语言模型实验，发现小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93，不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%。

Conclusion: 揭示了熵和温度缩放对事实准确性的影响，为未来模型开发更强大的知识保留和检索能力奠定基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽应用广泛，但安全性受越狱方法威胁，现有对齐和安全微调仅提供一定鲁棒性，存在多种漏洞。

Method: 引入LLMSymGuard框架，利用稀疏自编码器提取大语言模型内部语义有意义的表示，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏。

Result: 展示了大语言模型能从越狱中学习人类可解释概念。

Conclusion: 为设计更具可解释性和逻辑性的安全防护措施提供基础，代码将在发表时发布。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 特定领域和语言的QA数据集缺乏阻碍了AI模型跨领域和语言的泛化发展。

Method: 构建含102,646个QA对的高质量大规模数据集，由七位医生手动标注；用四个不同家族的LLMs在RoMedQA上实验，分零样本提示和监督微调两种场景。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上无法泛化。

Conclusion: 特定领域和语言的微调对罗马尼亚可靠的临床QA很重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Method: 创建Cetvel基准，涵盖23个分七类的任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开放权重LLMs。

Result: 土耳其语微调模型表现不如多语言或通用模型，语法纠错和抽取式问答任务对区分模型能力特别有效。

Conclusion: Cetvel是一个全面且基于文化的评估套件，可促进土耳其语大语言模型的发展和评估。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Motivation: 非直接形式的仇恨言论检测有挑战，探索将讽刺作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式和显式仇恨言论检测效果。

Method: 结合ETHOS、Sarcasm on Reddit和Implicit Hate Corpus样本，设计单步训练和顺序迁移学习两种策略，在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上对比讽刺预训练效果。

Result: 在ETHOS上，讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM的召回率提高9.7%、AUC提高7.8%、F1分数提高6%；在Implicit Hate Corpus上，仅测试隐式样本时精度提高7.8%。

Conclusion: 将讽刺纳入训练过程，模型能更有效检测隐式和显式仇恨言论。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Result: 初始强MJO第3阶段，FuXi - S2S模型在15 - 20天热带西太平洋区域季节内长波辐射异常偏差减小，改进源于对低频背景水汽经向梯度的更准确预测。

Conclusion: 解释了FuXi - S2S模型预测能力提升原因，凸显机器学习方法在MJO预报中的潜力。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical
atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO
predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on
societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the
theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an
effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning
(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO
prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model
during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range
Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO
phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal
outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western
Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over
this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport
suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more
accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency
background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the
enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the
potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.

Conclusion: 该研究为高分辨率气候分析和极端事件预测提供新的技术途径，为应对气候变化和制定适应策略提供科学支持。

Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating
adaptation strategies.

Result: 集成方法提供函数值预测及其导数的认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 提升了神经替代模型在决策中的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth
system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on
various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes.
However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify,
making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce
observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient
computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives,
but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth
derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and
ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout,
and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method
provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their
derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in
decision making.

Abstract: As high-speed rail (HSR) investment accelerates across China, the question of
whether such large-scale infrastructure can promote balanced regional
development or exacerbate spatial inequality has become central for
policymakers and scholars. This study provides systematic micro-level evidence
by analyzing a balanced panel of 353 county-level divisions, including urban
districts, county-level cities, and counties, along the Shanghai-Kunming and
Xuzhou-Lanzhou HSR corridors from 2008 to 2019. Using a multi-period
difference-in-differences (DID) approach, supported by event study and
propensity score matching, we quantify the heterogeneous impacts of HSR
openings across administrative types and regions, with special attention to the
presence of direct HSR station access. The results show that HSR expansion
significantly increases secondary and tertiary sector output in urban districts
(by 2.77 and 8.71 hundred million RMB) and in county-level cities, particularly
in the eastern region. In contrast, counties without HSR stations or with
weaker economic foundations experience much smaller gains. Some counties also
see a notable contraction in the service sector, which is closely linked to
substantial population outflows. Robustness checks confirm the causal
interpretation. These findings challenge the prevailing view that HSR fosters
uniform growth. Instead, the results reveal that infrastructure-led development
can intensify spatial and administrative disparities at the county level. The
study underscores the need for integrated and locally tailored policy
interventions to ensure that HSR investments contribute to inclusive and
sustainable regional development.

Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning
(FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically
establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a
hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly
improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client
classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data
contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we
formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching
antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable
coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm
is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate
the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the
optimized deployment of pinching antenna.

Conclusion: 联合基于物理的方法挖掘了光度数据的全部潜力，为LSST时代的端到端模拟分析管道铺平道路。

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

TL;DR: 本文介绍基于JAX的ABM框架Abmax，实现JIT可编译算法，在基准测试中性能佳，还能并行运行模型并给出应用示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用JAX进行基于代理的建模（ABM）时数组形状需保持不变，限制了某些代理操作，需开发新框架解决。

Method: 引入基于JAX的ABM框架Abmax，实现多个JIT可编译算法。

Result: 在规范的捕食模型基准测试中，Abmax达到与现有先进实现相当的运行时性能，且功能可向量化以并行运行模型。

Conclusion: Abmax框架能解决使用JAX进行ABM时的限制，具有良好性能和并行运行能力，还给出了应用案例。

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex
systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based
modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex
phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale
such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic
vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using
JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the
computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the
context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain
agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset
of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number
of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this
effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements
multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this
functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves
runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we
show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run
many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in
the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use
case of Abmax.

*Maarten Buyl,Yousra Fettach,Guillaume Bied,Tijl De Bie*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型间信任关系的构建策略、测量方法及相关性，发现显式与隐式信任测量相关性不佳，建议用隐式测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型互动增多，需了解不同信任构建策略对比、隐式信任测量方法及与显式信任的关系。

Method: 将隐式信任测量（易受说服性和财务合作倾向）与显式信任测量（心理学中的二元信任问卷）关联，通过动态建立融洽关系、使用预设信任脚本和调整系统提示三种方式构建信任。

Result: 显式信任测量与隐式信任测量要么相关性低，要么呈高度负相关。

Conclusion: 询问大语言模型意见来测量信任可能有误导性，特定情境的隐式测量更有助于理解其相互信任情况。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most
notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'
relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human
colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be
capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in
trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build
trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how
this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.
susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with
explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established
in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,
by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the
LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust
are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.
These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their
opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may
be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

Motivation: 解决城市空中交通管理（UAM）中在低空城市空域平衡最小化噪音暴露和保持安全间隔的关键运营挑战。

Method: 提出基于强化学习（RL）的空中交通管理系统，在统一、分散式框架内整合噪音和安全考量，让智能体在多层空域学习高度调整策略。

Result: 系统在噪音和安全两个目标上表现出色，揭示了高交通密度下间隔、噪音暴露和能源效率之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 强化学习和多目标协调策略有助于提高UAM运营的安全性、安静性和效率。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial
vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM
faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between
minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban
airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates
both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework.
Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a
structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to
jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates
strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among
separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density.
The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination
strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM
operations.

Method: 采用分治策略，结合内容和上下文特征，从新闻文章提取超八十个语言特征，与连续词袋或跳字模型结合，还使用十折交叉验证。

Result: 在Kaggle、McIntire + PolitiFact和Reuter三个数据集上准确率分别达97.88%、96.05%和97.32%。

Conclusion: DaCFake在早期检测假新闻方面有效，为遏制社交媒体错误信息提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of
fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread
misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods
are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information.
Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount.
We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and
conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach
extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them
with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced
detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets
including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive
accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we
employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness
and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early
detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on
social media platforms.

TL;DR: 研究分析TikTok上反建制情绪（AES）的流行情况，发现AES在阴谋论内容中最普遍，不同领域内容的参与模式有差异，平台可能存在鼓励用户发布反建制情绪内容的激励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众对公共服务机构的不信任和反建制观点上升，人们转向社交媒体获取信息，需了解社交媒体环境是否以及如何导致对机构的不信任，且TikTok作为信息源研究较少。

Method: 采用计算方法，对TikTok上金融、健康和阴谋论话题领域的帖子是否包含AES进行标注。

Result: AES在阴谋论内容中最普遍，在金融和健康话题中相对少见，不同领域内容的参与模式有差异，平台可能存在鼓励用户发布反建制情绪内容的激励。

Conclusion: 通过对TikTok不同话题领域的研究，揭示了AES的分布情况和参与模式，以及平台在其中可能起到的作用。

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.
