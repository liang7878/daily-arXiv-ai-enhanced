In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset. Together, our work offers starting points towards building practical, reliable retrieval AI tools for public defense, and towards more realistic legal retrieval benchmarks."}

This study investigates how different types of explanations can influence user trust in responses from retrieval-augmented generation systems. We conducted a controlled, two-stage user study where participants chose the more trustworthy response from a pair-one objectively higher quality than the other-both with and without one of three explanation types: (1) source attribution, (2) factual grounding, and (3) information coverage. Our results show that while explanations significantly guide users toward selecting higher quality responses, trust is not dictated by objective quality alone: Users' judgments are also heavily influenced by response clarity, actionability, and their own prior knowledge."}

A key challenge for improving RAG is to predict both the utility of retrieved documents -- quantified as the performance gain from using context over generation without context -- and the quality of the final answers in terms of correctness and relevance. In this paper, we define two prediction tasks within RAG. The first is retrieval performance prediction (RPP), which estimates the utility of retrieved documents. The second is generation performance prediction (GPP), which estimates the final answer quality. We hypothesise that in RAG, the topical relevance of retrieved documents correlates with their utility, suggesting that query performance prediction (QPP) approaches can be adapted for RPP and GPP. Beyond these retriever-centric signals, we argue that reader-centric features, such as the LLM's perplexity of the retrieved context conditioned on the input query, can further enhance prediction accuracy for both RPP and GPP. Finally, we propose that features reflecting query-agnostic document quality and readability can also provide useful signals to the predictions. We train linear regression models with the above categories of predictors for both RPP and GPP. Experiments on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset show that combining predictors from multiple feature categories yields the most accurate estimates of RAG performance."}

However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.\n  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments."}

Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches."}

JAXMg provides multi-GPU dense linear algebra for JAX, enabling Cholesky-based linear solves and symmetric eigendecompositions for matrices that exceed single-GPU memory limits. By interfacing JAX with NVIDIA's cuSOLVERMg through an XLA Foreign Function Interface, JAXMg exposes distributed GPU solvers as JIT-compatible JAX primitives.

As a result, there is growing demand for fast, accurate, and widely generalizable GPU performance models to support next-generation hardware selection and system-level exploration. However, current data-driven methods are limited, exhibiting poor generalization across hardware and inadequate modeling of complex production-level kernels common in modern inference stacks. To address these issues, we present SyncPerf, a unified GPU modeling framework. This approach first employs an analytical model to quantify a given kernel's demands on the GPU's heterogeneous instruction pipelines. These analytical features are then fed into a machine learning (ML) model to capture complex cross-pipeline interactions and resource dependencies, enabling high-fidelity performance prediction. Our evaluation across 11 GPU types from four generations of major architectures on two widely-used serving systems demonstrates that SyncPerf delivers high fidelity and strong generalizability. It achieves accurate predictions, with only 6.1% average error at the kernel level and 8.5% for end-to-end inference -- reducing the error of state-of-the-art methods by 6.7x and 4.4x, respectively. We also demonstrate SynPerf's value \"beyond simulation\" by utilizing its performance ceiling to diagnose implementation shortcomings and guide the optimization of a production fused MoE Triton kernel, achieving up to 1.7x speedup."}

Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset. Our method, dLLM, achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings on design-bench."}

Submitted to the European Journal of Operational Research", "summary": "The Conflict-Driven Cylindrical Algebraic Covering algorithm has proven well suited for performing theory validation checks in the satisfiability modulo theories paradigm for non-linear real arithmetic. CDCAC repurposes the theory underpinning classical cylindrical algebraic decomposition for SMT solving and is implemented in the SMT solvers cvc5 and SMT-RAT, as well as the computer algebra system Maple. It was previously observed that when using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for an SMT theory call, the output can be optimised by solving a single set covering problem instance that minimises the conflict clause. In this paper we consider the corresponding optimisation for CDCAC and observe that CDCAC naturally gives rise to multiple such optimisations within a single call. Each time a covering is generalised in one dimension, the resulting cell in the next dimension is labelled with theory constraints that cannot be satisfied together. We seek the smallest subset of constraints whose union covers all labels from the cells in the current covering. We call this optimisation problem a set covering problem with reasons. To simplify this problem, we introduce a data reduction step that generalises Beasley reduction for the classical set covering problem and show that this step alone solves many of the instances arising from SMT-LIB benchmarks. We then propose an exact solver based on linear programming to efficiently solve the remaining cases. Integrating these techniques into CDCAC has the potential to significantly improve SMT solver performance for non-linear real arithmetic problems."}

However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research."}

This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks."}

This is because optimal alignment with a reward function--whether via inference-time steering or fine-tuning--requires estimating the value function. This task demands access to the conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(x_1|x_t)$, the distribution of clean data $x_1$ consistent with an intermediate state $x_t$, a requirement that typically compels methods to resort to costly trajectory simulations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Meta Flow Maps (MFMs), a framework extending consistency models and flow maps into the stochastic regime. MFMs are trained to perform stochastic one-step posterior sampling, generating arbitrarily many i.i.d. draws of clean data $x_1$ from any intermediate state. Crucially, these samples provide a differentiable reparametrization that unlocks efficient value function estimation. We leverage this capability to solve bottlenecks in both paradigms: enabling inference-time steering without inner rollouts, and facilitating unbiased, off-policy fine-tuning to general rewards. Empirically, our single-particle steered-MFM sampler outperforms a Best-of-1000 baseline on ImageNet across multiple rewards at a fraction of the compute."}

While prior work has applied this concept to data valuation in machine learning, existing formulations overwhelmingly assume that each participant contributes a fixed, deterministic dataset. In practice, however, data owners often provide samples drawn from underlying probabilistic distributions, introducing stochasticity into their marginal contributions and rendering the Shapley value itself a random variable. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework for the Shapley value of probabilistic data distributions that quantifies both the expected contribution and the variance of each participant, thereby capturing uncertainty induced by random sampling. We develop theoretical and empirical methodologies for estimating these quantities: on the theoretical side, we derive unbiased estimators for the expectation and variance of the probabilistic Shapley value and analyze their statistical properties; on the empirical side, we introduce three Monte Carlo-based estimation algorithms - a baseline estimator using independent samples, a pooled estimator that improves efficiency through sample reuse, and a stratified pooled estimator that adaptively allocates sampling budget based on player-specific variability. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that these methods achieve strong accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, with the stratified pooled approach attaining substantial variance reduction at minimal additional cost. By extending Shapley value analysis from deterministic datasets to probabilistic data distributions, this work provides both theoretical rigor and practical tools for fair and reliable data valuation in modern stochastic data-sharing environments."}

Popularly used for non-crypto financial assets, GBM assumes Lognormal return distributions for a multi-asset cryptocurrency portfolio (XRP, SOL, ADA). This work utilizes Maximum Likelihood Estimation and a correlated Monte Carlo Simulation incorporating the Cholesky decomposition of historical covariance. We present our stock portfolio model as a Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP). We observe the model's structural shift within the heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian cryptocurrency environment. The results reveal limitations of the Lognormal assumption: the calculated Value-at-Risk at the 5% confidence level over the one-year horizon. For baselining our results, we also present a holistic comparative analysis with an equity portfolio (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA), demonstrating a significantly lower failure rate. This performance provides conclusive evidence that the GBM model is fundamentally the perfect benchmark for our subsequent works. Results from this novel work will be an indicator for the success criteria in our future model for crypto risk management, rigorously motivating the development and application of advanced models."}

The method explicitly parameterizes the missingness mechanism by modelling the probability of missingness as a function of classification uncertainty. To quantify classification uncertainty, we introduce margin confidence and incorporate the Aranda Ordaz (AO) link function to flexibly capture the asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning. The resulting uncertainty-aware framework delivers reliable classification performance in realistic MAR scenarios with substantial proportions of missing labels."}

Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are often used for this purpose due to their derivative free nature and robustness against local optima. In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.\n  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.\n  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings."}

This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation.

Building on our previous work, which defined and validated a multidimensional KPI framework for DAO sustainability, this paper moves from theory to practice by operationalising that framework in software infrastructure designed for finance and FinTech contexts. The system ingests governance and treasury data from major EVM networks, harmonises the outputs, and computes sustainability scores across four dimensions: participation, accumulated funds, voting efficiency, and decentralisation. A composite 0 to 12 score is then derived using transparent thresholds that are applied client-side in the browser.\n  Using a curated snapshot of more than 50 active DAOs covering 6,930 proposals and 317,317 unique voting addresses, we show how the platform surfaces recurring patterns such as persistently low participation and concentration of proposal activity. These results demonstrate how DAO Portal supports the diagnosis of governance risks and the comparison of design choices across DAOs. To promote reproducibility and adoption, we release source code, data schema, and dashboard implementation. By turning governance traces into measurable and explainable KPIs, DAO Portal provides auditable evidence of DAO sustainability and contributes software engineering infrastructure for financial applications where treasuries and decision-making rights involve significant assets."}

While this paradigm has accumulated a massive body of surrounding literature since its inception in the late '50s, we are still very much in the dark as far as basic computational questions are concerned, perhaps due to the intrinsic complexity of dynamic policies in this context. The latter feature forced earlier attempts to either study highly-structured classes of policies or to forgo provably-good performance guarantees altogether; to this day, rigorously analyzable results have been few and far between.\n  The current paper develops novel analytical foundations for directly competing against dynamic policies. Combined with further algorithmic progress and newly-gained insights, these ideas culminate in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for constantly-many commodities. In this regard, the efficient design of $ε$-optimal dynamic policies appeared to have been out of reach, since beyond their inherent algorithmic challenges, even the polynomial-space representation of such policies has been a fundamental open question."}

In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.\n  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses. Based on this empirical evidence, we make actionable recommendations for developers to harden their GitHub Actions workflows."}

When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance.

Jobs of the same color can be processed simultaneously by the machine. A job is covered if the machine is configured to its color during its whole processing interval. The goal of the machine is to maximize the sum of weights of all covered jobs, and the goal of each player is to place its jobs such that the sum of weights of covered jobs from its color is maximized. The study of this game is motivated by several applications like antenna scheduling for wireless networks.\n  We first show that given a strategy profile of the players, the machine scheduling problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then study the game from the players' point of view. We analyze the existence of Nash equilibria, its computation, and inefficiency. We distinguish between instances of the classical interval scheduling problem, in which every player controls a single job, and instances in which color sets may include multiple jobs."}

By taking advantage of the inherent randomness of wireless channels, Physical Layer Security (PLS) offers a promising paradigm; however, its efficacy in massive MIMO is heavily reliant on resource allocation and transmission strategies. In this work, the performance of secure transmission schemes, such as Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Artificial Noise (AN)-aided beamforming, is examined when passive eavesdroppers are present.

Even though this model has generated a vast body of literature over the last six decades, our algorithmic understanding has remained surprisingly limited. Indeed, for general problem instances, the best-known approximation guarantees have remained at a factor of $2$ since the mid-1990s. These guarantees were attained by the now-classic work of Anily [Operations Research, 1991] and Gallego, Queyranne, and Simchi-Levi [Operations Research, 1996] via the highly-structured class of \"stationary order sizes and stationary intervals\" (SOSI) policies, thereby avoiding direct competition against fully dynamic policies.\n  The main contribution of this paper resides in developing new analytical foundations and algorithmic techniques that enable such direct comparisons, leading to the first provable improvement over the $2$-approximation barrier. Leveraging these ideas, we design a constructive approach that allows us to balance cost and capacity at a finer granularity than previously possible via SOSI-based methods.

We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration.

An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones.

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning."}

We propose FedRD, a communication-efficient framework for federated risk difference estimation in distributed survival data. Unlike typical federated learning frameworks (e.g., FedAvg) that require persistent server connections and extensive iterative communication, FedRD is server-independent with minimal communication: one round of summary statistics exchange for the stratified model and three rounds for the unstratified model. Crucially, FedRD provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing--capabilities absent in FedAvg-based frameworks. We provide theoretical guarantees by establishing the asymptotic properties of FedRD and prove that FedRD (unstratified) is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis. Simulation studies and real-world clinical applications across different countries demonstrate that FedRD outperforms local and federated baselines in both estimation accuracy and prediction performance, providing an architecturally feasible solution for absolute risk assessment in privacy-restricted, multi-site clinical studies."}

We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes. These results offer practical insights for designing emotionally responsive virtual agents and digital platforms that sustain cooperation in the absence of physical presence."}

Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \\textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework. Our open-source toolkit enables reproducible evaluation and focuses on academic literature, providing the first comprehensive evaluation framework for citation prediction and serving as a methodological template for other scientific domains.

Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\\text{RDMA}^\\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{TSO}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios.

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types."}

Popularly used for non-crypto financial assets, GBM assumes Lognormal return distributions for a multi-asset cryptocurrency portfolio (XRP, SOL, ADA). This work utilizes Maximum Likelihood Estimation and a correlated Monte Carlo Simulation incorporating the Cholesky decomposition of historical covariance. We present our stock portfolio model as a Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP). We observe the model's structural shift within the heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian cryptocurrency environment. The results reveal limitations of the Lognormal assumption: the calculated Value-at-Risk at the 5% confidence level over the one-year horizon. For baselining our results, we also present a holistic comparative analysis with an equity portfolio (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA), demonstrating a significantly lower failure rate. This performance provides conclusive evidence that the GBM model is fundamentally the perfect benchmark for our subsequent works. Results from this novel work will be an indicator for the success criteria in our future model for crypto risk management, rigorously motivating the development and application of advanced models."}

Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks."}

However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes."}

The method explicitly parameterizes the missingness mechanism by modelling the probability of missingness as a function of classification uncertainty. To quantify classification uncertainty, we introduce margin confidence and incorporate the Aranda Ordaz (AO) link function to flexibly capture the asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning. The resulting uncertainty-aware framework delivers reliable classification performance in realistic MAR scenarios with substantial proportions of missing labels."}

In Phase 1, each group selects the position of one of its agents to serve as the group's representative location. In Phase 2, $k$ representatives are chosen as facility locations.

In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with strong preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals through their activation patterns. We then steer recommendations by adjusting the activations of the most biased neurons. Experiments on three public datasets with a sequential recommendation model demonstrate that PopSteer significantly enhances fairness with minimal impact on accuracy, while providing interpretable insights and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off."}

In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB.

We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations.

This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries.

This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build.\n  On HumanEval-Decompile for \\texttt{x86\\_64}, \\textsc{HELIOS} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\\% to 85.2\\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\\% to 89.6\\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \\textsc{HELIOS} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \\textsc{HELIOS} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets."}

We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios."}

Recent theory suggests that this happens because of a dimensionality bottleneck. This occurs when we force infinite linguistic nuances into small, fixed-length learned vectors. We developed NUMEN to break this bottleneck by removing the learning process entirely. Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors. This approach requires no training, supports an unlimited vocabulary, and allows the geometric capacity scale as needed. On the LIMIT benchmark, NUMEN achieves 93.90 % Recall@100 at 32,768 dimensions. This makes it the first dense retrieval model to officially surpass the sparse BM25 baseline 93.6 %.

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains."}

To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric."}

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions.

Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades.

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making."}

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness."}

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent.

POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p<0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778).

However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large-integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving. Compared to centralized ADMM and distributed ADMM implemented with Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a significant speedup ratio."}

However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead. Moreover, FastFI accurately identifies high-impact APIs and provides actionable guidance for call-site hardening."}

This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods."}

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence."}

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts."}

This emerging paradigm provides a powerful testbed for studying social dynamics and strategic behaviors among intelligent agents. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens. By organizing existing studies around the four key elements of game theory: players, strategies, payoffs, and information, we establish a systematic framework for understanding, comparing, and guiding future research on the design and analysis of LLM-based MAS."}

When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery."}

However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise.

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies.

Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making."}

To appear in The Web Conference 2026", "summary": "Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA"}

Online Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations. It contributes methodological transparency through open data and replication materials, and conceptual insight by relating observed communication patterns to principles of requirements communication. The findings offer evidence-based implications for how developers and RE practitioners can craft clearer and more effective explanations, potentially supporting fairer communication in both open and organizational contexts. From an RE perspective, these determinants can be interpreted as practical signals for ambiguity reduction and rationale articulation in day-to-day requirements communication."}

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\\%$ detection rate.

ICAI'25: 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence https://american-cse.org/csce2025/conferences-ICAI", "summary": "Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data."}

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of our method."}

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards."}

We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency.

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines."}

Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance.

We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence."}

In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost.

To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported. Our empirical findings validate that the proposed meta-learning-driven approach yielded the highest mean F1 score and proved to be effective for cross-domain settings."}

Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving."}

Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates."}

Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning.

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation."}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints."}

The framework naturally accommodates ensemble variants based on subsampling and also a two-stage bootstrap sampling scheme. Our treatment synthesizes and simplifies existing analyses, in particular recovering several results as special cases. The elementary nature of the arguments clarifies the close relationship between data-adaptive partitioning and kernel-type methods, providing an accessible approach to understanding the asymptotic behavior of tree-based methods."}

We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints. Cross-cutting challenges-such as outdated links, lack of awareness, and unclear guidance-affect both types of metadata. We further assess the robustness of our topic modeling pipeline across 30 runs (84% lexical and 89% semantic similarity) and validate topic quality with 23 expert raters (Randolph's kappa = 0.55). The study contributes empirical insights into PyPI's metadata practices and provides recommendations for improving them, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of our topic modeling approach for analyzing short-text survey responses."}

However, existing formulations rely on \\textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \\textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos. In addition, we adopt an incremental training strategy to progressively update the model components, effectively mitigating the instability of GAN training.

For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances."}

At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents.

This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs."}

We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation."}

We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers."}

Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse."}

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts."}

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics."}

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable."}

In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus.

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference."}

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments."}

To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \\textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome.

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events."}

This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline.

This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings.

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action."}

To appear in The Web Conference 2026", "summary": "Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles."}

AxiaBench enables the first large-scale, quantitative comparison of ten widely used evaluation methods across eight representative application domains.

This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain.

The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and perceived usability of RAG based chatbots in higher education, exploring their potential to enhance educational practices and outcomes as well as supporting the broader adoption of AI technologies in language specific educational contexts. Findings from this research are expected to contribute to the emerging field of AI driven education by demonstrating how intelligent systems can be effectively aligned with pedagogical goals."}

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains."}

However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.\n  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues."}

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways."}

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines."}

These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \\emph{unique}, \\emph{redundant}, and \\emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning."}

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance."}

To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions.

We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected.

The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue.

Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication.

Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success."}

Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments."}

To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime."}

Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging.

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines."}

This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations.

To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy.

Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes.

We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration."}

Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration.

We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead.

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation."}

Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls).

From this perspective, art history is reinterpreted as a recursive dynamic alternating between internal recursion within movements and meta-recursive transformations of their generative principles.\n  Artificial intelligence renders this logic technically explicit through learning loops, parameter updates, and code-level self-modification. To distinguish Recursivism from related notions such as generative art, cybernetics, process art, and evolutionary art, the article proposes three operational criteria: state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility. These concepts are examined through case studies including Refik Anadol, Sougwen Chung, Karl Sims, and the Darwin-Godel Machine. The article concludes by examining the aesthetic, curatorial, and ethical implications of self-modifying artistic systems."}

Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research."}

We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models."}

We first discuss three architectures for supporting UAV swarms - standalone, edge-enabled, and edge-cloud hybrid deployment - each optimized for varying autonomy and connectivity levels.

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability."}

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable."}

Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset. Our method, dLLM, achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot settings on design-bench."}

Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead."}

We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols."}

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data.

By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling."}

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event.

Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation."}

We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings."}

However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research."}

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards."}

To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior."}

To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged.

However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems."}

Third, the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to sequence length amplifies both data movement and compute overhead, making large-scale inference inefficient. To address these issues, this work introduces processing-in-memory solutions that restructure attention and feed-forward computation to minimize off-chip data transfers, dynamically compress and prune the KV cache to manage memory growth, and reinterpret attention as an associative memory operation to reduce complexity and hardware footprint. Moreover, we evaluate our processing-in-memory design against state-of-the-art accelerators and general-purpose GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency.

However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase."}

We further evaluate a unified method of entire-space stratified sampling from previous evaluatology research, and the results report that it consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tested domains.

This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area."}

Unlike typical federated learning frameworks (e.g., FedAvg) that require persistent server connections and extensive iterative communication, FedRD is server-independent with minimal communication: one round of summary statistics exchange for the stratified model and three rounds for the unstratified model. Crucially, FedRD provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing--capabilities absent in FedAvg-based frameworks. We provide theoretical guarantees by establishing the asymptotic properties of FedRD and prove that FedRD (unstratified) is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods."}

This misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination. To address this, we propose SearchGym, a simulation environment designed to bootstrap robust search agents. SearchGym employs a rigorous generative pipeline to construct a verifiable knowledge graph and an aligned document corpus, ensuring that every reasoning task is factually grounded and strictly solvable. Building on this controllable environment, we introduce SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning methodology that progressively optimizes agent policies through purified feedback, evolving from basic interactions to complex, long-horizon planning.

We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%.

Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases."}

Results: We introduce MARBLE, an execution-stable autonomous model refinement framework for bioinformatics models. MARBLE couples literature-aware reference selection with structured, debate-driven architectural reasoning among role-specialized agents, followed by autonomous execution, evaluation, and memory updates explicitly grounded in empirical performance.

We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings.

We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis."}

This task demands access to the conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(x_1|x_t)$, the distribution of clean data $x_1$ consistent with an intermediate state $x_t$, a requirement that typically compels methods to resort to costly trajectory simulations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Meta Flow Maps (MFMs), a framework extending consistency models and flow maps into the stochastic regime. MFMs are trained to perform stochastic one-step posterior sampling, generating arbitrarily many i.i.d. draws of clean data $x_1$ from any intermediate state. Crucially, these samples provide a differentiable reparametrization that unlocks efficient value function estimation. We leverage this capability to solve bottlenecks in both paradigms: enabling inference-time steering without inner rollouts, and facilitating unbiased, off-policy fine-tuning to general rewards.

LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct \"words\" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation. These findings indicate that part of apparent reasoning deficiency originates in the tokenizer layer, motivating tokenizer-level remedies before incurring the cost of training ever-larger models on ever-larger corpora."}

Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses."}

Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty."}

However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes."}

In this work, we propose Golden Eagle Genetic Optimization (GEGO), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates the population movement strategy of Golden Eagle Optimization with the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.\n  The main novelty of GEGO lies in embedding genetic operators directly into the iterative search process of GEO, rather than applying them as a separate evolutionary stage. This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.\n  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA.

As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications."}

Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly."}

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types."}

We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware.

Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design."}

Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas. We thoroughly analyze the executed ideas and training dynamics to facilitate future efforts towards execution-grounded automated AI research."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles."}

These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.\n  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models.

We propose FedRD, a communication-efficient framework for federated risk difference estimation in distributed survival data. Unlike typical federated learning frameworks (e.g., FedAvg) that require persistent server connections and extensive iterative communication, FedRD is server-independent with minimal communication: one round of summary statistics exchange for the stratified model and three rounds for the unstratified model. Crucially, FedRD provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing--capabilities absent in FedAvg-based frameworks. We provide theoretical guarantees by establishing the asymptotic properties of FedRD and prove that FedRD (unstratified) is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis.

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains."}

Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases."}

The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.\n  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $Ω(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable.

Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning. The resulting uncertainty-aware framework delivers reliable classification performance in realistic MAR scenarios with substantial proportions of missing labels."}

These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively.

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways."}

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively.

In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning."}

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point.

Applied to a separate counseling dataset and a pilot study with 62 counselors, RECAP reveals the prevalence of resistance, its negative impact on therapeutic relationships and demonstrates its potential to improve counselors' understanding and intervention strategies."}

Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a \"Yes\" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs."}

To improve the affordability and openness of TTM training, an open-source generative model backbone that is more training- and data-efficient is needed. In this paper, we constrain the number of trainable parameters in the generative model to match that of the MusicGen-small benchmark (with about 300M parameters), and replace its Transformer backbone with the emerging class of state-space models (SSMs). Specifically, we explore different SSM variants for sequence modeling, and compare a single-stage SSM-based design with a decomposable two-stage SSM/diffusion hybrid design. All proposed models are trained from scratch on a purely public dataset comprising 457 hours of CC-licensed music, ensuring full openness. Our experimental findings are three-fold. First, we show that SSMs exhibit superior training efficiency compared to the Transformer counterpart. Second, despite using only 9% of the FLOPs and 2% of the training data size compared to the MusicGen-small benchmark, our model achieves competitive performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests based on MusicCaps captions. Finally, our scaling-down experiment demonstrates that SSMs can maintain competitive performance relative to the Transformer baseline even at the same training budget (measured in iterations), when the model size is reduced to four times smaller.

To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric."}

While 3D Gaussian Splashing (3D-GS) offers unprecedented rendering speed and quality, current animation techniques often rely on a \"one-size-fits-all\" global tuning approach, where all Gaussian primitives are uniformly driven by a single expression code. This simplistic approach fails to unravel the distinct dynamics of different facial regions, such as deformable skin versus rigid teeth, leading to significant blurring and distortion artifacts. We introduce Conditionally-Adaptive Gaussian Avatars (CAG-Avatar), a framework that resolves this key limitation. At its core is a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module built on cross-attention. This mechanism empowers each 3D Gaussian to act as a query, adaptively extracting relevant driving signals from the global expression code based on its canonical position. This \"tailor-made\" conditioning strategy drastically enhances the modeling of fine-grained, localized dynamics. Our experiments confirm a significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity, particularly for challenging regions such as teeth, while preserving real-time rendering performance."}

We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications."}

Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets.

Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also discussed.

We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly."}

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.\n  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict.\n  For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\\times$ and API costs by 10$\\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS.\n  The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work."}

We model each agent as enforcing a distinct family of validity constraints on a shared solution state, and show that a MAS implements a factorized composition of constraint-enforcement operators. Under mild conditions, these dynamics converge to invariant solution sets defined by the intersection of agent constraint sets. Such invariant structures are generally not dynamically accessible to a single agent applying all constraints simultaneously, even when expressive capacity and information are identical. We extend this result from exact constraint enforcement to soft constraints via proximal operators, and apply the formalism to contemporary text-based dialog systems."}

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency."}

Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features. The proposed framework facilitates music genre classification by leveraging these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 78%, indicating the system's strong potential to enhance and streamline the organization of Bangla music genres."}

We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments. However, none of these approaches provides a reliable assessment of temporal cues - further indicating the pressing need for future research on temporal knowledge in T2I."}

Existing benchmarks are inadequate, as they are mostly limited to single long texts or rely on a \"sparse retrieval\" assumption-that answers can be derived from a few relevant chunks. This assumption fails for true corpus-level analysis, where evidence is highly dispersed across hundreds of documents and answers require global integration, comparison, and statistical aggregation. To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely. Our findings indicate that memory-augmented agentic architectures offer a more robust alternative, suggesting a critical shift is needed from simply extending context windows to developing advanced architectures for global information synthesis."}

While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++."}

Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead.

To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.\n  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone. The Translation-Aware Contamination Detection reliably exposes contamination even when English-only methods fail.

Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live.

RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information."}

Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that KRPO significantly outperforms strong baselines in the extraction F1 score."}

Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline.

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability."}

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making."}

To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating.

By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise.

We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex.

Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility.

This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows."}

The inability of IPAs to understand diverse accents including deaf speech renders them largely inaccessible to non-signing and speaking DHH individuals. Using an Echo Show, we compare the usability of natural language input via spoken English; with Alexa's automatic speech recognition and a Wizard-of-Oz setting with a trained facilitator re-speaking commands against that of a large language model (LLM)-assisted touch interface in a mixed-methods study. The touch method was navigated through an LLM-powered \"task prompter,\" which integrated the user's history and smart environment to suggest contextually-appropriate commands. Quantitative results showed no significant differences across both spoken English conditions vs LLM-assisted touch. Qualitative results showed variability in opinions on the usability of each method. Ultimately, it will be necessary to have robust deaf-accented speech recognized natively by IPAs."}

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results."}

Even when relevant information exists in the corpus, truncation can prevent compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to failures that are not captured by relevance-based evaluation. This paper studies retrieval from a structural perspective, modeling query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation.\n  We formalize retrieval as a sequence of candidate evidence sets and characterize conditions under which feasibility in the limit implies feasibility at finite retrieval depth. We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.\n  Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval."}

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards."}

Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the environment acting as a (possibly high-dimensional) instrument. When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent. We propose a GMM-type estimator based on cross-fold sample splitting of the instrument-covariate sample and prove that it is consistent as the number of environments grows but the sample size per environment remains constant. We further extend the method to sparse causal effects via $\\ell_1$-regularized estimation and post-selection refitting."}

While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains."}

Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure."}

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence."}

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.
