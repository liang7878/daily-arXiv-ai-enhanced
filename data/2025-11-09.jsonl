Most existing studies characterize this mapping by\ntraining models to directly encode visual stimuli into neural responses or\ndecode neural responses into visual stimuli. However, due to neural response\nvariability and limited neural recording techniques, these studies suffer from\noverfitting and lack generalizability. Motivated by this challenge, in this\npaper we shift the tasks from conventional direct encoding and decoding to\ndiscriminative encoding and decoding, which are more reasonable. And on top of\nthis we propose a cross-modal alignment approach, named Visual-Neural Alignment\n(VNA). To thoroughly test the performance of the three methods (direct\nencoding, direct decoding, and our proposed VNA) on discriminative encoding and\ndecoding tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on three invasive visual\ncortex datasets, involving two types of subject mammals (mice and macaques).\nThe results demonstrate that our VNA generally outperforms direct encoding and\ndirect decoding, indicating our VNA can most precisely characterize the above\nvisual-neural mapping among the three methods."}

To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training.

Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)\nagent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective\n(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against\nuser-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a\npre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a\nbenchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user\nintent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its\ninitial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining\nclassical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a\nrobust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable\nsolutions for urban mobility optimization."}

We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and\nflow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their\ntransferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory\ndatasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying\namounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that\ndiffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of\nthe Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently\noutperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual\ninspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from\npretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show\nweaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory\npatterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to\nsubstantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,\nenabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited\nhistorical records."}

We propose the\nQuadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel\nlow-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted\nleast squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term\nwhich majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.\nUnlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices\nwith prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive\nperformance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining\nfully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one\nexperiment where we are able to truncate $60\\%$ and $80\\%$ of the parameters of\na ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\\%$ and $~4\\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance\nrespectively.

The results show that LLMs generally\nalign more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative\nsample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and\naccountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs\nclaim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),\nrevealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These\nfindings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements\nengineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic\napproaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted\nsoftware development."}

In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries.

Further,\nhierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that\narchitectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait\nprofiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence\nof personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model\ntuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems.

CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that\nenforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never\npositively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the\nbaseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the\nmodel to find optimal solutions rather than just \"acceptable\" ones.

Submitted to The 1st International Conference on\n  AI Scientists (ICAIS 2025)", "summary": "PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on\nparameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional\nnumerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making\nparameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning\nadvances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural\noperators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution\noperators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two\nmain paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and\nexcel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,\nDeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.\nThrough comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and\nelectromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups\nof $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query\nscenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance\nfor method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,\nconvergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional\nparameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This\nwork establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers\nvia operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource\nfor this rapidly evolving field"}

Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems.

Mapping\nmethods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among\nobjects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical\nsoftware supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at\na single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships\nevolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework\nEvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts\ntraditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports\nmultiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling\n(MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).\nIt also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result\nevaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications.\nThis paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes\nthe architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application\nthrough an extensive usage example."}

Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC\n0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge\nsubstantially improved graph accuracy and orientation.

In this article we develop an ODE based method to\nstudy the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum\nparameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an\nasymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is\nreferred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic\npseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.\nIn particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm\nconverges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than\na local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.\n  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the\nAdam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show\nthat in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a\nLyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a\nconsequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima\ninfinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.MA"], "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}
