In our setting, agents have additive values, and the value each agent\nreceives from getting access to the goods in each period is drawn i.i.d. from\nsome joint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ (that can be arbitrarily correlated\nbetween agents). The principal also has global constraints on the set of goods\nthey can select over the horizon, which is represented via a submodular\nallocation-cost function. Our goal is to select the periods to allocate the\ngood to ensure high value for each group of agents.\n  We develop mechanisms for this problem using an artificial currency, where we\ngive each agent a budget proportional to their (exogenous) fair share. The\ncorrelated value distribution makes this an especially challenging problem, as\nagents may attempt to free-ride by declaring low valuations for the good when\nthey know other agents have high values-hoping those agents will bear a larger\nshare of the cost of the resource. We offer a black-box reduction from monetary\nmechanisms for the allocation of a costly excludable public good. We focus on\npacing strategies, the natural strategies when using AI agents, where agents\nreport a scaled version of their value to the mechanism. Our main results show\nthat when using a truthful monetary mechanism as our building block, the\nresulting online mechanism has a focal equilibrium in which each agent plays a\npacing strategy whose outcome results in an allocation that is a\n$(\\mathcal{H}_n-1)$-approximation of the core, where $\\mathcal{H}_n$ is the\nHarmonic number, and $n$ is the number of agents. Remarkably, we are able to\nachieve an approximate core solution as a Nash outcome without explicit\ncollaboration or coordination between the agents."}

We investigate how a principal -- who\nobserves the true state of the world -- can strategically shape these beliefs\nthrough Bayesian persuasion to induce stable matching that maximizes a desired\nutility. Due to the general intractability of the underlying matching\noptimization problem as well as the multi-receiver persuasion problem, our main\nconsiderations are two important special cases: (1) when agents can be\ncategorized into a small number of types based on their value functions, and\n(2) when the number of possible world states is small.

Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging\nRISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom\ncomputation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom\nGPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing\nfor hybrid HDC-CNN workloads. Experimental results using four types of custom\nHDC instructions show a performance improvement of up to 56.2 times in\nmicrobenchmark tests, demonstrating the potential of RISC-V GPUs for\nenergy-efficient, high-performance computing."}

However, in many practical scenarios,\nlimited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the\nepistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic\nuncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we\nredefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the\nperformance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with\nfull knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for\na given input exceeds a specified rejection cost.

For example, they may want to\ndetermine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a\nconfiguration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the\ncode mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this\nproblem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file\ninstead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other\ntechniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g.,\nmethods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces\nCodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is\nindependent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a\ncode region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another\ncommit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by\nanalyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code\nfragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating\nsimilarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two\nnew hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular\nprogramming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target\nregion in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available\nbaselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points."}

We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)\nfrom a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and\naccelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available\ndata lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for\ndeployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We\nthen study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that\nwhile standard supervised training fails when either distribution has\ninsufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual\ndistributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual\npretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find\nthat KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,\nachieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data.

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it\nremains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of\ntheir responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain\nsampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably\nwell-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain\nquestion-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base\nLLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own\ndistribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We\nstate three implications of this prediction, which we validate through\nexperiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across\nquestion-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this\ncalibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration.

To address these\nchallenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as\na method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a\nsmaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree\nto which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal\nrepresentations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current\naccuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality\nand often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity\nbetween the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically\nshow that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,\nresulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,\nwhich is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we\npropose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically\nevaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student\nmodels under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate\nMetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular\nlanguage models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation\ntechniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress\nidentifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring\nthe need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation\npipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing\ncompressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}

To address this challenge, prior works have\nexplored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from\nperformance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce\nPuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high\naccuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE\nperforms sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy\nand specialization.

Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary\nmasks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses\nunderutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up\nto 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks.

Specifically, we\npose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of\ntracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is\nwell-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly\nevaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a\ndeeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human\nperformances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such\nmodels.

In this work, we systematically investigate\nthe performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and\nreasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals\ncritical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's\npre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below\nbaseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate\nsufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective\nself-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in\ndetermining success.

For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,\nnon-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The\nadvent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a\npromising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for\nperceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for\nthis classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural\nReconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the\nprinciple of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition\nfor faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based\nframework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction\nthrough an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,\na Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid\nTraining Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous\nexperiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,\nindividual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries.

Although these approaches result in impressive reductions\nin compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically\nin-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute\ntradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications\nrequire more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency\nand memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that\nartificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent\nstate update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at\nspecific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design\nprocess, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &\nAttend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two\nsimple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of\ntokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression\nresults in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and\nmemory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for\nefficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,\nunlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without\nany retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture.

Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise).

Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs\nwith low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably\ninduced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware\nbehavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation\nspace, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that\nself-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent\nrepresentations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral\nself-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily\ninduced and modulated."}

Cognitive\nscreening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief\nsnapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by\ncontinuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether\nphysiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive\ntests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23\nolder adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess\nworking memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a\nwearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature,\nand movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and\nsegmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated\npredictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results:\nOur models showed strong performance with Spearman's \\rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean\nabsolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean\npredictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement\nand temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin\nconductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with\nskin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These\nfindings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised\nlearning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive\nfunctions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study\ndemonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This\napproach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions."}
