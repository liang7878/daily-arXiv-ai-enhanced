It\nis a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually.\nAn effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing\nparts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization\nschemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new\nalgorithm, which we name \\textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for\nreinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm\nto continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that\nreinitialize units in the network.

In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only\nthe vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem\nallowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have\npreferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings\nis how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires\nexponential time if the definition is simply applied.

Subsequent simplifications of this\nrepresentation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a\nsmaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the\nproof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron\nnetworks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical\ndirection of most modern neural networks.\n  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an\nalternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear\nactivations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis\nspline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and\nsigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works\nhave explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we\npropose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in\nthe Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of\nlearnable frequencies.

Casey", "Edith Elkind"], "title": "Justified Representation: From Hare to Droop", "categories": ["cs.GT"], "comment": null, "summary": "The study of proportionality in multiwinner voting with approval ballots has\nreceived much attention in recent years. Typically, proportionality is captured\nby variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive\ngroups of at least $\\ell\\cdot\\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number\nof voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\\ell$\nrepresentatives. The quantity $\\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the\nsocial choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the\nDroop quota, defined as $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{k+1}\\rfloor+1$. This quota is often\nused in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single\nTransferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's\nProportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of\napproval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The\ncontribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting\nrules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare\nquota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR,\nPJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of\nthis axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the\ncorresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it\nis necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult\nto satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the\nfrontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical\nresults with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models\nof voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard\n(Hare) JR/EJR+.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7528Droop\u914d\u989d\u66ff\u4ee3Hare\u914d\u989d\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684JR\u5f0f\u516c\u7406\u53ca\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u6807\u51c6JR\u516c\u7406Droop\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u4f5c\u8005\u8003\u8651\u5728\u6279\u51c6\u6295\u7968\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Droop\u914d\u989d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6JR\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176Droop\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4fee\u6539\u5df2\u77e5\u89c4\u5219\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4fee\u6539\u5df2\u6709\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u6807\u51c6JR\u516c\u7406Droop\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u9009\u6c11\u6279\u51c6\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDroop JR/EJR+\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\uff08Hare\uff09JR/EJR+\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u5f97\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u516c\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on\nuninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals,\nwhich can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference,\nenvironmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation,\ncollision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarnRaft, a\nblockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining\ncoordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied\nconditions. SwarnRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable\ndistributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and\nheading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes.

Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score,\nand precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM)\nemerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are\nwidely used to ensure model stability and generalizability.\n  This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for\naddressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and\npractitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By\nidentifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML\nadoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5176\u7ba1\u9053\u5065\u58ee\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5982SMOTE\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSZZ\u7b97\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u5e38\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6709AUC\u3001F1 - score\u7b49\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e3e\u7b49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep.

In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under\nupdates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive\nand realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static\nvalidation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph\nthat validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given\nupdate sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for\nreasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds\nthe update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under\nupdates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor\nextension of) SHACL.

Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices.

Membership inference (MI) has recently emerged as an\neffective tool for assessing privacy risk by identifying whether specific data\nbelong to a model's training set. In parallel, model compression techniques,\nespecially quantization, have gained traction for reducing computational costs\nand enabling the deployment of large models. However, while quantized models\nstill retain knowledge learned from the original training data, it remains\nunclear whether quantization affects their ability to retain and expose privacy\ninformation. Answering this question is of great importance to understanding\nprivacy risks in real-world deployments. In this work, we conduct the first\nempirical study on how quantization influences task performance and privacy\nrisk simultaneously in LLMs4Code. To do this, we implement widely used\nquantization techniques (static and dynamic) to three representative model\nfamilies, namely Pythia, CodeGen, and GPTNeo. Our results demonstrate that\nquantization has a significant impact on reducing the privacy risk relative to\nthe original model.

Topographic constraints in\nneural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different\nimpacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such\ndifferent implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end,\nhere we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two\nspatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to\ndevelop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which\nenforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared\nto both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved\nrobustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)\ngreater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)\nstronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations\npositioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in\norientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,\nindicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational\ngeometry of the network.

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark.

With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for\nreliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine\nvarious open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation\nafter instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards\nlabel smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for\noverconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing\nis sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process.

With the rise of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model\ngeneration.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions.

The\ncurrent literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning\nmodels to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high\nmisclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational\nexpense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these\ndrawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked\nensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses\nadvanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model\nrobustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal\nwith class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an\nensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose\ncomplementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided\nmodel demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%,\nCohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and\nefficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice\n(training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local\nInterpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate\ntransparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high\nconcentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important\nobservations of liver disease.

Objective: Understand what\npower-related phenomena occur in pair programming as it is used in industry;\ngive advice to practitioners on how to do better pair programming. Method:\nAnalyze 22 industrial pair programming sessions using Grounded Theory\nMethodology. Formulate a Grounded Theory on power-related behaviors. Run a\nsurvey with 292 participants about that theory. Use it to demonstrate that the\nphenomena are common. Results: Our theory describes the phenomenon of Power\nGap: a perceived difference in participation opportunities. The theory shows\nthe behaviors that create a Power Gap or result from it. Power Gaps tend to\ndamage knowledge transfer, code quality, and process effi ciency. The survey\nresults show that all concepts from our theory are frequent in practice. They\nalso provide more grounding for concepts that are observable only indirectly.\nConclusions: It is a valuable component of pair programming skill to be able to\navoid Power Gaps.

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively.

To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving\nits efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model\nDistillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER.

However, for\nlarge-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user\nfeedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics.

Despite the widespread use of\nthis technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in\nterms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims:\nThis study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and\nhuman-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding\ntasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and\nSonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions.

Existing notions of conformance\nchecking for process models focus on verifying process execution traces and\nlack the expressiveness and automation needed for semantic model comparison,\nleaving this question unresolved. We integrate our approach into a broader\nsemantic framework for defining reference model conformance. We outline an\nalgorithm for reference process model conformance checking, evaluate it through\na case study, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

This paper presents findings from a\nmixed-methods study examining how developers perceive AI's influence across the\ndimensions of the SPACE framework: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity,\nCollaboration and Efficiency. Drawing on survey responses from over 500\ndevelopers and qualitative insights from interviews and observational studies,\nwe find that AI is broadly adopted and widely seen as enhancing productivity,\nparticularly for routine tasks. However, the benefits vary, depending on task\ncomplexity, individual usage patterns, and team-level adoption.

Using data from\none million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of\nmultiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning.\nEmploying the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation,\nwe assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance\npolicies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness,\nsession completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a\nsuitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second\nattempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the\nresulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant\nimprovements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the\noverall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit\n(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on\nindividual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using\ncausal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across\nstudents and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect\nheterogeneity, outperform MAB policies.

However, extracting effective\nfeatures outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains\nchallenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between\nclasses. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based\nOut-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD\nfeatures and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models.\nBOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset,\nselects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to\ncross the decision boundary to form OOD features.

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further\nincorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing\nenvironments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies\n(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to\nachieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able\nto minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions\nsimultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.\nMoreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,\nand develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of\ncomposite functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u590d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u79cd\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e14\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u7531\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8c\u9636\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f11\u7720\u4e13\u5bb6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u79cd\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u5728\u8f6e\u6b21\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u590d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9057\u61be\u3002"}}

But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions.

To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with\nthree datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)\nKinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural\nvideo datasets.

Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies.

However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u666e\u904d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa NeGPR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u3001\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6297\u566a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa NeGPR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u8f7b\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNeGPR \u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 12.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "NeGPR \u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In the context of complex, nonlinear\nfinite element modeling environments, this can become computationally\nchallenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to\nbalance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand\nassociated with the development of the low-fidelity model.

Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0", "summary": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use.

However, compared with traditional\nwireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude\noperations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it\nmore vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some\nlarge artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure\ncommunications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security\nrisks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we\nintroduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in\naddressing these challenges.

A vector can be written as a linear\ncombination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively\napplying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector\nexpressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$\nprincipal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,\nwriting a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of\nthe vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based\ndenoising.\n  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$\n(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the\ntraining sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire\ndatasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network\nhead to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the\nquantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional\nprobability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and\npotentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training\nlarge-scale models.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists.

We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics\nclinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and\nBIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)\nblock that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;\nand (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent\nspace alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding\ndomain knowledge into the training process.

By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a\ndemonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by\nthe model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets.

We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these\ndetectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on\nzero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot\ngenerations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we\nintroduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models\n(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on\none-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific\ncontinued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all\nparameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG\ntext detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential\nvulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our\nown classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\noptimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While\nBCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL\ntest set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts.

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories.

Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed\nbenchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in\norder to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral\nbiometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5934\u50cf\u4ecb\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u5192\u540d\u9876\u66ff\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7528GAGAvatar\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5192\u540d\u5934\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u9762\u90e8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u624b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAUC\u503c\u63a5\u8fd180%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between\nthe audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop\nan efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional\nguidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video\ngeneration in a training-free manner.
