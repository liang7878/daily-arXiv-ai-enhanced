The design and\nimplementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical\nexpertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable\nreasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear\nto what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and\nexecution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark\ncomposed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning\n1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these\npipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,\nrequiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,\nstatistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a\nhigh-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation\nmodels using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to\ndecompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and\nsynthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on\nKRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving\nwell-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data\nprocessing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data\nscience pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short.

Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edfQUITE\u8fdb\u884cSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800cLLM\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u7528LLM\u91cd\u5199SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7531\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u91cd\u5199\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "QUITE\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e35.8%\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u591a\u4ea7\u751f24.1%\u91cd\u5199\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684QUITE\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5c06SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In our model, an agent may strategically\nmisreport the proposed element's utility, unlike the standard delegated choice\nproblem which assumes that the agent truthfully reports the utility for the\nproposed alternative. Thus, the principal needs to inspect the proposed element\npossibly along with other alternatives to maximize its own utility, given an\nexogenous cost of inspecting each element. Further, the delegation itself\nincurs a fixed cost, thus the principal can decide whether to delegate or not\nand inspect by herself.\n  We show that DCIC indeed is a generalization of PNOI where the side\ninformation from a strategic agent is available at certain cost, implying its\nNP-hardness by Fu, Li, and Liu (STOC'23). We first consider a costless\ndelegation setting in which the cost of delegation is free. We prove that the\nmaximal mechanism over the pure delegation with a single inspection and an PNOI\npolicy without delegation achieves a $3$-approximation for DCIC with costless\ndelegation, which is further proven to be tight. These results hold even when\nthe cost comes from an arbitrary monotone set function, and can be improved to\na $2$-approximation if the cost of inspection is the same for every element.

This is\nparticularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting\npatterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on\nhistorical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of\ntime-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets\nand applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across\nfinancial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown\nboosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and\nfine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial\ndata within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to\ninherently different time-series patterns across domains.

Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive\nlearning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that\naligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,\nthe application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to\nsubstantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to\nnatural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of\nperturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent\nspace.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose an extension that incorporates a\nsinusoidal, time-varying mean reversion speed, allowing the model to reflect\ncyclic interest rate dynamics more effectively.\n  The model is calibrated using a comprehensive dataset of daily U.S. Treasury\nyield curves obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database,\ncovering the period from January 1990 to December 2022. The dataset includes\ntenors of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years, with the most recent yields\nranging from 1.22% (1-year) to 2.36% (30-year).\n  Calibration is performed using the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm, and\nMonte Carlo simulations with 200 paths and a time step of 0.05 years.

Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk\nor Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and\nits role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and\nbuying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual\nin the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that\nencodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.\nThe population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.\nRecombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation\nis applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The\nevaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that\nconsiders the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community\nlevel, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the\ndegradation of microgrids batteries.

A central question in this setting is\nwhether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be\n(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its\nsample complexity.

To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training\nmethod that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring\nadditional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the\ncurrent RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal\npreference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing\ntraining data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.\nThis process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.\nExperimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to\nconsistent improvements in both models.

Our main\ncontribution is the design of a new online algorithm, termed Forward-Looking\nBALANCE (FLB), and using primal-dual framework to establish that it is\n(asymptotically) optimal-competitive.\n  This meta-algorithm has two main primitives: (i) keeping track of the\ncapacity used for each server at each time and applying a penalty function to\nthis quantity, and (ii) adjusting the reward of assigning a job to a server by\nsubtracting the total penalty of a particularly chosen subset of future times,\nin contrast to just looking at the current time. The FLB algorithm then assigns\nthe arriving job to the server with the maximum adjusted reward. If R and D are\nthe ratios of maximum over minimum rewards and durations, we show that the FLB\nalgorithm obtains an asymptotic competitive ratio of\nln(RD)+3lnln(max(R,D))+O(1).

While\nthe CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical\ncorrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem\nfrom a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under\ndiverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction\nbefore usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging\nthe tables offers only marginal improvement.\n  We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem\ncalled the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a\nset-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two\nbranch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other\nby folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in\nan H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's\nsustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which\nTAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache,\nand perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher\nfidelity on the H2P tail.

However, existing PFL methods often require\nincreased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily\ndue to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has\nlinear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local\ncomputation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search\nfor personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is\nsecond-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,\nemploying it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.\nIn this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order\noptimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and\nenhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first\ncomputes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based\nnormalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating\nclient-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher\nInformation Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as\nan approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models.

This is\ncalled the $F_p$ moment of the trimmed vector. Trimmed measures are used in\nrobust estimation, as seen in the R programming language's `trim.var' function\nand the `trim' parameter in the mean function. Linear sketches improve time and\nmemory efficiency and are applicable to streaming and distributed settings. We\ninitiate the study of sketching these statistics and give a new condition for\ncapturing their space complexity. When $k \\ge n/poly\\log n$, we give a linear\nsketch using $poly(1/\\varepsilon, \\log n)$ space which provides a $(1 \\pm\n\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the top-$k$ $F_p$ moment for $p \\in [0,2]$. For\ngeneral $k$, we give a sketch with the same guarantees under a condition\nrelating the $k$-th largest frequency to the tail mass, and show this condition\nis necessary. For the $k$-trimmed version, our sketch achieves optimal error\nguarantees under the same condition. We extend our methods to $p > 2$ and also\naddress related problems such as computing the $F_p$ moment of frequencies\nabove a threshold, finding the largest $k$ such that the $F_p$ moment of the\ntop $k$ exceeds $k^{p+1}$, and the $F_p$ moment of the top $k$ frequencies such\nthat each entry is at least $k$.

The review systematically analyzes\ndiverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal\ncontrol) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).\nEnabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation\nmodels, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.\nDespite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM\nlimitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,\nbias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety\nassurance.

A key challenge is the long-tail problem,\nwhere extreme data sparsity and cold-start issues limit the performance of\ntraditional recommendation methods. To address this, we propose a novel\nlong-tail product recommendation mechanism that integrates product text\ndescriptions and user behavior sequences using a large-scale language model\n(LLM). First, we introduce a semantic visor, which leverages a pre-trained LLM\nto convert multimodal textual content such as product titles, descriptions, and\nuser reviews into meaningful embeddings. These embeddings help represent\nitem-level semantics effectively. We then employ an attention-based user intent\nencoder that captures users' latent interests, especially toward long-tail\nitems, by modeling collaborative behavior patterns.

It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this\ncollaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For\nexample, the prefix \"co\" is used interchangeably to represent both\n\"collaborative\" and \"mutual,\" and the terms \"co-learning\" and \"co-adaptation\"\nare sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle\ndifferences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary\nresearch question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this\ncollaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this\nhuman-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we\nare also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task\ndomains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration\nis significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent\ninteractions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can\nalso help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different\ntask domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,\ncomplex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive\ntheories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure\nhuman-agent co-learning and co-adaptation.

On\nthe other hand, #DNF $\\in$ spanL and spanL $\\not\\subseteq$ #P unless NL = NP.\nHence, the class of functions logspace-reducible to #DNF is a strict subset of\n#P under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions. By contrast, we show that\ntwo calls to a (restricted) #2DNF oracle suffice to capture gapP, namely, that\nthe logspace many-one closure of the subtraction between the results of two\n#2DNF calls is gapP. Because #P $\\not\\subseteq$ gapP, #P is strictly contained\nbetween one and two #2DNF oracle calls.\n  Surprisingly, the propositional formulas needed in both calls are linear-time\ncomputable, and the reduction preserves interesting structural as well as\nsymmetry properties, leading to algorithmic applications. We show that a single\nsubtraction suffices to compensate for the absence of negation while still\ncapturing gapP, i.e., our results carry over to the monotone fragments of #2SAT\nand #2DNF. Since our reduction is linear-time, it preserves sparsity and, as a\nconsequence we obtain a sparsification lemma for both #2SAT and #2DNF. This has\nonly been known for kSAT with k $\\geq$ 3 and respective counting versions. We\nfurther show that both #2DNF calls can be combined into a single call if we\nallow a little postprocessing (computable by AC0- or TC0-circuits).\nConsequently, we derive refined versions of Toda's Theorem: PH $\\subseteq$\n[#MON2SAT]$^{log}_{TC0}$ = [#MON2DNF]$^{log}_{TC0}$ and PH $\\subseteq$\n[#IMPL2SAT]$^{log}_{AC0}$.

It has also become an umbrella term for processing in modern\nscientific applications. Today, many scientific applications can be considered\nas workflows made of multiple dependent steps, and hundreds of workflow\nmanagement systems (WMSs) have been developed to manage and run these\nworkflows. However, no turnkey solution has emerged to address the diversity of\nscientific processes and the infrastructure on which they are implemented.\nInstead, new research problems requiring the execution of scientific workflows\nwith some novel feature often lead to the development of an entirely new WMS. A\ndirect consequence is that many existing WMSs share some salient features,\noffer similar functionalities, and can manage the same categories of workflows\nbut also have some distinct capabilities. This situation makes researchers who\ndevelop workflows face the complex question of selecting a WMS. This selection\ncan be driven by technical considerations, to find the system that is the most\nappropriate for their application and for the resources available to them, or\nother factors such as reputation, adoption, strong community support, or\nlong-term sustainability. To address this problem, a group of WMS developers\nand practitioners joined their efforts to produce a community-based terminology\nof WMSs. This paper summarizes their findings and introduces this new\nterminology to characterize WMSs. This terminology is composed of fives axes:\nworkflow characteristics, composition, orchestration, data management, and\nmetadata capture. Each axis comprises several concepts that capture the\nprominent features of WMSs.

A well-established approach is using\nautoencoders to extract latent representations at the network's compression\npoint. These representations are valuable because they retain essential\ninformation necessary for reconstructing the original input from the compressed\nlatent space. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective.\nInstead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful\nglobal information at each frequency level, making individual frequency\ncomponents useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with\nmultidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling\nselective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in\nthe computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in\ntheir frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently\ncontain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies\nrather than the entire spectrum. These characteristics position the DFT as a\nviable learning objective for representation learning and we validate our\napproach by achieving 52.8% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 and\noutperforming the traditional autoencoder by 12.8 points under identical\narchitectural configurations.

The mobile design usually\nconsists of design mock-ups that specify (1) the expected screen appearances\n(e.g., widget layouts, colors, and shapes) and (2) the expected screen\nbehaviors, regarding how one screen can transition into another (e.g., labeled\nwidgets with textual description). Given a design mock-up and the\nimplementation of its application, GUIPilot reports both their screen\ninconsistencies as well as process inconsistencies. On the one hand, GUIPilot\ndetects the screen inconsistencies by abstracting every screen into a widget\ncontainer where each widget is represented by its position, width, height, and\ntype. By defining the partial order of widgets and the costs of replacing,\ninserting, and deleting widgets in a screen, we convert the screen-matching\nproblem into an optimizable widget alignment problem. On the other hand, we\ntranslate the specified GUI transition into stepwise actions on the mobile\nscreen (e.g., click, long-press, input text on some widgets). To this end, we\npropose a visual prompt for the vision-language model to infer widget-specific\nactions on the screen. By this means, we can validate the presence or absence\nof expected transitions in the implementation. Our extensive experiments on 80\nmobile applications and 160 design mock-ups show that (1) GUIPilot can achieve\n94.5% precision and 99.6% recall in detecting screen inconsistencies,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art approach, such as GVT, by 66.2% and 56.6%\nrespectively, and (2) GUIPilot reports zero errors in detecting process\ninconsistencies.

However, the fact of instrumental\nconvergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining\nabsolute or near-absolute power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6743\u529b\u8ffd\u6c42\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6743\u529b\u662f\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u8bf4\u6cd5\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9053\u7406\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u7edd\u5bf9\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u7edd\u5bf9\u6743\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u66f4\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u56de\u5e94\u5173\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdbAI\u707e\u96be\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u53ca\u6743\u529b\u8ffd\u6c42\u8bf4\u6cd5\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6743\u529b\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6743\u529b\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6743\u529b\u662f\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9053\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u65e0\u4e3b\u4f53\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u80fd\u6309\u6743\u529b\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6743\u529b\u662f\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u7edd\u5bf9\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u7edd\u5bf9\u6743\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002"}}

Can one entirely explain\nthe volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders\nthat mechanically impact prices? We introduce a new theoretical framework to\ndescribe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact\nprices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show\nthat, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the\nlong memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for\nthe effect of strongly fluctuating volumes $q$ of individual trades, we further\nintroduce two $q$-dependent exponents, which allows us to account for the way\nthe moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price\nchanges and generalized order flow imbalance scales with $T$. We predict in\nparticular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion\non a parameter $a$ that allows one to put the same weight on all child orders\nor overweight large orders, a behaviour clearly borne out by empirical data.

This construction represents the first $o(\\log k)$ upper bound for\nthis problem. We complement this result by showing that there exist infinitely\nmany values of $k$ for which any DNF or CNF representation requires at least\n$\\Omega(\\log\\log k)$ terms or clauses. These results have significant\nimplications for the efficiency of model counting algorithms based on formula\ntransformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709k\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\u7684DNF\u6216CNF\u516c\u5f0f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u9879\uff08\u6216\u5b50\u53e5\uff09\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u5e38\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65e0\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u51fa\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709k\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\u7684DNF\u6216CNF\u516c\u5f0f\u6240\u9700\u6700\u5c11\u9879\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5f97\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u6570k\uff0c\u53ef\u6784\u9020\u9879\u6570\u6700\u591a\u4e3aO(\u221a(log k)loglog k)\u7684\u5355\u8c03DNF\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u591a\u4e2ak\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u4f55DNF\u6216CNF\u8868\u793a\u81f3\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u03a9(loglog k)\u9879\u6216\u5b50\u53e5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709k\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d4b\u503c\u7684DNF\u516c\u5f0f\u9879\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3aO(\u221a(log k)loglog k)\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u591a\u4e2ak\u4f7fDNF\u6216CNF\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9879\u6570\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a\u03a9(loglog k)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5f0f\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

When applied in wireless networks, two issues\nconsistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices\nand limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling\nstrategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data\nheterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that\nthe convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and\nsample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers\nto the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of\nthe individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper\nbounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total\nnumber of samples scheduled for local update.

This unconditional rejection of\nnon-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in\nthe whole search tree.

Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a paradigm to pick\nmaximally informative designs that has been increasingly applied to such\nproblems. During training, BOED selects inputs according to a pre-determined\nacquisition criterion. During testing, the model learned during training\nencounters a naturally occurring distribution of test samples. This leads to an\ninstance of covariate shift, where the train and test samples are drawn from\ndifferent distributions. Prior work has shown that in the presence of model\nmisspecification, covariate shift amplifies generalization error. Our first\ncontribution is to provide a mathematical decomposition of generalization error\nthat reveals key contributors to generalization error in the presence of model\nmisspecification. We show that generalization error under misspecification is\nthe result of, in addition to covariate shift, a phenomenon we term error\n(de-)amplification which has not been identified or studied in prior work. Our\nsecond contribution is to provide a detailed empirical analysis to show that\nmethods that result in representative and de-amplifying training data increase\ngeneralization performance. Our third contribution is to develop a novel\nacquisition function that mitigates the effects of model misspecification by\nincluding a term for representativeness and implicitly inducing\nde-amplification.

We evaluated single agent systems\n(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized\nmodels for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,\nprocess adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while\nmulti-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the\ncomponent-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and\nexcellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly\nunderperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent\nsystem).

Catalogs of architectural anti-patterns have been proposed\nto highlight the negative aspects of flawed microservice design.

Method: We leveraged a dataset of 25\nmicroservice networks and several network hub detection techniques to identify\nthe Hub-like anti-pattern, namely scale-free property, centrality metrics and\nclustering coefficient, minimum description length principle, and the approach\nbehind the Arcan tool. Results and Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the\nstudied architectural networks are not scale-free, that most considered hub\ndetection approaches do not agree on the detected hubs, and that the method by\nKirkley leveraging the Erdos-Renyi encoding is the most accurate one in terms\nof the number of detected hubs and the detection precision. Investigating\nfurther the applicability of these methods to detecting Hub-like components in\nmicroservice-based and other systems opens up new research directions.\nMoreover, our results provide an evaluation of the approach utilized by the\nwidely used Arcan tool and highlight the potential to update the tool to use\nthe normalized degree centrality of a component in the network, or for the\napproach based on ER encoding to be adopted instead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u627e\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u53cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Kirkley\u57fa\u4e8eErdos - Renyi\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u5230\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u6570\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5019\u9009\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u752825\u4e2a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5fc3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5982\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u6307\u6807\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\u539f\u5219\u53caArcan\u5de5\u5177\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u662f\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u7684\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0cKirkley\u57fa\u4e8eErdos - Renyi\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30Arcan\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, the nature of model aggregation at\nthe centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of\nnon-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally\non more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all\nclients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data\nnecessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the\nserver. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent\nutilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize\nthe amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.\nSpecifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the\nlocal performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for\neach class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local\ntraining. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized\npartition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the\nclient utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its\nperformance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of\naggregation.

Red teaming--a\nsystematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful\nresponses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.\nWithin this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for\ncomprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to\nred-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue\ndiversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding\nsimilarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.\nSecond, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts\ncoverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper\nintroduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to\naddress these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through\nbehavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an\nopen-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers\ncapable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk\ncategories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks\nthat are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target\nLLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5.

Crucially, the\ntokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference\nas well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the\ntoken vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the\ntokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the\ncanonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest\nthat large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,\nand this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show\nthat, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate\n(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive\ngeneration process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical\nresult, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method\nthat precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.\nFurther, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the\ndistribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably\ncloser to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u786e\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u9700\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff08\u90e8\u5206\uff09\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u91c7\u6837\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u8303\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u975e\u89c4\u8303\u8bcd\u5143\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

As their integration\ninto workflows deepens, ensuring robustness against vulnerabilities especially\nthose triggered by diverse or adversarial inputs becomes increasingly\nimportant. Such vulnerabilities may lead to incorrect or insecure code\ngeneration when models encounter perturbed task descriptions, code, or\ncomments. Prior research often overlooks the role of natural language in\nguiding code tasks. This study investigates how adversarial perturbations in\nnatural language inputs including prompts, comments, and descriptions affect\nLLMs for Code (LLM4Code). It examines the effects of perturbations at the\ncharacter, word, and sentence levels to identify the most impactful\nvulnerabilities. We analyzed multiple projects (e.g., ReCode, OpenAttack) and\ndatasets (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP), establishing a taxonomy of adversarial\nattacks. The first dimension classifies the input type code, prompts, or\ncomments while the second dimension focuses on granularity: character, word, or\nsentence-level changes. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining\nquantitative performance metrics with qualitative vulnerability analysis.\nLLM4Code models show varying robustness across perturbation types.\nSentence-level attacks were least effective, suggesting models are resilient to\nbroader contextual changes.

WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of\nLLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language\nhypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined\nthrough a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the\nproposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected\nusing a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the\nenvironment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based\npredictive model using the current hypotheses.

This limitation primarily stems from two\nfactors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which\nhinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and\n(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason\nbehind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability\nsamples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability\ndetection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the\nscarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data\nsynthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization.

In\nthis paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic\nframework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks\ntrained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in\nthis regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus\nwhere neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons\nrapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step\nprocess: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a\ncost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each\nround, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and\na drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these\ndrops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and\nextends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks\nand attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular\nmodes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we\nprove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.\nApplying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give\nthe first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that\nnetworks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.\nAltogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning\nin neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4ea4\u66ff\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff08AGF\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e24\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5c0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AGF\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u884c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u4f11\u7720\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d3b\u8dc3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "AGF\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e8c\u6b21\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u6309\u7cfb\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u964d\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "AGF\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc8\u51fa\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance.

While foundational\nframeworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal\ndocuments at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,\ncomponent-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic\npoint-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for\nreliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,\ntemporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It\nintroduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and\nLanguage Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its\nlinguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same\nparadigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal\nVersion (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of\nindividual articles, paragraphs, and clauses.

While notable progress has been made in\ntranslating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved\naway from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing\nefforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,\nincrease parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries.

However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV\nsystems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained\nenvironments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of\nmultiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial\nnetworks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we\nconsider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,\nand change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.\nDifferent from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and\ncollaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an\nLLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard\neach UAV handles motion planning and control.

Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined\nNetworking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection\nattacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an\nSDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an\nattack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.\nThen, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection\nmodel, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an\neffective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness.

While classroom dialogue is widely recognised\nas a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the\nneed for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive\nnature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language\nmodels offer promising avenues for automating this process.

Recently, foundation\nmodels have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks\nby capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us\nto ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables\ngeneralizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new\nheterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant\ndifferences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly\nshare common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.\nTherefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining\nshared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise\nheterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation\nsurrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared\nrelation-aware attack units.

In ReLIFT, the model is primarily\ntrained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality\nsolutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates\nbetween RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT\nachieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five\ncompetition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to\nother zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both\nRL and SFT while using only 13\\% of the detailed demonstration data,\nhighlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that\nReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the\nsignificant potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dRL\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408RL\u548cSFT\u7684ReLIFT\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790RL\u548cSFT\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReLIFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u96be\u9898\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "ReLIFT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8d855.2\u5206\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6RL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8be6\u7ec6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8d85\u8fc7RL\u548cSFT\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLIFT\u514b\u670d\u4e86RL\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods typically train\nagents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static\ndifficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments\nand often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum\nlearning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL\nthat employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism\ncontinuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training\nperformance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more\nchallenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability\ndue to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),\nwhich is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit\nsignals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA\nconstructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual\ncontributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates\nthroughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through\nconstructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic\nrewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under\nnon-stationary conditions.

This disparity between prior and updated\nenvironmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous\ndecision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain\nstakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time\nobservation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and\ncontext-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains\nan open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding\nand Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a\ndomain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making\narchitecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)\ninto a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex\ntasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each\nfocused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike\ntraditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER\nintegrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring\nverbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence\ndecision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived\ninsights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration\nfacilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\nWe benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\nexploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,\ngoal-conditioned policies.

Most existing methods assume that all\nqueries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than\nirrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal\nsimilarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods\nhave shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on\nthe construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video\nrepresentations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard\nnegative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic\nsimilarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive\nlearning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust\ndiscriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module\n(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further\nintroducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively\nidentify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the\ntraining loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model\nfine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby\npresent a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to\nconstruct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating\nfine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL\ndesigns an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to\nmodel subtle semantic differences.

Recently, activation steering has emerged as an\neffective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction\nvector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further\ninduce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying\nactivation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and\nutility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and\ndegraded performance on benign prompts.

(ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised\nExpert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on\ntest data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test\ndistributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance\nregression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.\nTo reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test\ndistributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a\nnormal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution\nthat emphasizes rare target regions.

In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines\ncMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to\npersonalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral\nself-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each\ndelivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical\nactivity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using\ndynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,\nsocial influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants\nreceive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,\ncombined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization\n(RCT).

However, because\ntactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that\nrequire broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A\nhuman-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception\ntechniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more\ninformative or significant features and integrate such information over time in\norder to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and\ndifferent methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention\nrecently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an\nopen-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active\ntactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume\nestimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from\nsimple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using\nvision-based tactile sensors.

This paper develops a\ntheoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model\nstaleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL\nconvergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic\nsparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based\non contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing\nthat under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to\nenhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the\nsparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact\ntime. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.

Features from both channels\nare subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to\nproduce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the\nlimitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features.

This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage\nstructural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where\ninter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the\npotential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text\nsegments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through\nstructural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively\nattend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than\nall preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a\ngraph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a\nmessage-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated\npositional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and\ncontext window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)\nseven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and\nlong-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with\nfull-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper\ntopic classification within a citation network.

Moreover, existing prompt optimization\nmethods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive\nabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior\nOptimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting\ntechnique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,\nwhich focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In\nparticular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the\noptimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a\ngradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging\ntasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.\nExperimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent\nprompt optimization methods on most tasks.

To address this, we propose\nSelf-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an\nattacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction.

Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing\nenergy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of\nconverting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of\nenergy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face\ndifficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.\nPrevious research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the\nenergy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of\nP2G.\n  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be\napplied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and\ngas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex\ncase studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep\nQ-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to\nenhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,\nimplementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost\ncalculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our\nfindings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex\ndecision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose\nsignificantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation\nstrategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G\ntechnologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5c06DRL\u7528\u4e8eP2G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0eBES\u3001\u71c3\u6c14\u8f6e\u673a\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u6539\u8fdbDRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5236\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "P2G\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fd0\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u590d\u6742\uff0cDRL\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eP2G\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5956\u52b1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u77ed\u671f\u5ffd\u7565\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30DRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5305\u62ec\u6574\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u6218\u7565\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "DRL\u521d\u59cb\u5e94\u5bf9P2G\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5236\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u89e3\u9501P2G\u6280\u672f\u957f\u671f\u50a8\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution\ngate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive\nupdating of transformer architecture is realized.

We also use this same approach\nand find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge\ninstitutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when\ncontrolling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows\nus to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the\nshock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs\noffer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional\nmeasurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for\nwhen researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u53d7\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8b\u4ef6\u524d\u611f\u77e5\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u653f\u6cbb\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4ee5DOGE\u88c1\u5458\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793aLLMs\u53ef\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51b2\u51fb\u80cc\u540e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u53d7\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u91cd\u6784\u4e8b\u4ef6\u524d\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u653f\u6cbb\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5DOGE\u88c1\u5458\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u793a\u4e0eLLMs\u5f97\u51fa\u8054\u90a6\u884c\u653f\u673a\u6784\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6570\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u88c1\u5458\u524d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u54ea\u4e9b\u673a\u6784\u88abDOGE\u9488\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u67d0\u4e9b\u8054\u90a6\u673a\u6784\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u673a\u6784\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u540e\u4ecd\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528LLMs\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e13\u5bb6\u653f\u6cbb\u8c03\u67e5\u3002"}}

With the rapid\nadvancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a\nlow-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.\nAn air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this\nstudy based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality\nforecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates\nmeteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data\nunder the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive\nprediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model\nsuccessfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an\nhourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In\nterms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms\nthe mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.\nAblation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although\nmeteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories\ndo, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting\nprecision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing\npollution mechanisms across megacities.

To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time\nactive learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via\nepisodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes.

Take the phrase \"ribonucleic\nacid\" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,\nartificial text fragments (\"rib\", \"on\", ...), then learn each token\nsequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic\nentity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding\nand, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we\nintroduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method\nthat redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences\nthat span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional\nnext-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional\napplications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo\nprotein design.

In this study, we go beyond performance\ncomparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in\nrecurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and\nwhat mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks\n(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a\nflexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.\nAcross a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus\nselection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but\noften optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more\ninterpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results\nprovide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,\nbridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range\nmemory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with\nimplications for both artificial and biological neural systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5256\u6790\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u5c0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8db3\u591f\u4e14\u5e38\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5f80\u8ba4\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u5f52\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5256\u6790\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08AL - RNNs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ecf\u5178\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u523a\u6fc0\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6781\u5c0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u5168\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u90fd\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS\noutperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,\nyielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.\nMoreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based\nTSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9 - \u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684ViT4TS\u8fdb\u884c\u5019\u9009\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684VLM4TS\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u5f02\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "VLM4TS\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cF1 - max\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534724.6%\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u9ad836\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We also conduct an investigation\ninto the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,\nsecond-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the\nresulting learning dynamics.

These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed\n`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for\na given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional\nhyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains\nuncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model\nsets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to\ndiscover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.\nHowever, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally\nexpensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early\ncomparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of\npost-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning\nframework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an\norder of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full\ntraining. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn\nTreebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under\nfixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies\nsuperior pruned models.

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment\nmapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional\nmodality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal\nspatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained\nmultimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these\nmaps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our\nmaps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to\naudio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When\ncombined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural\nlanguage commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., \"in between the\nsofa and TV\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across\ndifferent robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.\nBuilding upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a\nunified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues\nthrough the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.\nThis enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or\naudio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the\nincorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal\ndisambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and\nreal-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps\nenable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by\n50% in ambiguous scenarios.

This study aimed to develop and benchmark\nmachine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in\ncommunity-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A\nnew set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was\nintroduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine\nlearning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem\nformulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular\nsensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly\ndetection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the\nTechnology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly\navailable dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,\ncomprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most\neffective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the\ncurrent 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.\nIncorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation\nhistory, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720\nand AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work\npresents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques\nfor agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using\nprivacy-preserving sensor data.

Recent\nadvancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the\npotential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals\ninherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its\nrationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share\ncommonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative\npairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples\nprovides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,\nthese methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the\ninsufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,\nwe propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the\nPatient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to\nmitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter\npatient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained\nmodel, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more\nperspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data\nratios.

In review", "summary": "Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its\nsignificant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched\nfilter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect\nmethane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned\nanthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an\nincreasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume\ndetection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this\nwork, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that\nleverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,\nreconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task\nacross platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data\nfrom the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on\nairborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,\noutperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an\nunsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data\ndistributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne\nEMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne\nclassifiers directly yields the best plume detection results.

Traditional approaches\nto G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning\nfrom planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand\nsignificant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use\ncommon sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP\nproblems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),\nwhich have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide\ntask planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric\nreasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric\ninformation derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to\ngenerate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of\ncontinuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing\nto LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action\nspace and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that\ncalls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to\nwarm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.\nOn six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM\nplanners and pure search algorithms.

The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of\n``retuning of cellular signal selectivity\" in the brain attention systems,\nwhich enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\non the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in\nprecision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014\nand DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness.

Significant attention has focused on using reward\nmodels as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models\nthemselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning\nprompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We\npresent a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive\nanalysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining\nhow different reward models score every possible single-token response to\nvalue-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial\nheterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic\nasymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant\nsensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)\novervaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten\nrecent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.\nOur results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward\nmodels, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and\ncontext-dependent human values.

Due to the NP-hard nature, many\nheuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP.

This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic\nalgorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse\ngraphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency\nof HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to\nimprove the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to\nreduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic\nfor efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three\nstate-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three\nlarge-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,\ntotaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently\noutperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency for the majority of instances.

Traditional static or centralized defense\nmechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework\nfor proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,\nwe design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader\nswitching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent\nflexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network\nresilience.

Each UAV\nis equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions\nbased on partial observations and local experiences.

These knowledge\ndatabases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.\nHowever, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access\nto such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,\nparticularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods\ntargeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the\nvisual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG\nsystems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by\ncounterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to\nretrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership\ninformation. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method\nto constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.\nBuilding on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to\nprioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the\ninterference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we\nperform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract\nfeatures that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response\npatterns.

To address this gap, this study conducts a\ncomparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,\nGPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify\npotential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested\nunder three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\n(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated\nbasic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided\nstep-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative\nanalysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all\nconditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced\nperformance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across\nmodels. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with\nGPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings.

Additionally, we introduce a\nplanning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain\nDefinition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by\nleveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities.

In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement\nalgorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO\nto Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this\npaper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that\nimpede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the\nvanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose\nDeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO\n(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO\nreformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the\nadvantage in GRPO.

To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an\nLM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of\nparallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the\ncombined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,\nand dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for\nhigh-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a\nmodular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different\ntoken types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we\nintroduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a\nsemi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training.

However, existing DP image synthesis methods\nstruggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the\nstructure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,\nreferred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can\ngenerate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes\neach private image into a concise textual description using image to text\nmodels, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP\ntext, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a\nmulti-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the\nintroduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),\nwhich explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that\ncorresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic\nEdge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic\ninformation at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel\nModule (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers\nusing an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel\nconvolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally\nefficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision\n(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline\nmodels such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms\nthat our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely\nfocused on object boundaries.

Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed\nthat attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One\ncountermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged\nduring charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,\nallowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected\nand repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective\nauthentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling\nraises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns\ncould enable user tracking.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using\nphysical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that\nvoltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to\ncurrent behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage\nmeasurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling. Our approach\nimproves existing methods by enabling faster and more reliable vehicle\nidentification.

For code, see\n  https://github.com/opendrivelab/ETA", "summary": "How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a\ncommon dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system\narchitecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a\nlarger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system\ndesigns often implement parallel architectures where inference is either\ndirectly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved\nfrom previously stored inference results.

However, editing such models\nefficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous\ninformation - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model\nediting either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to\nscale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework\nthat injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter\nmodule, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By\nsparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines\neach edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing\ninterference among edits.

The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve\nthese goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development\nand conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting\nlung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT\n2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45\ndisease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a\nnew focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the\nprevious event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed\nclassification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a\nmanually annotated \"gold standard\" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization\nto five previously unseen disease findings.

We achieve this efficiency through\nsystematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training\ndata, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable\nsatisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training\ntokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse\non-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B\nparameters, respectively.

By redesigning the noise\ninitialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable\nhigh-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary\nmodules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic\ninversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and\nresolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order\nRecursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this\nrepresentation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the\nVAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions\nresulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which\nperforms visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded\nregions.

While the existing solution for removing these\noutliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned\nregister tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to\nmitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our\ndiscovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic\nthe effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We\ndemonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,\nenhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,\nand achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register\ntokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language\nmodels to improve their interpretability.
