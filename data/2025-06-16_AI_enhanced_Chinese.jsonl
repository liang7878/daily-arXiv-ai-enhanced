Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown\npromise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated\nand scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is\ndifficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and\nproposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the\nautomated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective\nphysicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is\nfine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient\nconversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including\nProfessionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual\nDistraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from\nthe LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on\nmultidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The\nresults show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\\% accuracy, with\nmajor criteria items over 90\\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a\nsolution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment.

While Pointwise ranking\napproaches offer computational efficiency by scoring documents independently,\nthey often yield biased relevance estimates due to the lack of inter-document\ncomparisons. In contrast, Pairwise methods improve ranking accuracy by\nexplicitly comparing document pairs, but suffer from substantial computational\noverhead with quadratic complexity ($O(n^2)$). To address this tradeoff, we\npropose \\textbf{RefRank}, a simple and effective comparative ranking method\nbased on a fixed reference document. Instead of comparing all document pairs,\nRefRank prompts the LLM to evaluate each candidate relative to a shared\nreference anchor. By selecting the reference anchor that encapsulates the core\nquery intent, RefRank implicitly captures relevance cues, enabling indirect\ncomparison between documents via this common anchor.

Unlike traditional software defects,\nconnector vulnerabilities exhibit subtle behavioral patterns and are inherently\nchallenging to detect. Besides, nonstandardized implementation of connectors\nleaves potential risks (a.k.a. unsafe implementations) but is more elusive. As\na result, traditional fuzzing methods are incapable of finding such\nvulnerabilities. Even for LLM-enable test case generation, due to a lack of\ndomain knowledge, they are also incapable of generating test cases that invoke\nall interface and internal logic of connectors. In this paper, we propose\nreinforcement learning (RL)-guided LLM test-case generation for database\nconnector testing. Specifically, to equip the LLM with sufficient and\nappropriate domain knowledge, a parameterized prompt template is composed which\ncan be utilized to generate numerous prompts. Test cases are generated via LLM\nwith a prompt, and are dynamically evaluated through differential testing\nacross multiple connectors.

In this paper, we focus on the memory\nrestrictions that arise in real-world deployments. We introduce the\n$\\mu$-CONGEST model where on top of the bandwidth restriction, the memory of\nnodes is also limited to $\\mu$ words, in line with real-world systems. We\nprovide fast algorithms of two main flavors.\n  First, we observe that many algorithms in the CONGEST model are\nmemory-intensive and do not work in $\\mu$-CONGEST. A prime example of a family\nof algorithms that use large memory is clique-listing algorithms. We show that\nthe memory issue that arises here cannot be resolved without incurring a cost\nin the round complexity, by establishing a lower bound on the round complexity\nof listing cliques in $\\mu$-CONGEST. We introduce novel techniques to overcome\nthese issues and generalize the algorithms to work within a given memory bound.\nCombined with our lower bound, these provide tight tradeoffs between the\nrunning time and memory of nodes.\n  Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently simulate various families\nof streaming algorithms in $\\mu$-CONGEST. These include fast simulations of\n$p$-pass algorithms, random order streams, and various types of mergeable\nstreaming algorithms.\n  Combining our contributions, we show that we can use streaming algorithms to\nefficiently generate statistics regarding combinatorial structures in the\nnetwork.

However, existing methods often rely on globally\naggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are\nprimarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing\nto attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and\nundermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel\nend-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local\nneighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.\nSpecifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents\nInteractor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss).

A considerable portion of the\nglobal energy supply is consumed in the building sector and plays a pivotal\nrole in future decarbonization pathways.

To assess\nPPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising\n706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on\nPPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder\ncomplex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently\nsurpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and\n16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bPPDiff\uff0c\u53ef\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5730\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u6309\u9700\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6e7f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSSINC\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efaPPDiff\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4ea4\u9519\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u3001kNN\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u5c42\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff1b\u521b\u5efaPPBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "PPDiff\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a50.00%\u300123.16%\u548c16.89%\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PPDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However,\nverification of these models remains a significant challenge due to the\npotentially large datasets used by the digital twin. This paper introduces an\ninnovative methodology for verifying neural network-based digital twin models,\nin a black-box fashion, by integrating model checking into the process. The\nlatter relies on defining and applying system-level contracts that capture the\nsystem's requirements, to verify the behavior of digital twin models,\nimplemented in Simulink. We develop an automated solution that simulates the\ndigital twin model for certain inputs, and feeds the predicted outputs together\nwith the inputs to the contract model described as a network of timed automata\nin the UPPAAL model checker. The latter verifies whether the predicted outputs\nfulfill the specified contracts.

To address this issue, prior research has explored\nvirtualization techniques for monolithic NPUs, but has neglected inter-core\nconnected NPUs with the hardware topology.\n  This paper introduces vNPU, the first comprehensive virtualization design for\ninter-core connected NPUs, integrating three novel techniques: (1) NPU route\nvirtualization, which redirects instruction and data flow from virtual NPU\ncores to physical ones, creating a virtual topology; (2) NPU memory\nvirtualization, designed to minimize translation stalls for SRAM-centric and\nNoC-equipped NPU cores, thereby maximizing the memory bandwidth; and (3)\nBest-effort topology mapping, which determines the optimal mapping from all\ncandidate virtual topologies, balancing resource utilization with end-to-end\nperformance. We have developed a prototype of vNPU on both an FPGA platform\n(Chipyard+FireSim) and a simulator (DCRA).

In contrast,\nTversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a\nrepresentation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a\nfunction of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers.

This approach is capable of non-linearly partitioning\nsurvival data which includes continuous, right-censored outcomes. Our method\nimproves on an existing non-parametric method, which uses at most oblique\nsplits to induce survival regression trees. In the prior work, these oblique\nsplits were created via a non-SVM approach, by minimizing a piece-wise linear\nobjective, called a dipole splitting criterion, constructed from pairs of\ncovariates and their associated survival information. We extend this method by\nenabling splits from a general class of non-linear surfaces. We achieve this by\nridge regularizing the dipole-splitting criterion to enable application of\nkernel methods in a manner analogous to classical SVMs. The ridge\nregularization provides robustness and can be tuned. Using various kernels, we\ninduce both linear and non-linear survival trees to compare their sizes and\npredictive powers on real and simulated data sets.

A precise LTV prediction\nsystem enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed\nadvertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.\nNonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically\nobserved in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among\nregistered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset\nwhere the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is\ninsufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction\nmodel. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks\nwith high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's\ncontribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths\nof these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly\ncorrelated.

Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy\ndetermines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the\nlarge model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides\nwhether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human\nintervention.

It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,\nwhich, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph\nto the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured\nby the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a\nconstrained optimization process of the RSA.

Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the\nintermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making\nunder resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is\nessential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We\npropose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,\nrule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic\nfeedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core\ndimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To\noperationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including\novercorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and\nover-budget ratio.

By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6\npercent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive\nresource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection\nrisk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),\nsuggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes.

However, their structure\nconstrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing\nmulti-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a\npre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of\nmulti-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source\nTransition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that\nact on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy\nto parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential\nlinear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this\nscheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,\nand padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding\nactivation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:\na directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode\n(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce\narrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains\nlong-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize\nwell to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On\nestablished molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show\nstrong performance.

However, the increasingly marginal performance gains\nsuggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the\ndevelopment of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future\nresearch, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs\nquantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively\nalleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie\nwithin the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a\nplug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines\nnamed Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space\nprojection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.\nSubsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent\nvector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference\ncondition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and\nbaselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective\nof null space optimization for LLMs quantization.

Vuran"], "title": "I Can't Believe It's Not Real: CV-MuSeNet: Complex-Valued Multi-Signal Segmentation", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges\nfor efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic\nspectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness\nof complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training\nefficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

In this paper, to achieve this goal, we propose the application\nof the Adaptive Clustering Method (ACM) of Information Systems developed by the\nauthor, which is based on the idea of a seamless system architecture that\nprovides explicit interconnection of project artifacts of different levels of\nabstraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ACM\uff09\u5c06\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7f1d\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ACM\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks fall\nshort -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on\nless capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major\nadvancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes\nboth original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from\nten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and\nnon-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate\nten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four\nrealistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three\ncomplementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the\nstrengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges\nfor future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed\nto advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code\ndetectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faCodeMirage\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u52a9\u529bAI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u652f\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCodeMirage\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5341\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u6539\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u5341\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u7528\u5176\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5341\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeMirage\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u901a\u7528\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u5b9e\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

This practical challenge\nsignificantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,\nwe propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing\nPKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,\nCoda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a\ncompact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be\nidentified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a\ncluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak\nsignals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

Yet, the\ninherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated\nsequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant\nchallenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.\nAlthough recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to\nensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose\na novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel\ncode translation to address the functional equivalence issue.

Through an iterative loop consisting of\nCo-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate\ndata for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests\nto verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving\nthe Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented\ninput to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to\nQwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester\nperformance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while\nachieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Submitted for publication. for\n  associated blog post, see https://pradyut3501.github.io/lora-spur-corr/", "summary": "Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\naligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks\nin a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of\nprogress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible\ncatastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to\nsearch for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small\namount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream\ntask classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token\nfor decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from\nincorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to\ncontrol a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In\nSSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected\nby the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be\ncontrolled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models\nfrom three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and\nfour diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias\nin Bios).

However, through amounts of carefully designed\nexperiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of\nwidely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one\nmodality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a\nself-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,\nwidening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and\ndeactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,\nwe propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which\nbalances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the\nself-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap.

Further analysis reveals that multilingual\nattention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting\ntheir critical role in multilingual scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCLAIM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLAIM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u79fb\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "CLAIM\u5728POPE\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534713.56%\uff08\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u6700\u9ad830%\uff09\uff0c\u5728MME\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b50\u96c6\u63d0\u534721.75%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6700\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API\nusage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem.

For example, in LMDB, a\npopular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by\nthe library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be\nleveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%\nwith the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the\nAPIs are used in the field.\n  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be\nused to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce\nvarious metrics useful to library developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf921\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u6e90C\u5e93\u7684API\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefAPI\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5e93\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u5bf9API\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u884cAPI\u5e38\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LibProbe\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u5176API\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf921\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u6e90C\u5e93\u53ca3061\u4e2aC/C++\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1LibProbe\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u672a\u6839\u636e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u914d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u529b\uff0c\u6d41\u884cAPI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u5e93\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5982\u4f7fLMDB\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63d0\u9ad814.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAPI\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0cLibProbe\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5e93\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u6790\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002"}}

Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the\nwidely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative\nsettings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the\nfidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation\nremain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a\npractical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose\na unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in\nrelation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible\napplication.

However, in the context of limited and noisy data,\naccurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is\na challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.\nCurrent methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for\nreal-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the\nDelayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,\nby developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)\ntransformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state\n(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From\ndynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than\nindividual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such\nnonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a\nsingle shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical\nstates from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs\ndistinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently\npredicting all original variables parallelly.

In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based\nEdge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.\nKCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the\ngraph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error\nbound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the\nchange in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically\nintroduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful\neffects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly\nintegrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without\nrequiring training.

Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data\nsubset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance.

Recent\nstudies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma\n7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of\nall tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated\nfine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning\n(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the\nprinciples of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of\nManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with\nnumerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of\nsolely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the\ncontext as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of\nmany-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning.

Inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,\nparticularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current\nreal-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset\nneeds to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical\nmotion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing\nerrors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen\nmovements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming\nand impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a\nself-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint\nkinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth\nlabels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the\nhuman body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement\ndata. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the\nmeasured sensor data instead of a ground truth.

We also find that standard graph structure attack methods\ncan significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the\ncandidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.\nBeyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques\ntailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial\ntraining, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of\nGraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,\nequitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u542f\u53d1\uff0cGraphLLMs\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5f15\u5165TrustGLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "GraphLLMs\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u65bd\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30GraphLLMs\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5404\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "GraphLLMs\u6613\u53d7\u6587\u672c\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u6253\u4e71\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aGraphLLMs\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological\nfeatures, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability\nof data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of\nsubsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that\nmimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic\nintrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of\nsamples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic\ndata is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen\nmap of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with\nincreasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,\nfaults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the\ncombination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network\nmodel using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be\nfine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a\ngiven region.

We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based\nMemory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables\nmodel fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC\nconstructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.\nFine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle\nthe misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we\npropose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,\nwhich thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports\nflexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it\nadaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.\nMoreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a\nsingle 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to\nindividual users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdEMLoC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8865\u507f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ea0\u6b63LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u5f2024GB\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c0338B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "EMLoC\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4eba\u7528\u6237\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u3002"}}

The newly proposed\nmetric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to\ntheir signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the\nmetric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.\nNumerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eKuiper\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6309\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u65f6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u5f88\u5c11\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u7f8e\u591a\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u8861\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Kuiper\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6309\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u52a0\u6743\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7701\u7565\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u65f6\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d8\u5f97\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7bb1\u6216\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the\npromise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both\nspatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models\neither ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene\nregulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from\nneighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with\nhierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create\ncontextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics\ndata, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation\nmodel for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as\nspatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a\ngene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph\ntransformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing\nwithin levels.

To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated\nresponses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in\nthe images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by\nhallucinations).

Results reveal that pretrained BERT\nenables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.\nHowever, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding\nspace only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks.

Simulation- and\nscenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and\nvalidation of autonomous driving systems.

With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new\ngeneration of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process\nheterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control\nactions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving\nscenarios.

In this work, we introduce Vehicle\nVision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized\nfor AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit\nsuperior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial\ntraining, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs\nunder adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,\nwhere individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where\na single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.\nExperimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%\nunder attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of\nless than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient\nalternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore\nintegrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience\nagainst adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising\npath toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u611f\u77e5\u7684V2LMs\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aV2LMs\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDNNs\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165V2LMs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Solo Mode\u548cTandem Mode\u4e24\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06V2LMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "DNNs\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d33% - 46%\uff0cV2LMs\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e8%\uff0cTandem Mode\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0eSolo Mode\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "V2LMs\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for\nlarge ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel\nfully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison\n-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit\ntriples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol\nachieves an online speedup of 17$\\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further\nenhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\npreprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption\noperations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\\times$ on GPU\nfor linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that\nensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the\nresults of plaintext computations.

We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,\nwhich has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and\nItalian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.\nThrough several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling\nachieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language\nModels (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source\nmodels, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/NLP-FBK/e3c-to-crf-67b9844065460cbe42f80166", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3CRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CRF\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728CRF\u586b\u5145\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u826f\u597d\u7684CRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u586b\u5145CRF\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CRF\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eE3C\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u82f1\u3001\u610f\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c01\u95ed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0b\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u69fd\u586b\u5145\u8fbe59.7%\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u8fbe67.3%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u586b\u5145CRFs\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002"}}

Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich\nanalyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical\nlongform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant\nchallenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no\nexisting study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data.

In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect\nthose utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern\nASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a\nnotable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the\napproach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a\nmedian word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%\nof the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech\nwithout any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%.

Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction.
