Due to the focusing our\njudging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of\nthis year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish\nbetween runs and reuse the dataset in future.

In addition to buyers paying store-specific\npurchase prices and couriers receiving store--buyer-specific delivery\ncompensation from the platform, each buyer has the option to directly tip for\ndelivery from a specific store. An equilibrium consists of prices,\ncompensations, tips, and transactions that clear the market, such that buyers\nreceive deliveries from preferred stores considering the prices and tips they\npay, and couriers deliver preferred orders considering the compensations and\ntips they receive.\n  We illustrate the role of tips in pricing: Without tips, an equilibrium is\nonly guaranteed to exist when there are at least as many couriers as buyers or\nstores. In contrast, with tips an equilibrium always exists. From an efficiency\nperspective, the optimal with-tip equilibrium welfare is always weakly larger\nthan the optimal without-tip equilibrium welfare. However, we show that even\nwith tips, efficient equilibria may not exist, and calculating the optimal\nequilibrium welfare is NP-hard.

However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7ea7\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5206\u914d\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u7c07\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u56e2\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7ea7\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations are crucial tools for studying atomic-level dynamics. This work\nfocuses on improving the efficiency of MD simulations involving two-body and\nthree-body interactions. Traditional two-body potentials often can not fully\ncapture the complexity of molecular systems, making the inclusion of three-body\ninteractions important. However, these interactions are in a cubic complexity\nclass, compared to a quadratic one for two-body interactions, and therefore are\ncomputationally expensive, even when a cutoff distance is applied. One way to\nimprove efficiency is to use the r-RESPA multiple time-stepping algorithm to\nreduce the number of three-body interaction calculations.

We first\ncompute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between\nadjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path\ndistances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices\nwhich we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the\nproperties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate\ndenoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high\nprobability.

Using a simplified model\nof taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where\nwe maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted\nconsumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and\nreliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy\nthat determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at\nthat time.

These reviews also provide\ndevelopers with valuable insights into improving apps by addressing issues and\nintroducing better features. However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of\nreviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related\nconcerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software\nutilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,\nprivacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine\nlearning.

This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE\ndemonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC:\n0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance.

A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted by ICML2025 as a poster", "summary": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph.

This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem.

In our opinion, this is the\nreason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To\naddress this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code\ncomprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more\nrobust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of\nvarying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess\nsemantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In\nparticular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe\nthat model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.\nThe most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy\nincreases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across\nother models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.\nAmong the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest\nmicro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0cDPO\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Codestral - 22B\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fae\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u9762\u53e5\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982QWQ - 32B\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece70%\u63d0\u5347\u523083.47%\uff0cDPO\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Codestral - 22B\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fae\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional cybersecurity\nmethods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and\nintelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and\nsoftware tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling\nadversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in\nautonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity.

First,\nthe Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in\nthe estimates.

This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known\nneighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to\niteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering\ninformation to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware\nFeature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting\npropagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,\nHierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing\nnodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood\nattributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups\nwith nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster\nstructure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.\nFinally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information\nacross multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node\nrepresentations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show\nthat DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC\nmethods under attribute-missing graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDivide - Then - Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC)\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u56fe\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u56fe\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8282\u70b9\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTRGC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542bDynamic Cluster - Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP)\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7f3a\u5931\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0cHierarchical Neighborhood - aware Imputation (HNAI)\u5206\u5c42\u63d2\u8865\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0cHop - wise Representation Enhancement (HRE)\u6574\u5408\u591a\u8df3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDTRGC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u56fe\u4e0b\u5404\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DTRGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u56fe\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, we observe that current\nJIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets\nare artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing\nand vulnerability-fixing commits.\n  To address this limitation, this study assesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP\ntechniques under a more realistic setting that includes both\nvulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To enable a reliable\nevaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset comprising over one\nmillion commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our empirical analysis of\neight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a significant decline in\npredictive performance when applied to real-world conditions; for example, the\naverage PR-AUC on Linux drops 98\\% from 0.805 to 0.016. This discrepancy is\nmainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in real-world datasets, where\nvulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a small fraction of all\ncommits.\n  To mitigate this issue, we explore the effectiveness of widely adopted\ntechniques for handling dataset imbalance, including customized loss functions,\noversampling, and undersampling. Surprisingly, our experimental results\nindicate that these techniques are ineffective in addressing the imbalance\nproblem in JIT-VP. These findings underscore the importance of realistic\nevaluations of JIT-VP and the need for domain-specific techniques to address\ndata imbalance in such scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5373\u65f6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9884\u6d4b\uff08JIT - VP\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dJIT - VP\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5305\u542b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u63d0\u4ea4\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u767e\u4e07\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbJIT - VP\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5e38\u7528\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6JIT - VP\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9JIT - VP\u8fdb\u884c\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks).

AOD greatly affects the operational\nand economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through\nphotovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.\n  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling\narchitecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series\nand meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other\nmeteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses.\nThe framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\nwas used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study\nproposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based\non predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to\nadjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance\nscheduling, and regulate energy source switching.\n  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive\nmodels and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for\nscenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support\nsystem for climate-adaptive planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u963f\u8054\u914b\u6d77\u6c34\u6de1\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u9762\u4e34\u6c14\u5019\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9884\u6d4bAOD\u548c\u6de1\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98%\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAOD\u548c\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u6253\u5305\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u8054\u914b\u6d77\u6c34\u6de1\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u591a\uff0c\u4e14\u9762\u4e34\u6c14\u5019\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982AOD\u5f71\u54cd\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u6d77\u6c34\u6de1\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u536b\u661f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4bAOD\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AOD\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6c14\u8c61\u56e0\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u6de1\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9000\u5316\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAOD\u548c\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98%\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u6d77\u6c34\u6de1\u5316\u5382\u8fdb\u6c34\u538b\u529b\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u7ef4\u62a4\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u6e90\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6253\u5305\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement\nsymmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of\nradical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a\ngroup theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining\ncharacteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,\nwhen a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our\nanalysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and\nwe introduce quantitative measures to characterize these.

As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths.

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature.

However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions.

Elk structures these performance factors into\nconfigurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.\nTo systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk\nemploys a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip\nmemory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans\nthat best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the\nefficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip\nIPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different\ninterconnect network topologies.

To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision.

Here, we propose a vision-language\nmodel-based commander to address the issue of intelligent\nperception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method\nintegrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight\nlarge language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and\ndecision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and\ninterpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,\nthe combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting\nthe cognitive process of human commanders.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines.

Our approach combines on chain smart\ncontracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision\nmaking, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the\nflexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents\n(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a\ncoordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled\npilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token\nissuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The\nMarket Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5\npercent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:\nan oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a\nsimulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user\nimpact.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results.

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality.

Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the\nproposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to\ndirect generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention\nElicitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdOpus Prompt Intention Framework\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0Opus\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u610f\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5c42\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u57281000\u4e2a\u591a\u610f\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2 - \u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5bf9\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u5f15\u51fa\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction.

The journal version will be updated soon", "summary": "Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products\n(subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a\nclassic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various\nindustries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial\nand non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment\noptimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a\ngraph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the\npatterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies\nbased on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances.

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles.

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning\nattacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for\nDMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for\nvisualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we\nobserve that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept\nregions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism\ncomprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency\npoison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid\nadversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain\nlearning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning\nmethods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all\npoisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published\ndefenses.

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity.

However, this dependence exposes them to\nsophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to\ndeceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly\nperturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without\ntriggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional\ndistributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a\nthreshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and\ntimely response.

Tractometry is an\nadvanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to\ninvestigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber\ntracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract\ndifferences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this\nstudy, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely\nAGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation\ntesting to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.\nThere are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN).

This\nparadigm, however, misconstrues the true nature of money laundering, which is\nrarely anomalous but often deliberate, repeated, and concealed within\nconsistent behavioral routines. In this paper, we challenge the entity-centric\napproach and propose a network-theoretic perspective that emphasizes detecting\npredefined laundering patterns across directed transaction networks. We\nintroduce the notion of behavioral consistency as the core trait of laundering\nactivity, and argue that such patterns are better captured through subgraph\nstructures expressing semantic and functional roles - not solely geometry.\nCrucially, we explore the concept of pattern fragility: the sensitivity of\nlaundering patterns to small attribute changes and, conversely, their semantic\nrobustness even under drastic topological transformations. We claim that\nlaundering detection should not hinge on statistical outliers, but on\npreservation of behavioral essence, and propose a reconceptualization of\npattern similarity grounded in this insight.

The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its\nenvironment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while\nmaintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08NMF\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u66f4\u65b0\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u8c31\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u80cc\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u5927\uff0c\u6613\u8d85\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u6216\u727a\u7272\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfNMF\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eNMF\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u80cc\u666f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94NMF\u7b97\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNMF\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94NMF\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u6838\u4e0d\u6269\u6563\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing.

A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities.

We conducted an experimental\nstudy of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding\naccuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source\nMAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and\nconsensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion\nparameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding\ndecisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from\nonline math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona.

In particular, unconscious parental\nexpectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional\nexpression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5bb6\u5ead\u5e78\u798f\u4e2d\u6613\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u6c9f\u901a\u652f\u6301\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u53cd\u9988\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e92\u52a8\u79ef\u6781\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5982\u7406\u60f3\u7236\u6bcd\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b69\u5b50\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u53d7\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u5bdf\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u6c9f\u901a\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b30\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65e5\u7248\u4eb2\u5b50\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u652f\u6301\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7531\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5143\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6c47\u603b\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4ee5\u4e2d\u7b49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u68c0\u6d4b\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u663e\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention\nrequires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units\nresult in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.

However, it is challenging for\ncomputers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human\nPerception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based\nRepresentation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between\ncomputational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that\nallows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative\nevaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to\ntraditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our\nknowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for\ncolor attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable\nsample of the human population (n = 2496).

Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm\nfor unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common\ntheoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which\ncovers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods\nneed at most $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to\ncompute an $\\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the\nbound-constrained problem.
