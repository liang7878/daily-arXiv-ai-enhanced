Alternating methods, where players take turns to\nupdate their strategies, have long been recognized as simple and practical\napproaches for learning in games, exhibiting much better numerical performance\nthan their simultaneous counterparts. However, our theoretical understanding of\nalternating algorithms remains limited, and results are mostly restricted to\nthe unconstrained setting. We show that for two-player zero-sum games that\nadmit an interior Nash equilibrium, AltGDA converges at an $O(1/T)$ ergodic\nconvergence rate when employing a small constant stepsize. This is the first\nresult showing that alternation improves over the simultaneous counterpart of\nGDA in the constrained setting.

Personalized CIR aims to enhance document retrieval by leveraging\nuser-specific information, such as preferences, knowledge, or constraints, to\ntailor responses to individual needs. A key resource for this task is the TREC\niKAT 2023 dataset, designed to evaluate personalization in CIR pipelines.\nBuilding on this resource, Mo et al. explored several strategies for\nincorporating Personal Textual Knowledge Bases (PTKB) into LLM-based query\nreformulation. Their findings suggested that personalization from PTKBs could\nbe detrimental and that human annotations were often noisy. However, these\nconclusions were based on single-run experiments using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model,\nraising concerns about output variability and repeatability. In this\nreproducibility study, we rigorously reproduce and extend their work, focusing\non LLM output variability and model generalization. We apply the original\nmethods to the new TREC iKAT 2024 dataset and evaluate a diverse range of\nmodels, including Llama (1B-70B), Qwen-7B, GPT-4o-mini. Our results show that\nhuman-selected PTKBs consistently enhance retrieval performance, while\nLLM-based selection methods do not reliably outperform manual choices. We\nfurther compare variance across datasets and observe higher variability on iKAT\nthan on CAsT, highlighting the challenges of evaluating personalized CIR.\nNotably, recall-oriented metrics exhibit lower variance than precision-oriented\nones, a critical insight for first-stage retrievers. Finally, we underscore the\nneed for multi-run evaluations and variance reporting when assessing LLM-based\nCIR systems.

This is accomplished by combining two techniques:\n(1) identifying homomorphic job shapes that support the jobs communication\nneeds, and (2) reconfiguring the optical circuit switch-enabled topology to\nsupport more diverse job shapes. Preliminary evaluation performed on a\n4096-node torus cluster simulator indicates that RFold can improve absolute\ncluster utilization by 57% and reduce job completion time by up to 11x relative\nto existing methods", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRFold\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u4e89\u7528\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96c6\u7fa4\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u96c6\u7fa4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u597d", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u79df\u6237\u73af\u5f62\u62d3\u6251\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e89\u7528\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u96c6\u7fa4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRFold\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u540c\u6001\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u5149\u7535\u8def\u4ea4\u6362\u62d3\u6251\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f", "result": "\u57284096\u8282\u70b9\u73af\u5f62\u96c6\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cRFold\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edd\u5bf9\u96c6\u7fa4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u9ad857%\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1111\u500d", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u7edc\u4e89\u7528\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96c6\u7fa4\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u76ee\u6807"}}

Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether\nmodels possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,\n2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily\napplied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger\nlanguage models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from\nother models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model\nprediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent\nfailure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as\ngenerators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,\nmodels exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families.

The rationale\nis that by varying the internal parameter of TL1, its behavior asymptotically\napproaches either $\\ell_0$ or $\\ell_1$. Since the rank is equal to the number\nof non-zero singular values and the nuclear norm is defined as their sum,\napplying TL1 to the singular values can approximate either the rank or the\nnuclear norm, depending on its internal parameter.

These rates are comparable to those of the classical RPCA\nmodel based on the nuclear norm and $\\ell_1$ norm.

This enables us\nto derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does\nnot rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.\n  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive\nversion of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate\ndepends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the\nregret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIREG - PRM+\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4e0ePRM+\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6536\u655b\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u6570IREG - PRM+\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u540e\u6094\u5411\u91cf\u8303\u6570\u975e\u51cf\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u4e50\u89c2\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "IREG - PRM+\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86$T^{-1/2}$\u6700\u4f73\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c$T^{-1}$\u5e73\u5747\u8fed\u4ee3\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6e38\u620f\u4e0a\u4e0ePRM+\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "IREG - PRM+\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u540e\u6094\u5339\u914d\u65cf\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

As our main building-block, we\ndemonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion.\nThis correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with\nunique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original\npotential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators with\na WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these\nideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves\nprovably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex\nfunctions.

In contrast to\nprior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the\ngeometry of barriers between local minima.

Taken together, the\nresults demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate\nthe discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs\nwhere they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.\nData and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/hockeyguy123/openevolve-star-discrepancy.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u7684QMC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfQMC\u6784\u9020\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\u4e2dQMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6784\u9020\u4f4e\u661f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u96502D/3D\u70b9\u96c6\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u4e0b\u6e38\u79ef\u5206\u9879\u968f\u673aQMC\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u7684Sobol'\u65b9\u5411\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u9020\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6570\u503c\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u4e8c\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b0\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fdb\u5316Sobol'\u53c2\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfQMC\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u5904\u6062\u590d\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650N\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u5904\u6539\u8fdb\u5b83\u4eec\u3002"}}

Finite element (FE) models offer\nhigh-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally\nexpensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility\nfor rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural\noperator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain\ndisplacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and\ntranslational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning\nproblem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance\nelastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D\nbrain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator\n(FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator\nNetwork (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across\nphysiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest\naccuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale\nfeatures, while F-FNO converged 2$\\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet\noffered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\\times$\ncomputational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge\ncomputing applications.

Specifically, we first use randomized\nrounding to extend the discrete EFX constraints into a continuous space and\nshow that an EFX allocation exists if and only if the optimal value of the\ncontinuously extended objective function is nonpositive. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that this optimization problem can be formulated as an\nunconstrained difference of convex (DC) program, which can be further\nsimplified to the minimization of a piecewise linear concave function over a\npolytope. Leveraging this connection, we show that the proposed DC program has\na nonpositive optimal objective value if and only if a well-defined continuous\nvector map admits a fixed point. Crucially, we prove that the reformulated\nfixed point problem satisfies all the conditions of Brouwer's fixed point\ntheorem, except that self-containedness is violated by an arbitrarily small\npositive constant. To address this, we propose a slightly perturbed continuous\nmap that always admits a fixed point.

Our results offer a new\napproach to establishing the existence of EFX allocations through fixed point\ntheorems. Moreover, the equivalence with DC programming enables a more\nefficient and systematic method for computing such allocations (if one exists)\nusing tools from nonlinear optimization.

Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we\ndemonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both\ngeneration and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs.\nOneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while\nunlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and\nnatural reasoning-like generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdOneFlow\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3FLOPs\u5c11\u4e14\u6709\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a81\u7834\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u5165\u7684Edit Flow\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5c06Flow Matching\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u53d1\u6587\u672c - \u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u57281B\u52308B\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cOneFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3FLOPs\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1150%\u3002", "conclusion": "OneFlow\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e76\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict\nhigh-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The\nproposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide\nrange of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is\ntrained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying\ninitial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that\nidentifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware\nrequirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art\ntime-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit,\nLong-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal\nConvolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for\nspecific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to\nunseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of\ntemperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and\ngeneralisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5e8a\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u70ed\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u9009\u70b9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u673a\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u70ed\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Specifically, this is because 1) they\nprovide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an\noptimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing\nprocess, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph\naggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of\nbackdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight\ncorresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution.

In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during\nearly training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that\nincrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix.

Recent studies reveal that\nthese agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes\nthrough preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image\nperturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong\nwhite-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical\nsettings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint\nexploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful\npreference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce\nCross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible\nmodifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting\nCLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to\nsteer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient\naccess, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic\nblack-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own\nlisting's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model\ninternals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary\nand open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both\nmovie selection and e-commerce tasks.

Aligning these agents via\npreference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a\npromising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch.\nTrajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit\nassignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of\nmulti-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical\nPreference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents\nby leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While\nHPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy\nstability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization\nguided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert\ntrajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates\ncontrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained,\nsub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL\nintroduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from\nsimple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group\nlength, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by\nthe reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on\nthree challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO\nloss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities,\nwhile the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a\nwide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HPL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7DPO\u4fe1\u53f7\u592a\u7c97\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7DPO\u592a\u8fd1\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HPL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7DPO\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5c42\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u89e3\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ec4\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPL\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42DPO\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53cc\u5c42\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

A key structural\nfeature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who\nshare few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or\nhinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to\ndiffering assumptions about individual decision-making.

At the individual level, we find that higher payoff\nuncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However,\npersonal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead\nto substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At\nthe collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long\nties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as\nuncertainty increases.

However, the performance of existing\nanomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large\nvolume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches\nbased on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed.\nNevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between\nsource and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this\npaper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on\nactive domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active\nlearning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to\ntrain a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the\nother hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based\nsampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual\nlabeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with\nminimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different\ncombinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01%\nF1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art\nmethods by 26.28%.

This\nstudy presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of\nDL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to\nuncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during\nthe development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these\nissues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML\nprojects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the\nintroduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories\nto assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that\nDL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages\nof project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD\ndurations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists.\nAdditionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during\nfeature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for\ntargeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to\nmitigate its impact.

In CALM, an expert intervener identifies\nreasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM\nincorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions\nmodify fewer than 2.6\\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for\nsoft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then\nfurther improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop\n\\textbf{STORM} (\\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a\n4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of\n68.9\\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the\nperformance of a 671B LRM.

Time series, as a fundamental modality in\nscientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in\ncurrent multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or\nconvert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive\nscientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time\nseries models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their\neffectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains\nunclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12\nscientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and\nmultivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz\nin frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal\nLLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs\nexhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while\nrepresenting time series as text or images limits their performance due to\nexcessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We\nthen introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to\nunderstand and generate time series while remaining compatible with\ngeneral-purpose LLM training.

Results show GPT-4.1 leads with a macro-F1 of 61.53% for\nNER and 15.02% for event extraction, highlighting the importance of\nwell-crafted prompting to maximize performance in very low-resource scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u53c2\u4e0eEvalLLM 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0cGPT - 4.1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u53c2\u4e0eEvalLLM 2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6cd5\u8bed\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u5c11\u6837\u672c\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408GPT - 4.1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GLiNER\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLaMA - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct\uff1b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u91c7\u7528\u4e0eGPT - 4.1\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "GPT - 4.1\u5728\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b8fF1\u503c\u4e3a61.53%\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u4e3a15.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Due to the extensive observation space\narising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though\nfundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to\ncapture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while\nCentralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from\nthe curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nTriple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method\ndesigned specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing\nplatforms.

This paper introduces Service-Oriented Quantum (SOQ), a\nnovel paradigm that reimagines quantum software systems through the lens of\nclassical service-oriented computing. Unlike prior approaches such as Quantum\nService-Oriented Computing (QSOC), which treat quantum capabilities as\nauxiliary components within classical systems, SOQ positions quantum services\nas autonomous, composable, and interoperable entities. We define the\nfoundational principles of SOQ, propose a layered technology stack to support\nits realization, and identify the key research and engineering challenges that\nmust be addressed, including interoperability, hybridity, pricing models,\nservice abstractions, and workforce development.

We argue that large\nreasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe\nmisalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit\nthat aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant\nperformance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline\nthat boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced\nmeta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing\nmeta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training\nsources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover,\nour method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts\nthat are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when\nthey are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our\nstrategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training\nefficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain\nbenchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over\n1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on\nAIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks.

To address\nthis, we introduce a partitioning scheme that simulates unseen conditions in an\ninductive setting (which is the most challenging), allowing attribute relevance\nto be assessed without access to semantic information from unseen classes.\nWithin this framework, we study two complementary feature-selection strategies\nand assess their generalisation.

In this context, it is widely believed that the Ring\nalgorithm for the AllReduce collective communication operation is optimal only\nfor large messages, while Recursive Doubling is preferable for small ones due\nto its logarithmic number of steps compared to the linear number for Ring. In\nthis paper, we challenge this long-held assumption and show that the Ring\nalgorithm can remain optimal even for short messages in ring-based GPU-to-GPU\ntopologies, once realistic propagation delays and link capacity constraints are\naccounted for. We find that the total propagation delay for both Ring and\nRecursive Doubling essentially sums to the same value, but the latter incurs\nsignificantly higher congestion due to longer hop counts, leading to increased\ncompletion times. This surprising result motivates our case for in-collective\nadaptive topologies, particularly in the context of emerging photonic\ninterconnects, which can break through the limitations of static topology\ndesigns at the collective communication granularity. We design a \\emph{simple\nand fast} heuristic for circuit-switching that enables Recursive Doubling to\nexploit dynamically reconfigurable photonic paths, carefully balancing\nreconfiguration delays, propagation latencies, and link congestion to minimize\noverall completion time. Our preliminary evaluations, using realistic\nreconfiguration delays, show that our circuit-switching schedules enable faster\ncompletion times for Recursive Doubling, even compared to Ring AllReduce on\nstatic ring topologies.

Despite its importance, developers\noften neglect refactoring due to the significant time, effort, and resources it\nrequires, as well as the lack of immediate functional rewards. Although several\nautomated refactoring tools have been proposed, they remain limited in\nsupporting a broad spectrum of refactoring types. In this study, we explore\nwhether instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines can\nenhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform diverse\nrefactoring tasks automatically. Leveraging the instruction-following and code\ncomprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-mini and\nDeepSeek-V3), we draw on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to design\nmultiple instruction strategies that encode motivations, procedural steps, and\ntransformation objectives for 61 well-known refactoring types. We evaluate\nthese strategies on benchmark examples and real-world code snippets from GitHub\nprojects.

We also delineate limits\nwhere fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon\nplanning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive,\nand reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with\ntargeted LLM assistance.\n  Keywords: small language models, agents, function calling, structured\noutputs, JSON Schema, guided decoding, LoRA/QLoRA, routing, energy efficiency,\nedge inference", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u5408\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6808\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSLM - \u7f3a\u7701\u3001LLM - \u540e\u5907\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5de5\u7a0b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528SLMs\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u4e13\u6709SLMs\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6808\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316SLM - \u7f3a\u7701\u3001LLM - \u540e\u5907\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u7a0b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cSLMs\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u5ec9\u4ef7\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4f7f\u7528SLMs\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u501f\u52a9LLM\u3002"}}

As such, developers need to be equipped with an\nin-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.\nUnfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers\nfrom imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant\neffort to accurately discern necessary permissions. This potentially leads to\nincorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially\nresulting in security violations and app failures.

While\nemerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated\nalso during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more\nproprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining\nremains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in\nmost frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different\nphases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the\nscientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding\nreasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during\npost-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm\ngeneralization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning\ncannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning\ndata-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when\nintroduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading\nreasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing\nfoundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT,\neven with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data\nallocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning\npatterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg\ngain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated\nonly after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing\naway the benefits of early reasoning injection.

As more complex systems, like smart healthcare,\nenergy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the\nshortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen\nin dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete,\nmessy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive,\nintelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of\nsignificantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done\nacross all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported\ncontextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are\nfound in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice\ninconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with\ndetails from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no\ncode AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept\nthe AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two\narchitectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the\ntraditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model.

Recently, many\nneural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task. These models seek\nto make inferences based on their training data. Consequently, they better\ndetect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle\nto detect those they have not. Developers seeking clones are, of course,\ninterested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature\nreview, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's\ngoal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of\ndifferent functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six\nstate-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative\nLLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments\nreveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models. LLMs\nperform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone\ndetection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up\nto 5% (average 3%) instead. We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive\nlearning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen\nfunctionality. We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring\nsimilarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during\ntraining. We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a\ncontrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive\nin-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between\nclones and non-clones.

However,\ndelivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online\nand web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on\nbackend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently,\neven when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction\nprocess, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that\nachieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success,\nsuch models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per\nmodel, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve\nresource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means\nmaintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and\noperational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified\nmodel capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages,\nreducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on\nunseen languages. A novel normalization technique significantly enhances model\ngeneralization, while few-shot learning experiments show that a small number of\noracle samples can replace large datasets, minimizing dependence on brute-force\ngenerators.

However, empirical evidence shows that\nrepresentations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of\nembedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover,\nexperimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream\nperformance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1)\nWhat causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To\naddress these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality\nalignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any\nconstraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.\nUnder the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall\ninto two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap\nconverges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result\nidentifies \\emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality\ngap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be\nperfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences\ndownstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We\nprove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be\nachieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u584c\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u6210\u56e0\u53ca\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u9525\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96f6\uff0c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e24\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u6700\u5c0f\u5939\u89d2\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u584c\u662f\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u914d\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human\nintelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a\ncritical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,\ncomplementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation\nframeworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not\nfirmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce\nC^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.\nC^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:\nconvergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code\ngeneration), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,\nstorytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived\nfrom social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise\n(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source\nmodels, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities.

We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to\nall agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal\nalphabet $\\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the\ncommunication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to\nretrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending\nqueries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the\ninformation on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no\nmore than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.\nWe develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal\ninformation leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two\ncommunication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of\nnetwork setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent\nagents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining\nagents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through\nan existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the\nsolution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.\nMoreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is\na PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is\nlarger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped\nuniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more\ncommunication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the\nentire feasible set through PSI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0b\u83b7\u53d6\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73af\u548c\u661f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u96c6\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6307\u5b9a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u4e0e\u975e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u53d1\u9001\u67e5\u8be2\u83b7\u53d6\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u73af\u548c\u661f\u578b\u4e24\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u9608\u503cPSI\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u901a\u8fc7PSI\u534f\u8bae\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u96c6\u518d\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u5927\u4e8e\u540d\u4e49\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0b\u83b7\u53d6\u89e3\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While analyzing the\ndecision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing\nattention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally\ninfeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the\nauto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose\nDecision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision\nboundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different\nsampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of\ndecision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent\nto the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision\nregions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an\napproximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which\nonly requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's\ndecision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper\nbounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration\nbetween K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be\ntrade-off with sampling times.

Although\npost-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly\ntransferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework\ntailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the\nfully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked\nCalibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent\nmasking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a\nData-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight\nrepresentations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative\napproximation guided by our simulated calibration data.

One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more\naccurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as\nensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking\nat ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical\nframework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to\n\"abstain\" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of\nthe threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of\nthe remaining answers.

In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for\n1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit\nquantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.\nA distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the\nOver-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM\nconstraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal\ntrade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined\nwith Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding\nhigh-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the\nmultiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach\nsignificantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit\nquantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we\nincorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving\nthe stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to\nfully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing\nthe correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we\npropose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,\nMultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each\nlayer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a\nmore efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive\nlow-OSR settings.

While Item Response Theory (IRT) offers a promising\npath toward data-efficient evaluation by disentangling model capability from\nitem difficulty, existing IRT-based methods are hampered by significant\nlimitations. They are typically restricted to binary correctness metrics,\nfailing to natively handle the continuous scores used in generative tasks, and\nthey operate on single benchmarks, ignoring valuable structural knowledge like\ncorrelations across different metrics or benchmarks. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce LEGO-IRT, a unified and flexible framework for\ndata-efficient LLM evaluation. LEGO-IRT's novel design natively supports both\nbinary and continuous evaluation metrics.

Under review", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the\nnuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate\nemotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely\nunexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within\nmodern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their\nneural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit\ncorpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic\nemotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and\nsynthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight \"probes\" to\nread out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models\nwithout altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a\nsurprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with\nmodel scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate\nthat this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early\nand peaks mid-network.

Yet, this\nintegration raises critical concerns about value alignment - ensuring AI\nbehaviors remain consistent with human ethics and intentions. A key risk is\nvalue drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving\ncontexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading\nto inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System\n(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI\nagents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,\nLSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for\nadaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent\nbreaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised\nfine-tuning with human feedback.

For\nDirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct\nunivariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode\nboundary information at the activation level of the network.

This research proposes a hybrid\nattribution and pruning (HAP) framework that uses attribution patching to\nidentify a high-potential subgraph, then applies edge pruning to extract a\nfaithful circuit from it. We show that HAP is 46\\% faster than baseline\nalgorithms without sacrificing circuit faithfulness.

Second, GUISpector\nsystematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification\nprocess, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to\niteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code\ngeneration in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that\nunifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for\nsupervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the\nend-to-end requirements verification process.

Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries\nfrom the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL,\nleading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements\nin code coverage (up to 13.90%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6InsightQL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u652f\u6301\u53c8\u5f88\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7531\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u76f4\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u63a5\u53e3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684InsightQL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u3002", "result": "\u5728FuzzBench\u57fa\u51c6\u768414\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cInsightQL\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534713.90%\u3002", "conclusion": "InsightQL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u963b\u585e\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

We present UniPruning, a\nunified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local\nsaliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror\ndescent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning\nleverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to\nallocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and\nsemi-structured N :M pruning within one framework.

We present a principled\nBayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over\n$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success\nprobability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent\ndecision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical\n(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the\nposterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of\nprior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the\nBayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),\nexplaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.\nEmpirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on\nAIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster\nconvergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,\nenabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts.

However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like\nFlux, established erasure methods (\\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit\ndegraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through\nsystematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of\n``amnesia\": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling\ntrajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally\nreversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety\nfrom genuine concept removal.

To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph\nmoments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This\nenables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct\ngenerative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph\nlearning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data\naugmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided\nby the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2)\nFor GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally,\nby introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL)\nimproves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other\nmodels.

We study this\nquestion using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via\nsmall-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational\nsemantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written,\nLLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by\ncode-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes.\nGiven a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are\nevaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state\nprediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction.\nTo distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two\nnonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard\nrules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard\nsemantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that\n(i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models\nperform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about\nhighly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and\nsurprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but\noften hurts on more complex ones.

Prior work has explored\narchitecture variants and data treatments such as dataset filtering and noise\ninjection in language model pretraining; however, these studies have not\nformalized data quality within a principled scaling law. We introduce a\ndimensionless data-quality parameter Q, and propose a quality-aware scaling law\nextending the Chinchilla framework to predict loss as a joint function of model\nsize, data volume, and data quality. The law is motivated by an\neffective-sample-size and information-theoretic view of noisy or redundant\ncorpora, and it admits two practical estimators for Q: (i) a corruption rate\nproxy and (ii) a deficiency measure. Through synthetic experiments in neural\nmachine translation and autoregressive modeling -- where we systematically\ncontrol data quality via multiple levels of noise injection and coverage\nvariation -- we show that loss scales predictably with data quality and that\nhigher-quality data can substantially reduce model size and hence compute\nrequirements. Our results demonstrate a sublinear decay of effective data with\nquality and robustness to moderate data corruption; out-of-sample evaluations\nfurther validate the predictive form of the law.

Training a\ndiffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different\nnoise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules\nand proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To\ncapture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by\ntransforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,\nthe denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama\nalgorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the\neffect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the\noptimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over\n$SO(3)$. Alignment corresponds to sampling the mode of this distribution, and\nturns out to be the zeroth order approximation for small noise levels,\nexplaining its effectiveness.

However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating\nunnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which\nsubstantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing\nmethods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they\nincur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when\nrewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative\nadvantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging\nvalid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward\nsignals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,\nshielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is\ngrounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which\nmaximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative\nobjective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling\nefficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy\ndata and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is\ngeneral and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond\nlength.

Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more\nimpatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent\nperformance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks\nfail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard\nevaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors.

It\nrelies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading\nto frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an\nalternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and\ngame trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python\ncode. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal\nmove enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation\nengine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search\n(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions\n(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden\nstates in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct\nadvantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:\nThe generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,\nallowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal\nmoves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic\nDepth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of\nclassical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the\nmeta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more\neasily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and\ncreated for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect\ninformation), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information).

Climate model output emulators address this gap by\noffering inexpensive surrogates that can rapidly explore alternative futures\nwhile staying close to Earth System Model (ESM) behavior. We focus on emulators\ndesigned to provide inputs to impact models. Using monthly ESM fields of\nnear-surface temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed, we\nshow that deep generative models have the potential to model jointly the\ndistribution of variables relevant for impacts. The specific model we propose\nuses score-based diffusion on a spherical mesh and runs on a single mid-range\ngraphical processing unit. We introduce a thorough suite of diagnostics to\ncompare emulator outputs with their parent ESMs, including their probability\ndensities, cross-variable correlations, time of emergence, or tail behavior. We\nevaluate performance across three distinct ESMs in both pre-industrial and\nforced regimes. The results show that the emulator produces distributions that\nclosely match the ESM outputs and captures key forced responses. They also\nreveal important failure cases, notably for variables with a strong regime\nshift in the seasonal cycle. Although not a perfect match to the ESM, the\ninaccuracies of the emulator are small relative to the scale of internal\nvariability in ESM projections.

Currently, the\nmajority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to\nsupport the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great\nsuccess, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding\nperformance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a\npseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods\ncannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus\nproducing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the\nteacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity\nsamples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and\nfurther achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above\nlimitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional\npseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).\nThe primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images\nfor pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to\ndistinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing\npseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to\nenhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets\nvalidate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by\nCPSC-DFKD.

At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and\nsycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect\nmathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the\napplicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed\nproofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing\nbenchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus\nsolely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated\ndatasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that\ncreate ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are\ndemonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first\nbenchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of\nnatural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025\ncompetition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false\nstatements and subsequently refined through expert review.

The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs\nto be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for\na careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second\nchallenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage\nsuch a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely\ndeployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to\nmonitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and\noperations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need\nto be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third\nchallenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in\nsuch settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real\ntime) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous\ntime-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a\nunified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly\nDetection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection\non very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that\nautomates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for\neach use case.

Across a range of models, we find a significant positive\ncorrelation between ToM and in-game success.

Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model\noutputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent\nchallenge.

Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures\nhave been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this\npaper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN\narchitectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model.

Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep\nlearning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and\ndistribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation\n(DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from\nsource domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while\nmitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan\nengines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data,\nand slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA\ntechniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need,\nthis paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine\nRUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent\nadvancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced,\norganizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied),\nalignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational\nvariations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address\nspecific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes\nbeyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive\ncharacteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA\ntechniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on\nturbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and\nidentifying key challenges.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model\nmerging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem\nbetween the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by\ndynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone\nmodels that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and\nimplicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the\ndecoding of the base model from Stage 1.

Stable and unstable\nmanifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a\ndynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their\nintersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce\na novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on\npiecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as\ntheir activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to\ntrace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to\ncharacterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further\nshow its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections\nbetween stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of\nchaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological\nrecordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics\ncould be gained through our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PLRNNs\uff09\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u523b\u753b\u591a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u5bbf\u70b9\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7535\u751f\u7406\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08RNNs\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0cRNN\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d41\u5f62\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u91c7\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u5143\uff08ReLUs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684PLRNNs\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5438\u5f15\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u591a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u540c\u5bbf\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePLRNNs\u4e2d\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7535\u751f\u7406\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ee5\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3PLRNNs\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7535\u751f\u7406\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a\n\"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values\nin EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a\nmissing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart\nreviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients\nwhose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of\na roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification\nof Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing\nvalues. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap\nfrom our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined\nusing large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to\nexpand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients\nfrom the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm\nperformance with different roadmaps.

Instead of treating the objective as a monolithic black box, BONSAI\nrepresents it as a directed graph of interconnected white- and black-box\ncomponents, allowing the algorithm to utilize intermediate information within\nthe optimization process. We further propose a scalable Thompson sampling-based\nacquisition function tailored to the structured RO setting, which can be\nefficiently optimized using gradient-based methods. We evaluate BONSAI across a\ndiverse set of synthetic and real-world case studies, including applications in\nprocess systems engineering. Compared to existing simulation-based RO\nalgorithms, BONSAI consistently delivers more sample-efficient and\nhigher-quality robust solutions, highlighting its practical advantages for\nuncertainty-aware design in complex engineering systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6BONSAI\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u96be\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BONSAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cBONSAI\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "BONSAI\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

AI4TS Workshop, IJCAI'25", "summary": "Time series anomaly detection forms a very crucial area in several domains\nbut poses substantial challenges. Due to time series data possessing\nseasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes\nvery difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior.\nAnomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to\ncontextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the\ndataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to\nthe problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time\ndetection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving\nat results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges,\nvery strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper\npresents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that\nexploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts\nembeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and\napplies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral\nDecomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data.

We develop a 24-48 h\nearly-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using\nonly open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the\npublicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves\nconvective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific\nkriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes,\nand builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW\nspatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture\nadvection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design,\ncombining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and\nreduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based\nhits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour\nwindows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by\nhourly moving-block bootstrap.\n  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows\n(e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra\nfalse alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at\n+/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48\nh (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP\nanalysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the\nvalue of the feature engineering.

However,\nits success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct\nsolutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a\nzero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this\nscenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and\nevaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense\nrewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments\nshow that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base\nmodel never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple\ndata-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables\nthe model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero\nreward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself.\nBecause official implementations of several baselines were unavailable, we\ndeveloped our own, which allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of their\nfailure modes.

This\napproach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating\nabundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven\nway to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has\nlargely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the\nequally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher\noutputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge\nbecomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may\nbenefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with\na systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first\nshow that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the\nhighest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come\nfrom multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with\ndownstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers\nbecome longer.

Existing methods, whether\nreconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based\n(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level\nmatching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely\noverlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal\nRGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D\nand RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.\nDespite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a\ncomprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer.

Based on these findings,\nwe propose an Adaptive RAI Governance (ARGO) Framework that balances central\ncoordination with local autonomy through three interdependent layers: shared\nfoundation standards, central advisory resources, and contextual local\nimplementation.

A Two-Stage Dynamic View", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves\nsampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,\nresulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate\nthat prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning\nstrategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary.

To tackle this\nproblem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training\ndata points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative\nmodels. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained\nsettings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal\nobjective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can\nprevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a\npre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed\nmethod, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally\nefficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data\ncontaining undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational\ninference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting\nof two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer\nreduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the\nstability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation\nquality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the\neffectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class\nunlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some\nuser-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a\npre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).\nSimilarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain\nhigh-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9632\u6b62\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u542b\u4e0d\u826f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u6269\u6563\u9057\u5fd8\uff08VDU\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVDU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d7\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u542b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5668\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9MNIST\u3001CIFAR - 10\u3001tinyImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7c7b\u9057\u5fd8\u548cStable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VDU\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u542b\u4e0d\u826f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

It shows that cross-entropy loss\ndecreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones.

These vectors are used to\nsuccessfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and\nImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with\nthe predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million\nclasses illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets\nwith extremely large number of classes.

Tuning hyperparameters is a\nmanual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows\ncombinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an\nend-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central\nagents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters.\nOur approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to\ndraw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this\nperspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the\nsystem for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and\ncentral servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from\nnumerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated\nlearning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are\ndynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By\ndesigning a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and\ncentral agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of\nheterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client\ndrift.

Designing such\nmissions requires rapid exploration of the tradespace between control cost and\nflight time across multiple candidate targets. However, multi-objective\noptimization in this setting is challenging, as the underlying constraints are\noften highly nonconvex, and mission designers must balance accuracy (e.g.,\nsolving the full problem) with efficiency (e.g., convex relaxations), slowing\niteration and limiting design agility. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AI-powered framework that enables agile mission design for a wide\nrange of Earth orbit rendezvous scenarios. Given the orbital information of the\ntarget spacecraft, boundary conditions, and a range of flight times, this work\nproposes a Transformer-based architecture that generates, in a single\nparallelized inference step, a set of near-Pareto optimal trajectories across\nvarying flight times, thereby enabling rapid mission trade studies. The model\nis further extended to accommodate variable flight times and perturbed orbital\ndynamics, supporting realistic multi-objective trade-offs. Validation on\nchance-constrained rendezvous problems with passive safety constraints\ndemonstrates that the model generalizes across both flight times and dynamics,\nconsistently providing high-quality initial guesses that converge to superior\nsolutions in fewer iterations. Moreover, the framework efficiently approximates\nthe Pareto front, achieving runtimes comparable to convex relaxation by\nexploiting parallelized inference.

RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters\nthe scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation\nfrom quadratic ($O(N^2 \\cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \\cdot T)$) with respect to\nthe number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory\nupdates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and\neconomically viable long-form conversations.

Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two\nopposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system\n(e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing\nvast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances\nof any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting\n(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data\nbased on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a\ncurriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,\nchaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent\nand attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first\ntraining a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more\nchaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable\nrepresentation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that\npre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world\nbenchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and\nhuman ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40%\ncompared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training\non real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across\nvarious neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations\nto validate the importance of the curriculum's structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6df7\u6c8c\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CCF\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6309\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCCF\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5927Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u6df7\u6c8c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u8d8550\u4e2a\u5408\u6210ODE/PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u592a\u9633\u9ed1\u5b50\u6570\u3001\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4eba\u4f53ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCCF\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5ef6\u957f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u671f\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "CCF\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the\nxAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional\ntraining compute.

MonitorVLM introduces\nthree key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000\nvision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining\nregulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a\nclause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant\nclauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\\% while maintaining accuracy; and\n(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve\nfine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in\nprecision and 8.62% in recall.

This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by\nexponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during\ndiffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a\nnovel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction\ntasks.

We provide guarantees of robust forward\ninvariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation\nprojection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state\nKL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity\nresults for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region\nimprovement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence\nunder expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free,\nmicrostructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\\to$ Dupire $\\to$ VIX with\nABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading\ncentral performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP\nis feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and\nincident workflows to support explainability and auditability.

However, current GFMs are\nchallenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can\npossess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two\nmain paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs),\nbut is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical\nfeatures in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the\nadaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage,\ncreating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these\nlimitations and introduce \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{I}n-context \\textbf{L}earning\n\\textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free\narchitecture.

These applications commonly run on edge and mobile devices, where energy\nbudgets, memory, and compute are strictly limited. Continual learning (CL)\naddresses such dynamics by training models sequentially on task streams while\npreserving prior knowledge and consolidating new knowledge. While recent CL\nwork has advanced in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving knowledge\ntransfer, the practical requirements of energy and memory efficiency for\ntabular data streams remain underexplored. In particular, existing CL solutions\nmostly depend on replay mechanisms whose buffers grow over time and exacerbate\nresource costs.\n  We propose a context-aware incremental Multi-Layer Perceptron (IMLP), a\ncompact continual learner for tabular data streams.

The attended\ncontext is concatenated with current features and processed by shared\nfeed-forward layers, yielding lightweight per-segment updates. To assess\npractical deployability, we introduce NetScore-T, a tunable metric coupling\nbalanced accuracy with energy for Pareto-aware comparison across models and\ndatasets. IMLP achieves up to $27.6\\times$ higher energy efficiency than TabNet\nand $85.5\\times$ higher than TabPFN, while maintaining competitive average\naccuracy.

Across\narchitectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a\nnon-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing\nthis quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay,\nsmaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the\neffective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work\nthat connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual\nminima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when\nindependently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the\nunderstanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its\ndownstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of\nfurther manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4f7f\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8be5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a2\u7a76\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6027\u662f\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6700\u4f18\u503c\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u8282\u6709\u6548\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u5851\u9020\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u64cd\u7eb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Achieving\nthe goal of \"train once, infer across scenarios\" remains a fundamental\nchallenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot\ngeneralization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying\nlengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without\nretraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and\nself-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot\ncapabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data,\nthey face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we\npropose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time\nseries curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images,\ntemporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size,\nthereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without\ncontext constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique\nchallenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text\ndata. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically\ngenerate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage\ntraining pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2)\nanomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement.

LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of\nspecific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important\nresearch area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based\nmethods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by\nNegative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited\nby its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to\nintroduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate\ndomain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting\ntheir generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the\ndistribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution\ninstead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed\n\\textbf{Di}stribution \\textbf{P}reference \\textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO).

These\nsystems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and\nconversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on\nclicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.\nHowever, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a\nsubstantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address\nthis issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While\nthese frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked\nand non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics.

We\nidentify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk\nunique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises\nwhen continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints\nestablished during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies.\nWe formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms:\nSelf-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce\nindividual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant\nbehaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we\nconstruct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode\nrapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward\nunaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse\nquickly, leading to collective misalignment.

It relies\nheavily on vast datasets and significant computational resources for high\nperformance. This data often contains sensitive information, making privacy a\nmajor concern in deep learning. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as\nan energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning approaches.\nNevertheless, SNNs still depend on large volumes of data, inheriting all the\nprivacy challenges of deep learning. Homomorphic encryption addresses this\nchallenge by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, ensuring\ndata confidentiality throughout the entire processing pipeline. In this paper,\nwe introduce PRIVSPIKE, a privacy-preserving inference framework for SNNs using\nthe CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. PRIVSPIKE supports arbitrary depth SNNs\nand introduces two key algorithms for evaluating the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire\nactivation function: (1) a polynomial approximation algorithm designed for\nhigh-performance SNN inference, and (2) a novel scheme-switching algorithm that\noptimizes precision at a higher computational cost. We evaluate PRIVSPIKE on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, Neuromorphic MNIST, and CIFAR-10 DVS using models from LeNet-5\nand ResNet-19 architectures, achieving encrypted inference accuracies of\n98.10%, 79.3%, 98.1%, and 66.0%, respectively. On a consumer-grade CPU, SNN\nLeNet-5 models achieved inference times of 28 seconds on MNIST and 212 seconds\non Neuromorphic MNIST. For SNN ResNet-19 models, inference took 784 seconds on\nCIFAR-10 and 1846 seconds on CIFAR-10 DVS.

To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on\ntwo data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the\nfull set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our\nframework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis\nand a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii)\ndomain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a\ngeneral-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral,\nDeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained\ninterconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces\ninterconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different\ndiseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based\napproaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential\nfor discovering new interconnections.

When the hyperparameters are tuned on\nsensitive data, privacy becomes an important challenge and to this end,\ndifferential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for provable privacy.\nA standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients\nagree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters,\nlike the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on\ndifferentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally\nexpensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for\neach client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to\nundesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.\n  In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed\nand privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting\nbased on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE\nselects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of\nclients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning\ntasks. We prove that DP-HYPE preserves the strong notion of differential\nprivacy called client-level differential privacy and, importantly, show that\nits privacy guarantees do not depend on the number of hyperparameters.

When parameters in the constraints of a COP are\npredicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions.\nTherefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and\ndecision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint\nparameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the\nunderlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear\nprogram (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption.

Fundamental momentum methods, such as\nNesterov Accelerated Gradient and the Heavy Ball method, as well as more recent\noptimizers such as AdamW and Lion, all rely on the momentum coefficient that is\ncustomarily set to $\\beta = 0.9$ and kept constant during model training, a\nstrategy widely used by practitioners, yet suboptimal. In this paper, we\nintroduce an \\textit{adaptive memory} mechanism that replaces constant momentum\nwith a dynamic momentum coefficient that is adjusted online during\noptimization.

For novice programmers in\nparticular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to\ncode, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept\nworks, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic\nchoices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language\nmodels on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and\nparticularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8\nmillion programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online\neducational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts.\nCompared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated\ntraces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling\ndiverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also\nfind that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number\nof comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who\nwrite them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover\nfrom mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of\nedits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the\noriginal student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of\ncode are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can\nlead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior\nwhile programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.\nCode and data is available at https://github.com/meghabyte/pencilcode-public", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u542b380\u591a\u4e07\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u8005\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Pencil Code\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u591a\u6837\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb8\u591a\u4ee3\u7801\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u4e2a\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8f91\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e14\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

By transforming the flat, high-dimensional\nprediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a\nbeneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem\nfor the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive\nexperiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%\nand significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL\nfrom 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the\nprediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable\ngenerative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMASC\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u8bcd\u6c47\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faManifold - Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u6811\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u805a\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe57%\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eLlamaGen - XL\u7684FID\u4ece2.87\u52302.58\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\uff0cMASC\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709AR\u6846\u67b6\u6781\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches that achieve sufficient quality for music production\noften rely on high-dimensional latent representations that are difficult to\nnavigate and provide unintuitive user experiences. We address this limitation\nthrough a two-stage training paradigm: first, we train a pitch-timbre\ndisentangled 2D representation of audio samples using a Variational\nAutoencoder; second, we use this representation as conditioning input for a\nTransformer-based generative model. The learned 2D latent space serves as an\nintuitive interface for navigating and exploring the sound landscape. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns a disentangled timbre\nspace, enabling expressive and controllable audio generation with reliable\npitch conditioning. Experimental results show the model's ability to capture\nsubtle variations in timbre while maintaining a high degree of pitch accuracy.\nThe usability of our method is demonstrated in an interactive web application,\nhighlighting its potential as a step towards future music production\nenvironments that are both intuitive and creatively empowering:\nhttps://pgesam.faresschulz.com", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u4e50\u5668\u58f0\u97f3\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u97f3\u8272\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u4e50\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u4e50\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u5bfc\u822a\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u76f4\u89c2\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6837\u672c\u7684\u97f3\u9ad8 - \u97f3\u8272\u89e3\u8026\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u97f3\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u97f3\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u97f3\u8272\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u5236\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL\nmethods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent\nproperties of their learned features with transformer backbones.

Because exact reward computation over paraphrase\nsets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation\nmethod that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale\ntraining.

Prior work has explored adversarial attacks\nfor hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic\nprompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original\nmeaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how\nhallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer\nvision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of\nfinding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has\nremained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically\nEquivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic\nmodifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining\nsemantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding\nrealistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization\nproblem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence\nconstraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to\neffectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we\ndemonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question\nanswering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring\nalmost no constraint violations compared to existing methods.

These models have demonstrated\nstrong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video\nunderstanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these\nnoteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects\ncorrectly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,\nVLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric\nshapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively\non counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict\nindependent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple\nproperties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.\nOur empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one\nshape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape\ntypes are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a\nfundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important\ndirections for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u51c6VLMCountBench\u7814\u7a76VLMs\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u8ba1\u6570\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8VLMs\u80fd\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u8ba1\u6570\u7269\u4f53\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VLMCountBench\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u72ec\u7acb\u53d8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "VLMs\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u65f6\u8ba1\u6570\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u5927\u91cf\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Prior\nworks such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)\nshrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill\nand training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional\nAttention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,\nand values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent\nspace. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all\nat once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to\nhead-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query\nAttention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier\nso that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without\nsacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both\nGQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.\nAdditionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE\nmodels with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache\ncompression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA\nalso dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to\nsubstantially faster training and prefill than existing methods.

In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree\n(DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a\nmethodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best\nDT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could\nbe encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on\nlikelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results\nrevealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the\nLRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in\nnoisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which\ncase the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good\nperformance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA\ndata from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does\nnot necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the\nsignal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and\nother hypothesis testing methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u7ad9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bfc\u9891\u6c61\u67d3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08MMIMO\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a83\u542c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bfc\u9891\u6c61\u67d3\u653b\u51fb\uff08PCA\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff08DT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884cPCA\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u751f\u6210DT\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u6309\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u6700\u4f18DT\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08LRT\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6DT\u5c31\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eLRT\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u533a\u5206PCA\u548c\u975ePCA\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700LRT\u6240\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u68c0\u6d4bPCA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Novel contributions include a generalized patching algorithm\nfor multi-threat detection, three groundbreaking hypotheses on threat\ninteractions (e.g., threat chaining in enterprise workflows), and a\ndeployment-ready toolkit with APIs for enterprise integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165UTDMF\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6b3a\u9a97\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u6218\u7565\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u6709\u504f\u8f93\u51fa\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u6297\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8865\u4e01\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165UTDMF\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c700\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "UTDMF\u5b9e\u73b092%\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300165%\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u8f93\u51fa\u51cf\u5c11\u548c78%\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8865\u4e01\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5173\u4e8e\u5a01\u80c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u53ef\u4f9b\u4f01\u4e1a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002"}}

Recent advances in statistical\nphysics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise\ncharacterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in\ninformation-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent\ncontrol protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that\nminimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we\ndevelop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation\nresponse relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that\noptimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both\nusing FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on\niteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much\neasier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing\nequations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a\ndouble-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to\nconstruct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The\nframework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by\noptimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test,\nthe framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work\ncosts comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide\nprincipled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in\nphysical information-processing systems.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a\nControllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled\ndataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the\nunlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a\nknown distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.\nSpecifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization\ncycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism\nselectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into\nthe labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known\ndistribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit\nadjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved\nclassifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next\ntraining step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can\nsignificantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.\nAdditionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further\nimprove the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to\nmaximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.\nComprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that\nCPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up\nto \\textbf{15.97\\%} in accuracy.

The medical question summary (MQS) task aims\nto transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs),\nbut existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of\nquestion focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning\nis prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this\nend, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First,\na prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from\nthe CHQs that is faithful to the original text.

Finally, a multi-dimensional\nquality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively\nimprove the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions.

For zero-shot TTS, MAVE\nexceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without\nrequiring multiple inference runs or post-processing.

While\ntraditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches\nhave moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary\ntext queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in\ntext-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to\ncapture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs\nsignificant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present\nPG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables\nopen-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive\nonline densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D\nGaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively\nenhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and\ndetailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of\nan anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which\nadaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and\nstages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene\ninformation capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement\nover the previous best performing method.

However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in\nthe training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when\nactivated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate\nthe internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models,\nfocusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when\nprocessing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention\nand gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context.

However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely\nhigh inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this\nproblem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during\nboth training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based\narchitecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference,\nwhile still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse\nmulti-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is\nnontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that\nimprove its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from\nexisting vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation\nstrategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even\nhigher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation,\nwhile significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a\nstate-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters\nat test time by $90\\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\\times$.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/MasterXiong/HyperVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperVLA\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Vision - Language - Action (VLA) \u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc (HN) \u7684HyperVLA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c0f\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001HN\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u5f0fVLA\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHyperVLA\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u76f8\u8fd1\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4e0eOpenVLA\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1190\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb120\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperVLA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

While Active Learning (AL) offers a\nstrategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative\ndata, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.\nUnsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the\nannotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing\nUAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches\ntypically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance\nestimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data\nbut also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the\nfull data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear\nselection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the\nNatural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes\nhow sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature\nLearning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to\nmodel performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful\nReconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all\nestablished UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL\nmethods on vision datasets.

However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be\nmissing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression\nartifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view\ntranslation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike\nnatural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large\nnon-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which\nobscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and\nImplicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view\ntranslation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address\ncross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware\ncross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that\nanatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions\nacross views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise\ncorrelations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an\nimplicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents\ninto a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry.

However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are\noften woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This\nmakes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences\nin isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task.

We identify a critical\ndilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio\nreconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional\nLMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key\nlimitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective\nLMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ\nlayers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple\nisolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via\nreinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren\noutperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results. By bridging the representational strengths of LMs\nwith the fidelity demands of audio synthesis, our approach repositions LMs as\ncompetitive contenders against diffusion models in T2A tasks.

Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and\nAstrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual\nunderstanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average\nscores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing\nmodels) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top\ntwo among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated\n(2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more\ndivergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score,\nranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while\nother models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error\nanalysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial\nvisualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence,\nalthough LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps\nmust be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in\nastronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd55\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6587\u5965\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u8003\u8bd5\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u9876\u5c16\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u8003\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9645\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u9700\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u5929\u6587\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\uff08IOAA\uff09\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "Gemini 2.5 Pro\u548cGPT - 5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u91d1\u724c\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGPT - 5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u9876\u5c16\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u81ea\u4e3b\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under\nconstrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,\nwith larger gains as budgets tighten.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u7684SwiReasoning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548cSTEM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u963b\u788d\u6536\u655b\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u6d6a\u8d39\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SwiReasoning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u7ea7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u601d\u7ef4\u5757\u5207\u6362\u6700\u5927\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548cSTEM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSwiReasoning\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad81.5%-2.8%\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u8bb0\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad856%-79%\u3002", "conclusion": "SwiReasoning\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6f5c\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and\nGSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical\nanalyses to substantiate the advantages of our method.

Its goal was to assess\nhow well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt\nthrough local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development\nwithout sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to\nclassify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the\nmulti-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across\ncenters was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after\nfine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission\nachieved the strongest overall performance.

To address this issue, we propose\nTolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding\nstrategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens.

This design enables previously accepted\ntokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more\nreliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard\nbenchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.\nExperiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the\nbaselines under the same computational budget.

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience.
