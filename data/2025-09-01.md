### [1] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究架构归纳偏差对大语言模型在教学对话中认知行为的影响，引入符号脚手架机制和短期记忆模式，评估模型输出，初步结果显示完整系统表现更好，架构支架可塑造教学策略。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究架构归纳偏差如何影响大语言模型在教学对话中的认知行为。

Method: 引入符号脚手架机制和短期记忆模式，对五个系统变体进行对照消融实验，用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，采用基于大语言模型的评估框架。

Result: 初步结果显示完整系统始终优于基线变体，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键认知行为。

Conclusion: 架构支架能可靠地塑造大语言模型中出现的教学策略。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

TL;DR: 评估两种GraphRAG系统在阿尔茨海默病领域的质量和可追溯性，与标准GPT - 4o模型对比，并提供易用界面及预建数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型聊天机器人在科研应用受限，GraphRAG有潜力但在阿尔茨海默病等领域评估研究有限。

Method: 编译50篇论文和70个专家问题数据库，构建GraphRAG知识库，用GPT - 4o回答查询，对比GraphRAG和标准GPT - 4o模型的回答质量，评估RAG和GraphRAG系统的可追溯性。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 提供易用界面和预建阿尔茨海默病数据库，方便研究人员测试标准RAG和GraphRAG性能。

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [4] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLM增强的集成本体学习框架LINKO，同时利用多个本体图，通过双轴知识传播增强医学概念表示学习，实验验证其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注单一本体系统或孤立使用多个本体系统的领域知识，未整合到统一学习结构，概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系，忽略跨本体连接。

Method: LINKO首先使用LLM为本体概念嵌入提供图检索增强的初始化，然后通过在两个轴上进行知识传播联合学习不同本体图中的医学概念，最后在两个公共数据集上进行实验。

Result: LINKO在实验中表现优于现有基线，作为插件编码器在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO是一种有效的集成本体学习框架，能增强医学概念表示学习，提高EHR预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

### [5] [Think in Games: Learning to Reason in Games via Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21365)
*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Think in Games (TiG)框架让大语言模型通过游戏交互获程序知识，性能优且数据和计算需求低，决策有解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在简单交互任务表现差，传统强化学习有黑盒和数据量大问题，需弥合陈述性和程序性知识差距。

Method: 提出TiG框架，将基于强化学习的决策转化为语言建模任务，大语言模型生成语言引导策略并通过在线强化学习迭代优化。

Result: TiG成功弥合陈述性和程序性知识差距，与传统强化学习方法相比，以更低数据和计算需求取得有竞争力性能，决策有自然语言解释。

Conclusion: TiG框架有效解决大语言模型在交互任务的问题，提升复杂交互任务的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [6] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对音频语言模型缺乏标准化基准的问题，引入AHELM基准，测试多个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在部分方面表现好但有不公平问题，基线系统表现也不错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，多数基准仅测一两种能力，跨模型比较难。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，整合多个数据集，标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，测试14个开放权重和封闭API的音频语言模型及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面的5个中排名第一，但在ASR任务上有群体不公平问题；基线系统表现较好，一个排第5。

Conclusion: AHELM可全面评估音频语言模型，后续会添加新数据集和模型。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the
three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we
describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we
discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies
on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development
paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs
and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss
the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI
agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.
Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the
economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the
internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI
development.

### [9] [A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文从认知视角研究认知状态中的遗忘操作，提出五种认知遗忘类型和七种具体操作，给出评估公理并评估操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，本文想在有更丰富语义结构的认知状态中研究遗忘操作。

Method: 提出五种认知遗忘类型，为Spohn的排序函数实例化七种具体遗忘操作，借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论的公设提出评估公理。

Result: 对所有具体遗忘操作按公设进行评估，得到突出遗忘算子差异和共性的综合概述。

Conclusion: 从认知视角研究遗忘操作能提升已有和新颖的遗忘操作到认知层面，且可通过公设评估操作。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究从随机状态 - 动作轨迹学习滑动拼图的提升STRIPS模型问题，引入STRIPS+，提出SYNTH算法并验证其正确性、完整性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往解决模型学习问题的方法大多假设轨迹中的动作是完整的STRIPS动作或领域谓词均可观察，本文考虑更“现实”的设置。

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，提出SYNTH算法为每个动作构建前提条件表达式序列。

Result: 建立了SYNTH算法的正确性和完整性，在从现有STRIPS领域导出的STRIPS+模型的状态 - 动作轨迹上测试了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: SYNTH算法可用于从STRIPS+状态 - 动作轨迹学习STRIPS+模型。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MMSearch - Plus基准测试，评估多模态语言模型在多模态浏览任务中的表现并进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态浏览基准测试难以体现真正的多模态挑战，需要新基准测试评估多模态语言模型能力。

Method: 引入MMSearch - Plus基准测试，采用Spatial - Temporal Extrapolation策构建任务，提供模型无关的代理框架评估多种模型。

Result: 最强代理o3无搜索时准确率15.1%，有搜索时36.0%；开源模型Qwen - 2.5 - VL - 72B - Instruct无搜索时0.0%，20轮搜索后6.9%，还评估了边界框生成和裁剪图像搜索。

Conclusion: 通过错误分析发现模型在源验证、基于部分的推理和长期规划方面存在失败情况。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出用含Z数的模糊推理系统测量智慧，经实验验证该系统有一定有效性，还可助力AI推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智慧测量依赖自我报告，很少体现智慧推理中的谦逊和不确定性，需一个考虑多维性和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学和实现人道AI。

Method: 提出含Z数的模糊推理系统，让100名参与者完成文化中立的图片道德困境任务并进行出声思考，将其反应映射到智慧的五个理论成分，用21条规则结合各成分得分，通过高斯核密度估计调整隶属函数。

Result: 系统产生的双属性智慧表征与现有量表有适度但显著的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了聚合和区分效度。

Conclusion: 将智慧形式化为多维、考虑不确定性的结构，以Z数形式实现，推动了心理学测量，还能为AI系统提供可解释、对置信度敏感的推理。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

TL;DR: 介绍HealthProcessAI框架简化医疗过程挖掘应用，用脓毒症数据验证，多LLM助力，评估显示不同模型优势，可使结果更易理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过程挖掘在医疗应用中面临的技术复杂、缺乏标准方法和实用培训资源等障碍，解决用户对过程挖掘输出不熟悉的问题。

Method: 构建HealthProcessAI框架，整合Python和R库，集成多个LLM进行自动流程地图解释和报告生成，用脓毒症数据验证，通过OpenRouter平台比较五个LLM模型。

Result: 框架成功处理脓毒症数据，展示强大技术性能；Claude Sonnet - 4和Gemini 2.5 - Pro在自动化LLM评估中一致性得分最高。

Conclusion: 该框架结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，是将复杂过程挖掘结果转化为医疗可操作见解的新方法进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Motivation: 传统地标提取算法在规划问题的中间目标描述上存在不足，需要新方法来发现能跨领域泛化的地标。

Method: 从已解决实例中学习泛化地标，使用与特定问题对象无关的状态函数，构建有向泛化地标图并用于启发式。

Result: 小实例学习的泛化地标图对同领域大实例有效，识别出重复循环时启发式性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 泛化地标能捕捉可解释且对自动规划器有用的领域信息，可从少量同领域规划中发现。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将Multi - Heuristic A* (MHA*)扩展为随时可用版本A - MHA*，使其能快速找到可行次优解并持续改进，还在相关领域测试了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始MHA*是一次性算法，无法随时间改进解，需要仔细设置膨胀因子来获得单次解，因此要将其扩展为随时可用版本。

Method: 受Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*)算法启发，将ARA*概念精确应用到MHA*框架中。

Result: 证明了在MHA*框架中应用ARA*概念能保留原有的次优性和完整性保证，使MHA*能随时运行，并在3 - D路径规划和滑动拼图领域测试了A - MHA*性能。

Conclusion: 成功将MHA*扩展为随时可用版本A - MHA*，该版本能快速找到可行次优解并持续改进，且在相关领域有较好表现。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 传统认为医疗AI偏差需消除，本文提出MEDLEY框架，保留多AI模型多样输出，开发概念验证演示器，说明结构化多样性可在临床监督下增强医疗推理，为医疗AI发展开辟新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为医疗AI偏差需消除，但人类推理本身存在偏差且可能有价值，所以提出新框架以更好利用AI偏差。

Method: 提出MEDLEY概念框架，用超30个大语言模型开发概念验证演示器。

Result: 创建最小可行产品，在合成案例中保留共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏差透明。

Conclusion: 虽未经验证为临床工具，但说明结构化多样性可在临床监督下增强医疗推理，MEDLEY框架为医疗AI发展带来范式转变。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视科学文档层次结构和文本与视觉元素的语义集成，需解决这两个挑战。

Result: 在多学术领域实验中，定性和定量评估均优于现有基线，海报质量接近专家设计，信息保留、结构清晰度和用户偏好表现出色。

Conclusion: PosterForest框架有效，能提升科学海报自动生成的质量。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出可在NISQ硬件上快速实现的TSP变分算法，减少测试中昂贵的结构搜索。

Method: 结合紧凑排列编码和优化-冻结-重用策略，先通过模拟退火在训练实例上优化电路拓扑，再冻结并在新实例上仅优化参数。

Result: 在4 - 7个城市的随机对称实例上测试，4、5、6个城市时平均最优行程采样概率分别为100%、90%、80%，7个城市时成功率降至约20%。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等问题规模上有强大泛化能力，冻结电路拓扑可大幅减少求解时间且不降低解的质量，同时讨论了可扩展性等问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

Method: 提出在总结因果图编码的背景知识和特定分布假设下，保证微观层面边可定向的条件。

Result: 结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使宏观层面存在循环或双向边。

Conclusion: 研究结果为利用总结因果图进行复杂时间系统的因果发现提供实践指导，强调了结合专家知识改进观测时间序列数据因果推断的价值。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度引导在非凸目标等现实场景效果不佳，现有监督规划方法限制测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时间规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程，先通过无训练粒子引导生成多样父轨迹，再通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪细化子轨迹。

Result: TDP在迷宫采金、机械臂块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三项任务上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TDP框架能有效解决现有方法的局限性，具有良好效果。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

Motivation: 临床叙事解读自动化有挑战，单模型方法在高风险临床任务中缺乏鲁棒性，需新方法。

Method: 引入模拟临床咨询团队的MAS，由管理智能体协调专家智能体团队，分析SOAP笔记的S和O部分，通过分层迭代辩论达成共识。

Result: 在420份MIMIC - III笔记数据集上，动态多智能体配置在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面性能更好，辩论能有效权衡冲突证据，但偶有群体思维。

Conclusion: 该系统为更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Motivation: 3D有限元模拟心血管流动计算成本高，传统降阶模型在血管分叉处精度低，需改进模型以平衡精度与效率。

Method: 开发RRI模型，用神经网络从分叉几何预测压力 - 流量关系，采用无量纲化减少训练数据需求，基于优化策略将RRI模型融入0D模型。

Conclusion: 这种混合数值方法可用于心血管生物医学工程临床决策支持、不确定性量化和数字孪生的准确实时血流动力学建模。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

Abstract: In a recent work, we proposed a graph-based manifold learning scheme for the
nonlinear Galerkin-reduction of quasi-static solid mechanical problems [1]. The
resulting nonlinear approximation spaces can closely and flexibly represent
nonlinear solution manifolds. The present work discusses how this nonlinear
model order reduction (MOR) approach can be employed to reduce online
computational costs by multiple orders of magnitude while retaining high levels
of accuracy. We integrate two popular hyperreduction methods into the nonlinear
MOR framework and discuss how we achieve an algorithmic complexity which is
independent from the original system size. Furthermore, improvements are made
to the local online linearisation scheme for the sake of performance and
robustness. On an example RVE problem, the MOR scheme accelerates computations
by more than two orders of magnitude with little training data and negligible
loss of accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm Pareto-dominates alternative
approaches in the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on the considered
example.

Abstract: Architected materials of significant geometric complexity offer exceptional
mechanical properties that often surpass those of their constituent materials.
However, their fabrication through extrusion-based 3D printing remains hindered
by suboptimal printing trajectories, which is inherent to commercial slicing
software. They produce multiple non-continuous paths that compromise
fabrication time, shape fidelity, and structural integrity, particularly for
thin-walled lattice structures. To address this issue, we introduce GIPPO
(Graph-based, Iterative, Printing-Path Optimization), an open-source slicing
platform that transforms complex lattice designs into optimized printing
trajectories. Lattices are converted to graph networks to derive the optimal
printing trajectories through a modified version of Prim's algorithm. The
resulting paths are translated back to Euclidean coordinates and exported as a
ready-to-use G-code. We validated GIPPO's performance against conventional
slicing software across six architected lattice geometries fabricated from
thermoplastic polyurethane using fused deposition modeling. GIPPO-optimized
constructs demonstrated superior shape fidelity with reduced local thickness
deviations, no missing struts, and minimized excess material deposition
compared to conventionally printed controls. Mechanical testing revealed that
printing path optimization directly influences both uniaxial and out-of-plane
mechanical responses, with different optimization strategies yielding distinct
performance characteristics suited to specific loading conditions. Moreover,
the platform accommodates both planar and non-planar printing geometries and
enables fabrication of objects with varying infill patterns per layer. Our work
addresses critical limitations in commercial slicing software and opens new
opportunities for high-fidelity fabrication of complex architected materials.

Result: 在基准和合成电商数据集上的实证评估显示，ORCA在表理解、查询生成和因果估计方面表现出色，在估计平均处理效果上比GPT - 4o mini提高超7倍。

Conclusion: ORCA系统能在保留专家监督的同时自动化RDBMS中的常规工作流，使数据驱动决策所需的统计计算技术专业知识减少，实现稳健决策。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making science while the
complexity of the data analysis workflow, ranging from data wrangling to causal
analysis, increases substantially as the scale of data grows in complicated
business environments. Especially, the execution of the workflow in relational
databases by non-experts can result in repetitive bottlenecks which impede
timely and responsible business insights. To address this challenge, we propose
ORCA (Orchestrating Causal Agent), an LLM agentic system that can automate
routine workflows in RDBMS while preserving expert oversight via human-AI
interactions. ORCA orchestrates the full data analysis pipeline: interpreting
natural language queries, navigating tables from DB servers, generating proper
SQL codes, preprocessing data, and configuring modeling processes using causal
inference libraries. Domain experts still can control the automation through
iterative interactions with ORCA, enabling robust data-driven decision making
with less technical expertise in statistical computing. Empirical evaluations
on benchmark and synthetic e-commerce datasets demonstrate competitive
performance of ORCA in table understanding, query generation, and cause-effect
estimation -- achieving over $7\times$ improvement in estimating average
treatment compared to GPT-4o mini.

Abstract: We report our participation in the SISAP 2025 Indexing Challenge using a
novel indexing technique called the Hilbert forest. The method is based on the
fast Hilbert sort algorithm, which efficiently orders high-dimensional points
along a Hilbert space-filling curve, and constructs multiple Hilbert trees to
support approximate nearest neighbor search. We submitted implementations to
both Task 1 (approximate search on the PUBMED23 dataset) and Task 2 (k-nearest
neighbor graph construction on the GOOAQ dataset) under the official resource
constraints of 16 GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. The Hilbert forest demonstrated
competitive performance in Task 1 and achieved the fastest construction time in
Task 2 while satisfying the required recall levels. These results highlight the
practical effectiveness of Hilbert order-based indexing under strict memory
limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的张量核心计算吞吐量高，此前仅用FP64计算欧氏距离，且FP16 - 32会使张量核心数据饥饿，希望挖掘其在欧氏距离计算中的潜力。

Method: 提出FaSTED算法，设计数据分层重用，最大化各层级内存利用率，应用于相似性搜索场景。

Result: 在四个128 - 960维的真实高维数据集上，混合精度暴力法比现有算法提速2.5 - 51倍，精度损失小于0.06%。

Conclusion: FaSTED算法在欧氏距离计算上有显著性能提升，且精度损失可接受。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效解决去中心化联邦学习中数据异构和掉队者问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

Motivation: HPC社区虽有激励机制，但很多论文不满足可重复性要求，HPC基础设施和软件的独特性及访问限制影响可重复性。

Method: 对可重复性倡议进行调查，分析HPC可重复性障碍，提出GitHub Action工具CORRECT用于在远程HPC资源上安全执行测试。

Result: 评估了CORRECT在三种不同类型HPC应用中的可用性，证明其在自动化和记录可重复性评估方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 更好的HPC合规CI解决方案可提高应用程序的可重复性。

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

Result: 在32卡集群实验中，恢复后与无故障训练性能差距在11.00%内，保持模型收敛和高效内存使用，比Oobleck和Recycle平均吞吐量分别高1.229x和1.355x。

Conclusion: Odyssey是一种有效的自适应容错系统，在大语言模型训练容错方面表现良好。

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory
usage. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Odyssey achieves up to 1.229x and
1.355x higher average throughput than Oobleck and Recycle, respectively.

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff能有效解决现有MoE模型卸载技术硬件利用率低的问题，提高解码吞吐量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

Result: 分析了低秩逼近和最小二乘回归的标准随机算法，找出多种OSI示例，带来更快运行时间。

Conclusion: 结构化随机矩阵为一系列合成问题和当代科学应用提供了出色性能，且论文给出了实现指导。

Abstract: To achieve the greatest possible speed, practitioners regularly implement
randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression
with structured dimension reduction maps. Despite significant research effort,
basic questions remain about the design and analysis of randomized linear
algebra algorithms that employ structured random matrices.
  This paper develops a new perspective on structured dimension reduction,
based on the oblivious subspace injection (OSI) property. The OSI property is a
relatively weak assumption on a random matrix that holds when the matrix
preserves the length of vectors on average and, with high probability, does not
annihilate any vector in a low-dimensional subspace. With the OSI abstraction,
the analysis of a randomized linear algebra algorithm factors into two parts:
(i) proving that the algorithm works when implemented with an OSI; and (ii)
proving that a given random matrix model has the OSI property.
  This paper develops both parts of the program. First, it analyzes standard
randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression
under the OSI assumption. Second, it identifies many examples of OSIs,
including random sparse matrices, randomized trigonometric transforms, and
random matrices with tensor product structure. These theoretical results imply
faster, near-optimal runtimes for several fundamental linear algebra tasks. The
paper also provides guidance on implementation, along with empirical evidence
that structured random matrices offer exemplary performance for a range of
synthetic problems and contemporary scientific applications.

Abstract: Subgraph isomorphism is a fundamental problem in graph analysis that seeks to
find all instances of a pattern graph within a larger data graph while
preserving structural relationships. This NP-complete problem is central to
domains such as biological network analysis, social network mining, and quantum
circuit optimization. Traditional approaches rely on backtracking algorithms
like VF2, which suffer from sequential bottlenecks that limit their ability to
exploit modern parallel hardware. In this work, we introduce $\Delta$-Motif, a
GPU-accelerated subgraph isomorphism algorithm that reformulates the task
through the lens of database operations. Our key insight is to represent both
data and pattern graphs in tabular form, turning subgraph isomorphism into
database primitives including joins, sorts, merges, and filters. $\Delta$-Motif
decomposes graphs into small building blocks called motifs and systematically
combines them using scalable relational operations. By leveraging mature,
optimized libraries from the NVIDIA RAPIDS ecosystem and Pandas framework, our
solution achieves massive parallelism while remaining portable across systems
supporting standard relational primitives. Benchmarks show that $\Delta$-Motif
outperforms established algorithms like VF2, achieving speedups of up to
$595\times$ on GPUs. We further demonstrate its impact by applying it to
quantum circuit compilation, addressing a critical bottleneck in quantum
computing and enabling scaling to near- and medium-term devices. Our approach
democratizes high-performance graph processing by exposing it through familiar
database abstractions, eliminating the need for low-level programming while
delivering exceptional computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 定制探索策略能在收入和效率指标上为平台带来显著收益。

Abstract: Sponsored search positions are typically allocated through real-time
auctions, where the outcomes depend on advertisers' quality-adjusted bids - the
product of their bids and quality scores. Although quality scoring helps
promote ads with higher conversion outcomes, setting these scores for new
advertisers in any given market is challenging, leading to the cold-start
problem. To address this, platforms incorporate multi-armed bandit algorithms
in auctions to balance exploration and exploitation. However, little is known
about the optimal exploration strategies in such auction environments. We
utilize data from a leading Asian mobile app store that places sponsored ads
for keywords. The platform employs a Thompson Sampling algorithm within a
second-price auction to learn quality scores and allocate a single sponsored
position for each keyword. We empirically quantify the gains from optimizing
exploration under this combined auction-bandit model and show that this problem
differs substantially from the canonical bandit problem. Drawing on these
empirical insights, we propose a customized exploration strategy in which the
platform adjusts the exploration levels for each keyword according to its
characteristics. We derive the Pareto frontier for revenue and efficiency and
provide actionable policies, demonstrating substantial gains for the platform
on both metrics when using a tailored exploration approach.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of
recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or
secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to
auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We
show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented
early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian
Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to
users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and
quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings
reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the
differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance
of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for
more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems
research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers
to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of
hyperparameter tuning workflows.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型有缺乏个性化和依赖云基础设施的问题，提出CDCDA - PLM框架解决，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型存在缺乏个性化和依赖云基础设施两大挑战，且少有研究同时解决这两个问题，需提出新方法。

Method: 提出CDCDA - PLM框架，利用服务器端大语言模型增强用户有限个人数据，通过参数高效微调模块微调个性化本地语言模型并部署到本地设备。

Result: 在广泛使用的个性化基准测试的六个任务中的实验结果，证明了CDCDA - PLM的有效性。

Conclusion: CDCDA - PLM框架能有效解决现有大语言模型缺乏个性化和依赖云基础设施的问题。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress
has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However,
existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader
adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization
tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure
due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network
dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on
either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device
deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both
limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language
models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying
personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a
powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side
LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal
data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic
data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local
devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based
LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high
response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used
personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.

TL;DR: 研究推荐系统中群体公平性和个体公平性的关系，发现群体高度公平的推荐对个体可能极不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作对群体公平性和个体公平性使用不同评估指标，无法比较二者关系，需填补该研究空白。

Method: 对可用于两种公平性类型的评估指标进行全面比较，在3个数据集上进行8次实验。

Result: 实验表明群体高度公平的推荐对个体可能极不公平。

Conclusion: 研究结果新颖且对推荐系统从业者改进系统公平性有用。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 代码和数据公开，便于后续研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing
foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for
advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study,
we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to
assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource,
multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of
19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains --
including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key
characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest
that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset
transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation
scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly
enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been
publicly released to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出Diff - MSIN框架用于点击率预测，含三个创新模块，经实验验证比基线显著提升至少1.67%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR预测方法多基于ID模态，无法全面建模用户多模态偏好，且现有多模态融合方法存在不足，需引入多模态CTR预测。

Method: 提出Diff - MSIN框架，包含MFE、SRC和FDAF三个模块，设计知识解耦方法。

Result: 在Rec - Tmall和三个亚马逊数据集上实验，比基线显著提升至少1.67%。

Conclusion: Diff - MSIN框架能有效提升多模态推荐系统性能。

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

Result: 系统能以高交付率和高语义准确性生成答案。

Conclusion: 开发的GeoQA系统有效，还开发网页应用提高其可访问性。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from
digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the
extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that
supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering
(QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query
languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this
project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge
graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of
the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of
GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map
images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to
provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate
that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high
semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web
application that supports interactive querying and visualization.

Conclusion: NewsReX让复杂实验复现更快且适用更多硬件，对训练参数的分析可为未来研究提供参考。

Abstract: Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become
increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse
codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models.
We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this
process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and
JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show
that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader
research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on
custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese
news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned
for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news.
NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a
wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less
powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers
an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature,
including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying
number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary
analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce
redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices. Code

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Motivation: 现有可检索性分数分布衡量检索模型曝光偏差可能不准确，未考虑主题相关性差异。

Result: 用T - Retrievability度量分析揭示了各种神经排序模型的曝光特征。

Conclusion: 局部度量能更细致理解曝光公平性，为评估信息检索系统中文档可访问性提供更可靠方法。

Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures
its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank
cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across
documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability
scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in
our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the
exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution
of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately
reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a
solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we
call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes
retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and
then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level
statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers
new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking
models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more
nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach
for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长后点击行为序列带来高计算成本和效率问题，传统方法利用序列上下文不完整；多模态嵌入融入大型推荐模型有挑战。

Method: 引入DMGIN，用Multimodal LLMs分组重组长后点击行为序列，通过兴趣统计、组内和组间transformers减少信息损失。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集实验确认DMGIN有效且高效，LBS广告系统A/B测试显示CTR提升4.7%，Revenue per Mile提升2.3%。

Conclusion: DMGIN能有效提升模型效率和准确性，可用于提升CTR预测。

Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial
for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click
behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume
of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training
and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage
approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete
utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating
multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents
significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens
and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the
model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest
Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences
contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,
DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete
lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no
additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing
multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from
grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors
within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers
to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally
ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that
DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Conclusion: RL在医疗AI中具有变革性作用，可作为代理临床智能而非单纯预测工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效，LSTM - GRU模型在EEG情绪分类中性能优越。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Conclusion: PVPO方法有效，能解决现有方法问题，在多任务和不同规模模型上表现良好。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

Conclusion: Gen - LRA是合成数据发布的有效隐私审计工具，凸显了生成模型过拟合在现实应用中的重大隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Conclusion: AdaGram有潜力成为大模型自适应优化的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Conclusion: 所采用的多种技术结合构建的数据工作流可用于DSN异常检测和后续维护运营。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

Result: 在高概率意义下建立了随机梯度下降/流在训练过参数化两层PINNs时的线性收敛性，扩展了现有结果。

Conclusion: 分析为优化过程的动态提供了见解，为随机算法训练的神经网络提供了保证。

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Method: 将大语言模型路由作为上下文多臂老虎机问题，开发查询和大语言模型的共享嵌入空间，提出PILOT方法，引入在线成本策略。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs在时间序列任务上有优势，能解决传统ESNs长期信息处理难题。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Motivation: 以新视角（约束变分原理）为大语言模型解码步骤提供简洁、自洽的解释。

Method: 将解码步骤视为概率单纯形上的约束变分原理，利用离散的乘法权重更新及其连续时间极限的复制器流进行分析。

Result: 证明固定上下文和温度时，下一令牌分布在单纯形内沿平滑轨迹收敛到softmax平衡态；温度是时间的精确重新缩放，top - k和核采样将流限制在面上有相同保证；给出路径依赖分数调整的解释及与幻觉行为联系。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型解码步骤提供了理论分析，有实际应用价值，但训练动态和内部表示留待未来研究。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Result: 标准RL训练在各设置下始终稳健，许多反直觉结果在模型和任务强对齐时出现，在更具挑战性场景中无法推动显著学习。

Conclusion: 模型和任务的强对齐是导致RL应用于LLM时出现反直觉现象的关键因素。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Result: 在标准类增量基准测试中，与最先进的基于内存的方法竞争，优于无内存方法，在CIFAR - 10和CIFAR - 100上分别比最佳单类增量性能提高近10%和7%。

Conclusion: 该方法是可扩展、无任务标签且内存高效的持续学习解决方案，还便于学习过程可视化，可作为生成模型使用。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Result: 技术上可大幅减少推理数据且无显著性能损失，其实用性受技术设置和用户特征两因素决定。

Conclusion: 数据最小化技术可行，但实际操作有挑战，难以制定通用的数据“必要性”标准。

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Result: MoE模型显著降低L - 2预测误差，优于集成平均和最准确的单个专家模型。

Conclusion: MoE框架是结合专业架构优势创建更强大准确复合代用模型的有效策略。

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Motivation: 现有激活修补方法计算开销大，归因修补在深度非线性网络中存在噪声和可靠性问题，需更优方法。

Result: RelP比标准归因修补更准确近似激活修补，在IOI任务中效果显著，如GPT - 2 Large的MLP输出，归因修补皮尔逊相关系数0.006，RelP达0.956；RelP与IG忠实度相当但无额外计算开销。

Conclusion: RelP在保持计算效率的同时提高了忠实度，是一种有效的方法。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

Motivation: 准确估计每个客户端在联邦学习中的贡献对公平奖励和选择有用客户端很重要，但精确计算Shapley值不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略。

Result: 在固定估值成本下，在相同通信轮数内，FedOwen在非IID基准上比现有基线最终准确率高23%。

Conclusion: FedOwen框架能有效近似Shapley值，通过自适应策略减少偏差，提高模型准确率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型评估注重最终准确率，忽略适应成本，本文旨在衡量模型冷启动适应性。

Method: 定义G&L方法，通过测量模型顺序标记未标记数据集时的总错误来衡量冷启动适应性，定义四个轨道，形式化协议并关联经典错误界理论，估计启发式“神谕参考带”。

Result: 在MNIST和AG News上实验，发现不同模型早期效率有系统差异，当前模型远高于神谕带，存在适应性差距。

Conclusion: G&L方法量化早期学习的错误成本，补充传统基准，为开发从最初样本就可靠的学习器提供可复现框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出MyGO终身学习框架，借鉴生物的清醒 - 睡眠周期，免存原始数据，在CV和NLP基准测试中效果好，能减轻灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在数据隐私、存储限制和任务差异大时性能下降方面存在挑战，需要新方法解决。

Method: 引入MyGO框架，在“清醒”阶段学习新任务并训练生成模型，“睡眠”阶段用生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏整合新旧知识。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，与顺序微调基线相比，MyGO显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，且跨任务平均准确率高。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效且具有领域通用性。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成敏感信息问题，克服FILA方法需访问全量参数、未考虑Fisher信息假设等局限。

Method: 提出VILA框架，明确考虑FILA忽略的假设，不访问全量模型实现参数识别。

Result: 比FILA参数效率高100倍、训练速度快40倍，在多个基准测试达SOTA。

Conclusion: VILA框架有效解决问题，有更好的效率和性能，代码开源。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kyj93790/VILA.

Motivation: 理解常用Q学习强化学习算法在实践中的收敛性。

Method: 研究最简单形式的Q学习算法RASQL，分析其在温和技术条件下的收敛性，也对学习周期性策略的变体进行分析。

Result: RASQL在温和技术条件下收敛到适当定义的正则化MDP的不动点，类似分析对其变体也适用，数值示例表明经验收敛行为与理论极限相符。

Conclusion: 所提出的分析框架有效，能解释常用Q学习算法的收敛性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

TL;DR: 提出Sampled - SAE改进TopK SAE和BatchTopK，通过不同l值在全局一致性和细粒度重建间权衡，最佳l值依不同指标权衡而定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TopK SAE效率低，BatchTopK存在‘激活抽奖’问题，需要改进稀疏自编码器。

Method: 对批量激活矩阵的列打分形成候选池，再用Top - K从受限特征池选特征，通过改变l值在批量级和特定标记选择间调节。

Result: 在Pythia - 160M上，没有单一l值能在所有指标上达到最优。

Conclusion: Sampled - SAE将BatchTopK重构为可调、感知分布的家族。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的实验验证了Stage - Diff在长期时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage - Diff能有效应对长期时间序列生成中的挑战，平衡多种依赖关系。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Conclusion: DLGAN模型是一种简单而有效的生成模型，能解决现有时间序列合成方法的问题。

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: AHTSGD能加速从不良初始化开始的早期训练，提高在干净和噪声环境下的泛化能力，对学习率选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual

extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and

class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different

previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: CoM能有效缓解因协变量偏移导致的性能下降，产生连贯的合并模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

Conclusion: 所提算法能让策略同时受益于集合平均和时间平均，可有效提升强化学习在个体轨迹上的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML

Conclusion: CByG框架对实际药物发现应用有效且实用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数早退出方法依赖基于置信度的退出策略，部分工作校准中间分类器提升整体模型性能，但校准措施可能存在问题。

Method: 分析校准措施的局限性，通过实证案例展示未校准网络可能优于校准网络，提出使用失败预测作为替代方法。

Result: 发现校准措施可能误导性能评估，未校准网络在某些情况下表现更好，失败预测与效率提升有强相关性。

Conclusion: 失败预测考虑样本排名变化，是设计和评估早退出模型更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

TL;DR: 提出Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN - DT)，结合序列建模与神经形态效率，在经典控制基准测试中表现好且能耗低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的强化学习代理不适用于能量受限的边缘平台，此前工作未将脉冲动态与回报条件序列建模无缝结合。

Method: 将Leaky Integrate - Fire神经元嵌入每个自注意力块，通过替代梯度进行端到端训练，融入三因素可塑性、相移基于脉冲的位置编码和轻量级树突路由模块。

Result: 在经典控制基准测试中达到或超过标准Decision Transformer性能，每次决策发射少于十个脉冲，每推理能耗降低超四个数量级。

Conclusion: SNN - DT为嵌入式和可穿戴设备的实时低功耗控制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险决策任务中应用广泛，但处理表格数据、确保公平性和提供可靠预测存在困难，需评估其在贷款审批任务中的表现。

Method: 评估大语言模型在加纳、德国和美国三个地区序列化贷款审批数据集上的零样本和上下文学习能力。

Result: 序列化格式显著影响大语言模型的性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT有更高F1分数但加剧公平差距；上下文学习相对零样本基线提升性能4.9 - 59.6%，对公平性影响因数据集而异。

Conclusion: 有效表格数据表示方法和公平感知模型对提高大语言模型在金融决策中的可靠性很重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Result: 通过不同SAT基准测试验证了曲率是问题复杂度的强指标，可用于预测性能。

Conclusion: 将研究结果与现有求解器设计原则相联系，并给出未来研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动方法中数据稀缺和物理一致性的关键挑战，评估PINNs作为智能电网动力学替代模型的能力。

Method: 通过三个关键实验（插值、交叉验证和情景轨迹预测），将PINNs与XGBoost、随机森林和线性回归对比，仅通过基于物理的损失函数训练PINNs。

Result: PINNs在泛化能力上表现出色，在误差降低方面优于数据驱动模型，在动态电网运行中MAE较低，能可靠捕捉状态转换，虽在极端运行状态有轻微性能下降，但能始终保证物理可行性。

Conclusion: PINNs可作为智能电网替代的范式转换工具，有助于实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生，强调了关键能源系统中物理感知架构的必要性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot

structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine

machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe

specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement

600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature

Result: 在各种标准OOD基准测试中取得最优结果。

Conclusion: 提出的ActSub方法在OOD检测中有效，不同分布偏移下应区别处理激活成分。

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 不连续性预测为估计潜在未来或假设事件对特定社区的特殊影响带来新可能。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Conclusion: SNL具多功能性，为多领域研究者和学者带来新机会。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in

Motivation: 现有多标签排序框架未利用正标签间排序信息，且存在数据集稀缺和标注偏差问题。

Method: 提出UniMLR范式，用正标签间排序将隐式类相关性建模为概率分布；引入八个合成数据集。

Conclusion: 所提框架有价值。

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决心率预测中的数据异质性问题，有较好性能和实用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗系统多模态数据用于临床预测有挑战，现有方法要求完整模态数据或手动选择策略，适用性受限。

Method: 提出MoE - Health框架，利用专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合专家。

Result: 在MIMIC - IV数据集三个临床预测任务上，MoE - Health比现有多模态融合方法性能更优，且在不同模态可用性模式下保持稳健。

Conclusion: MoE - Health能有效整合多模态信息，提升预测性能和处理异构不完整医疗数据的稳健性，适合多样医疗环境。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: 本文提出QR - LoRA方法，通过QR分解提取正交基表达LoRA更新，实验表明其用极少参数就能匹配或超越全微调、标准LoRA和SVD - LoRA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模增长促使开发参数高效微调技术，现有SVD初始化的LoRA变种存在计算昂贵和向量难解释问题。

Method: 利用带列主元的QR分解从预训练权重矩阵中提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务实验中，QR - LoRA用601个参数就能匹配或超越全微调、标准LoRA和SVD - LoRA的性能，参数相比全微调减少超1000倍，比典型LoRA设置少77倍。

Conclusion: QR - LoRA是一种高效的参数微调技术，能以极少参数达到良好性能。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

Motivation: 隐私法规和AI责任框架使真实数据使用受限，需解决表格数据隐私和公平性问题。

Method: 提出基于变压器的变分自编码器FLIP，训练用Rényi差分隐私约束，输入空间用RDP兼容平衡采样，潜在空间用CKA对齐受保护组神经元激活模式。

Result: FLIP在差分隐私约束下，有效提升任务无关公平性和不同下游任务公平性。

Conclusion: FLIP是生成异构表格数据的有效方法，能在隐私约束下提升公平性。

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Motivation: 聚焦量子和混合量子 - 经典软件系统，利用模型驱动方法降低因平台异构和开发者技能不足带来的成本和风险。

Method: 使用RAG管道，结合公共GitHub仓库中的Qiskit代码样本，利用精心设计的提示从UML模型实例生成Python代码。

Result: 精心设计的提示可将CodeBLEU分数提高四倍，生成更准确一致的量子代码。

Conclusion: 当前实验验证了部分想法，未来可进一步研究，如将软件系统模型实例作为RAG管道的信息源，或使用大语言模型进行代码到代码的转换。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出UTRL框架训练大模型生成高质量单元测试，实验表明其效果优于有监督微调及前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练大模型生成高质量单元测试的方法探索不足，需新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出UTRL强化学习框架，通过强化学习以对抗方式迭代训练单元测试生成器和代码生成器两个大模型。

Result: UTRL训练的Qwen3 - 4B生成的单元测试质量高于有监督微调，且在生成高质量单元测试上优于GPT - 4.1。

Conclusion: UTRL在训练大模型生成高质量单元测试任务中有效。

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

Result: 在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集测试，短名单质量高，近期快照准确率大幅上升。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型可替代昂贵的特征工程和基于图的方法。

Abstract: Bug triaging, the task of assigning new issues to developers, is often slow
and inconsistent in large projects. We present a lightweight framework that
instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses
candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on
EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality
(Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent
snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for
real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that
instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature
engineering and graph-based methods.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的软件工程项目代理使用LLM摘要处理上下文历史问题，但不清楚相比直接省略旧观察，增加的复杂性是否带来实际性能提升。

Method: 在SWE - bench Verified上对SWE - agent中的不同策略进行系统比较，涵盖五种不同模型配置。

Result: 简单观察掩码策略使成本减半，求解率与LLM摘要相当，有时略高，如Qwen3 - Coder 480B中求解率从53.8%提升到54.8%。

Conclusion: 至少在SWE - agent on SWE - bench Verified中，最简单的上下文管理方式可能是最有效和高效的。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 提出LMPA愿景并讨论实现的关键挑战。

Abstract: Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing
frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major
limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,
resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge
this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a
vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and
scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs
and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context
propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring
initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with
natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing
this vision.

Result: 评估了难度得分有效性，以及方法有效性和成本与策略数量的关系，考察了促进多样性方法对状态空间的覆盖和触发故障行为情况。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示MPTCS在解决强化学习策略测试问题上有一定潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential
decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of
the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most
reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to
the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is
unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel
automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract
test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their
solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to
select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal
typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases
from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,
based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty
score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of
policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test
suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by
quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state
space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.

Abstract: As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written
programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.
In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human
developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and
Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security
vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code
samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via
Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common
Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and
more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,
while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher
concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also
contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the
distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need
for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.

Abstract: In this paper we consider how we can include index options in enhanced
indexation. We present the concept of an \enquote{option strategy} which
enables us to treat options as an artificial asset. An option strategy for a
known set of options is a specified set of rules which detail how these options
are to be traded (i.e.~bought, rolled over, sold) depending upon market
conditions.
  We consider option strategies in the context of enhanced indexation, but we
discuss how they have much wider applicability in terms of portfolio
optimisation.
  We use an enhanced indexation approach based on second-order stochastic
dominance. We consider index options for the S\&P~500, using a dataset of daily
stock prices over the period 2017-2025 that has been manually adjusted to
account for survivorship bias. This dataset is made publicly available for use
by future researchers.
  Our computational results indicate that introducing option strategies in an
enhanced indexation setting offers clear benefits in terms of improved
out-of-sample performance. This applies whether we use equities or an
exchange-traded fund as part of the enhanced indexation portfolio.

Abstract: Digital payments play a pivotal role in the burgeoning digital economy.
Moving forward, the enhancement of digital payment systems necessitates
programmability, going beyond just efficiency and convenience, to meet the
evolving needs and complexities. Smart contract platforms like Central Bank
Digital Currency (CBDC) networks and blockchains support programmable digital
payments. However, the prevailing paradigm of programming payment logics
involves coding smart contracts with programming languages, leading to high
costs and significant security challenges. A novel and versatile method for
payment programming on DLTs was presented in this paper - transforming digital
currencies into token streams, then pipelining smart contracts to authorize,
aggregate, lock, direct, and dispatch these streams efficiently from source to
target accounts. By utilizing a small set of configurable templates, a few
specialized smart contracts could be generated, and support most of payment
logics through configuring and composing them. This approach could
substantially reduce the cost of payment programming and enhance security,
self-enforcement, adaptability, and controllability, thus hold the potential to
become an essential component in the infrastructure of digital economy.

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

*Peiqi Zhao,Carlos E. Rodríguez,Ramsés H. Mena,Stephen G. Walker*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出基于随机加权支持点的生成建模框架，可从固定数据集生成多样且可解释的样本集，在MNIST和CelebA - HQ数据集上验证其高效性和优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用支持点能紧凑且有信息地表示原始数据的特点，引入新的生成建模框架，避免概率建模假设和神经网络架构。

Method: 构建基于随机加权支持点的生成建模框架，用Dirichlet过程和贝叶斯自助法的加权方案引入随机性，基于CCP开发优化算法。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA - HQ数据集上，该方法能以较低计算成本产生高质量、多样的输出。

Conclusion: 随机加权支持点为生成建模提供了有原则、可扩展且可解释的替代方案，能生成保留数据结构的插值样本。

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于GMMNs的MMD中混合核的自适应带宽选择程序，证明其能提升学习能力，且AGMMNs在训练性能上优于GMMNs及典型参数copula模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进生成矩匹配网络（GMMNs）的学习效果，提升其在copula随机数生成器学习中的性能。

Method: 基于训练损失的相对误差在训练中增加核的数量，使用验证损失的相对误差作为早停准则。

Result: 自适应训练的AGMMNs训练时间与GMMNs相近，但训练性能显著提高，通过验证MMD轨迹、样本和验证MMD值评估。

Conclusion: AGMMNs在三个应用方面优于GMMNs和典型参数copula模型，且改进的训练能转化为更好的模型预测。

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

TL;DR: 文章对比多种CL和TL策略用于建筑热动力学建模，提出SML策略，在有无概念漂移场景下表现优于基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer Learning在有限数据下建模建筑热动力学有效，但后续利用新数据及应对建筑动态变化的研究不足，缺乏综合研究。

Method: 对比多种CL和TL策略及从头训练的模型，用中欧单户住宅5 - 7年模拟数据评估，提出Seasonal Memory Learning策略。

Result: SML策略比现有CL和TL方法精度提升大，无概念漂移时优于初始微调基准28.1%，有概念漂移时优于34.9%。

Conclusion: SML策略能以低计算量提高预测精度，有效应对概念漂移。

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

TL;DR: 提出DynaMark框架应对机床控制器重放攻击，可动态调整水印协方差，在数字孪生和物理测试台验证其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态水印方案因假设线性高斯动力学和使用恒定水印统计，难以应对机床控制器时变、部分专有行为，易受重放攻击。

Method: 将动态水印建模为马尔可夫决策过程，用强化学习在线学习自适应策略，动态调整零均值高斯水印协方差；开发贝叶斯信念更新机制用于实时检测置信度。

Result: 在西门子数字孪生上，水印能量降低70%，保持标称轨迹，检测延迟为一个采样间隔；物理测试台能快速触发警报，控制性能下降少。

Conclusion: DynaMark无需系统知识，能有效应对机床控制器重放攻击，优于现有基准。

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出Locus框架提高定向模糊测试效率，能提升现有模糊器发现漏洞的效率，还发现多个未修复漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向模糊测试方法存在不足，分支距离难以精确表征目标状态进展，手动指定约束难以泛化。

Method: 提出Locus框架，合成谓词捕捉模糊测试进展作为中间状态，利用程序分析工具合成和迭代优化候选谓词，通过符号执行防止误判。

Result: Locus显著提升了八个先进模糊器发现真实漏洞的效率，平均加速41.6倍，还发现了八个未修复漏洞，一个已获草案补丁。

Conclusion: Locus框架能够有效提高定向模糊测试的效率。

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target
program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,
confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential
vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are
often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by
numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches
rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;
however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize
progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified
constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to
generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed
fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing
progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones
towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under
fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while
providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to
diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis
tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while
ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false
rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus
substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in
discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.
So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already
acknowledged with a draft patch.

Motivation: 探究欧盟网络安全立法中风险的构建方式、各法案间风险概念的一致性以及描述风险法律概念的用词。

Method: 基于定性法律解释和分类构建的方法。

Result: 五项法案涵盖多种网络安全风险，许多法案用技术方面和资产构建法律风险概念，有一法案有威胁中心观点，存在可接受风险、非概率风险和残余风险方面的明显差距。

Conclusion: 欧盟新网络安全立法扩展了基于风险的监管方法，但增加了复杂性和合规负担，文末给出应对合规的实用建议。

Abstract: The European Union (EU) has long favored a risk-based approach to regulation.
Such an approach is also used in recent cyber security legislation enacted in
the EU. Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new
legislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's
five core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate
convergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what
qualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks.
Method : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation
and taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of
different cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to
technical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating
from man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the
legal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint
is also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable
risks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new
cyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach
to regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have
increased. With this point in mind, the paper concludes with a few practical
takeaways about means to deal with compliance and research it.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years,
revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily
rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a
complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in
dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research
predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within
the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we
conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their
third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored
activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage
third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party
dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python
ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM
ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer
than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include
vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the
understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners,
and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM
supply chain.

Conclusion: RepoMark是增强代码大语言模型训练透明度、保障仓库所有者权利的可靠且有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented
efficiency.
  However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g.,
from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding
data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are
increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper
authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack
of transparency in data collection.
  To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark
to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to
verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic
preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR)
guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants,
RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection,
RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization
within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark
significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when
the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files.
  Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over
90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This
represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all
of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This
further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising
solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard
the rights of repository owners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言到代码生成的深度学习模型依赖大量数据易受投毒攻击，且无触发的攻击难检测，需研究现有检测方法有效性。

Method: 对CodeBERT、CodeT5+、AST - T5三个模型进行针对性投毒，评估光谱特征分析、激活聚类和静态分析作为防御手段。

Result: 所有方法都难以检测无触发投毒，基于表示的方法无法分离投毒样本，静态分析有误报和漏报。

Conclusion: 需要为人工智能辅助代码生成开发更鲁棒、不依赖触发的防御方法。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models for natural language-to-code generation have become
integral to modern software development pipelines. However, their heavy
reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online
sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject
malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks
silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable
implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack,
making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from
poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of
existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model.
Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT,
CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation
clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods
struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches
failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false
positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust,
trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.

Conclusion: zkLoRA结合参数高效微调和零知识证明，填补了关键空白，可实现大语言模型在敏感或不可信环境中的安全可靠部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to
specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns
about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although
parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly
reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of
fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.
To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA
fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and
correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup
arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.
The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,
backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while
safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging
GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency
through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to
13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs,
zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of
LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning
models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious
party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute
model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are
continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised,
making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field.
This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for
designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the
largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those
attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive
threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse
attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been
studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack
development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list
of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks.
Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence
establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing
attacks.

Conclusion: OptMark方法有效解决了现有扩散水印方法的问题，是一种更好的扩散生成图像水印方案。

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection
and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face
significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for
large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to
certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of
comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an
optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the
intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically
inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail
watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization
terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the
challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising
steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,
reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that
OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust
resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,
editing, and regeneration attacks.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉引导的四足运动控制问题，强调结合本体感觉与视觉进行鲁棒控制的必要性。

Method: 提出QuadKAN，采用样条参数化跨模态策略，结合样条编码器和融合头，采用MMDR并通过PPO端到端训练。

Result: 在多种地形和场景评估中，QuadKAN比SOTA基线获得更高回报、更远距离和更少碰撞。

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒的视觉引导运动提供简单、有效且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人导航中映射目标后路径重叠导致死锁的问题。

Method: 将感兴趣空间离散为K个单元，施加K×K成本结构，基于最优传输理论得到最优且不重叠的单元转移；借助重规划和模型预测控制将时间结构整合到最优传输中。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决多机器人导航路径规划与调度问题，可应对路径重叠和机器人动力学问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽可用于机器人操作，但因现实任务多样和用户指令复杂，可靠的策略代码生成仍是挑战，不同用户指令会导致策略代码不可靠。

Method: 设计RoboInspector从操作任务复杂度和指令粒度两个角度分析，在两个框架下进行168种不同组合实验，提出基于失败策略代码反馈的改进方法。

Conclusion: 研究为实际开发提供减少不可靠性的见解，所提改进方法能有效提升大语言模型驱动的机器人操作中策略代码生成的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Motivation: 受食品银行和医疗供应链等现实系统启发，研究随机补货的重复资源分配中公平与效率的权衡。

Method: 构建模型，引入Bang - Bang控制策略，给出上界并匹配下界。

Result: 得到近紧的可实现嫉妒 - 低效对刻画，策略低效有相变，证明权衡由供应驱动。

Conclusion: 嫉妒 - 低效权衡在动态补货设置中持续存在，受决策者可用容量影响，与固定供应情况有本质区别。

Abstract: We study the trade-off between envy and inefficiency in repeated resource
allocation settings with stochastic replenishments, motivated by real-world
systems such as food banks and medical supply chains. Specifically, we consider
a model in which a decision-maker faced with stochastic demand and resource
donations must trade off between an equitable and efficient allocation of
resources over an infinite horizon. The decision-maker has access to storage
with fixed capacity $M$, and incurs efficiency losses when storage is empty
(stockouts) or full (overflows). We provide a nearly tight (up to constant
factors) characterization of achievable envy-inefficiency pairs. Namely, we
introduce a class of Bang-Bang control policies whose inefficiency exhibits a
sharp phase transition, dropping from $\Theta(1/M)$ when $\Delta = 0$ to
$e^{-\Omega(\Delta M)}$ when $\Delta > 0$, where $\Delta$ is used to denote the
target envy of the policy. We complement this with matching lower bounds,
demonstrating that the trade-off is driven by supply, as opposed to demand
uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that envy-inefficiency trade-offs not only
persist in settings with dynamic replenishment, but are shaped by the
decision-maker's available capacity, and are therefore qualitatively different
compared to previously studied settings with fixed supply.

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效。

Abstract: This paper studies the distributed minimax optimization problem over
networks. To enhance convergence performance, we propose a distributed
optimistic gradient tracking method, termed DOGT, which solves a surrogate
function that captures the similarity between local objective functions to
approximate a centralized optimistic approach locally. Leveraging a
Lyapunov-based analysis, we prove that DOGT achieves linear convergence to the
optimal solution for strongly convex-strongly concave objective functions while
remaining robust to the heterogeneity among them. Moreover, by integrating an
accelerated consensus protocol, the accelerated DOGT (ADOGT) algorithm achieves
an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} \left( \kappa \log \left( \epsilon
^{-1} \right) \right)$ and communication complexity of $\mathcal{O} \left(
\kappa \log \left( \epsilon ^{-1} \right) /\sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right)$ for
a suboptimality level of $\epsilon>0$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number
of the objective function and $\rho_W$ is the spectrum gap of the network.
Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频修复方法存在需大量计算资源、难处理长缺失片段等问题，需新方法解决音频退化挑战。

Method: 引入WaveLLDM架构，将高效神经音频编解码器与潜扩散模型结合，在压缩潜空间处理音频。

Result: 在Voicebank+DEMAND测试集上能实现准确频谱重建，LSD分数低，但WB - PESQ和STOI分数显示感知质量和语音清晰度不如现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WaveLLDM架构虽有不足，但结合神经音频编解码器和潜扩散模型的灵活架构为未来发展奠定基础。

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

Result: 在AST和AuM上应用，在AudioSet - 18k上mAP最多提升6.76，在SpeechCommandsV2上准确率最多提升8.46，计算量最多降低83.26%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能在音频分类中实现性能和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

Motivation: 现有MOS预测的池化方法多为单一粒度，可能忽略互补感知信息，需改进。

Method: 引入DRASP框架，整合粗粒度全局统计摘要和细粒度显著片段的注意力分析。

Result: 在不同数据集、MOS预测骨干和音频生成系统上，相比平均池化方法，系统级Spearman等级相关系数相对提升10.39%。

Conclusion: DRASP框架有效且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对通用机器学习原子间势（uMLIPs）预测裂解能的系统评估，而裂解能是关键属性。

Method: 使用包含36,718个板结构的DFT数据库对19种先进uMLIPs进行裂解能预测的全面基准测试，评估不同架构范式。

Result: 基于强调非平衡配置的OMat24数据集训练的模型表现最佳，平衡数据集训练的模型误差高5倍，表面吸附数据训练的模型误差高17倍，简单架构在合适数据上可实现与复杂模型相当的精度且有计算速度优势。

Conclusion: 研究界应专注于能捕捉相关物理现象的战略训练数据生成。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

Method: 引入Safe - Control，利用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，可构建并合并多种安全补丁。

Result: 在六个不同T2I模型上评估，Safe - Control有效减少不安全内容生成，保持良性图像质量和文本对齐，显著优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: Safe - Control能有效减少T2I模型中不安全内容生成，有良好适应性和性能。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Conclusion: R - 4B能根据问题复杂度自适应决定是否思考，有效解决现有模型在简单问题上的低效问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental

for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

TL;DR: 提出RadGS - Reg框架用于椎体级CT/X射线配准，在内部数据集实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT/X射线配准方法存在空间信息丢失、域差距问题，双平面X射线3D重建方法有密集视图要求且难以处理噪声X射线。

Method: 引入RadGS - Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体RadGS重建模块（采用基于学习的RadGS重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制），以及患者特定预训练策略。

Result: 在内部数据集上实验表明，在两项任务中达到了最先进的性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的RadGS - Reg框架有效，可用于椎体级CT/X射线配准。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

TL;DR: 提出视觉上下文提示框架VICP，使模型从已知类别泛化到未知类别，无需参数调整，在ShopID10K和其他基准上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标重识别方法缺乏泛化性且需要大量标注数据，自监督学习难以捕捉关键特征。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型，大语言模型通过任务提示推断语义身份规则，引导视觉基础模型提取特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K和多样重识别基准实验中，VICP在未知类别上明显优于基线。

Conclusion: VICP框架有效，能实现跨类别泛化，无需针对特定数据集重新训练。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Conclusion: 结合CNN特征提取与集成分类器是实现自动牙科诊断支持的可行途径，需更大数据集和进一步临床验证。

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

Result: 通过WSI目录、机器学习和基于图的WSI表示等具体实例说明所提标准的优势和适用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的通用框架和标准具有优势和适用性，能解决WSI元数据缺乏标准的问题。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

Result: 尽管模型尺寸小于基于扩散的方法，但MedShift性能强，推理时灵活，可调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift是医学成像领域适应的可扩展和可泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有视频幻觉基准主要针对短视频，对幻觉原因简化，SAH在长视频中因语义复杂尤为关键，需深入研究。

Method: 引入ELV - Halluc基准研究SAH，通过实验分析，采用位置编码策略和DPO策略，构建8K对抗数据对。

Result: 证实SAH存在且随语义复杂度增加，模型在语义快速变化时更易产生SAH，在ELV - Halluc和Video - MME上有改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: ELV - Halluc基准有助于研究长视频SAH，位置编码和DPO策略可缓解SAH。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 提出生成式公式学习以单张输入图像为条件的高斯点云3D表示分布，用变分自重建器从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间并训练扩散模型。

Result: 能生成逼真重建和多样样本，完成遮挡表面重建用于高质量360度渲染。

Conclusion: 所提方法可从单张图像实现完整3D场景重建，包括遮挡部分。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 现有成对比较标注任务中，穷举法标注量大，虽有工作降低标注负担但仍有提升空间。

Method: 使用CLIP模型对项目进行无训练的分层预排序，用自动化比较替代简单明显的人工比较；EZ - Sort先进行CLIP零样本预排序，初始化桶感知Elo分数，最后运行不确定性引导的人在环MergeSort。

Result: 在多个数据集验证，与穷举法相比降低90.5%人力标注成本，与先前工作相比降低19.8%（n = 100时），且提升或维持了评分者间信度。

Conclusion: 结合基于CLIP的先验知识和不确定性感知采样，能为成对排序提供高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Motivation: 当前DG评估对CLIP而言可能不够有挑战性，也无法充分测试真正未见数据场景，需要更好评估CLIP在野外DG性能。

Method: 一是在ImageNet上微调CLIP后在33个不同数据集上评估并量化OOD分数；二是使用遗忘学习让CLIP‘忘记’一些领域；提出CLIP - DCA方法，通过单独的领域头和合成的多样化领域数据增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知，同时通过与领域特征解耦鼓励领域不变分类。

Result: CLIP在更多OOD数据集上性能显著下降；CLIP - DCA在具有挑战性的评估中相比现有方法有显著改进，尤其在更多OOD数据集上。

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型进行有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP - DCA能提升CLIP在DG上的性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation

While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Motivation: 减少胸部X光片肺部疾病严重程度分类在类别不平衡情况下所需的标记数据量。

Method: 采用深度主动学习，用带蒙特卡罗Dropout的深度神经网络，使用多种获取函数从无标签池迭代选择最具信息的样本，用准确率、AU ROC、AU PRC评估性能，进行统计分析。

Result: 熵采样在二分类中用15.4%训练数据达93.7%准确率（AU ROC 0.91），Mean STD采样在多分类中用23.1%标记数据达70.3%准确率（AU ROC 0.86），优于复杂且计算成本高的获取函数。

Conclusion: 深度主动学习结合BNN近似和加权损失函数能有效减少标记数据需求，解决类别不平衡问题，维持或超越诊断性能。

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比信号（如耳心电图）中效果变差，需新方法。

Method: 用强化学习智能体设计一系列滤波器代替传统单个匹配滤波器，将滤波器设计作为顺序决策过程。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的真实世界心电图数据集上实现了最先进的R波峰检测和生理状态分类性能。

Conclusion: SMF框架有潜力用于可靠且可解释的临床决策支持，其公式可扩展到需要从噪声信号中准确定位模式的广泛应用。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Method: 用g - 方法分析有信息的顺序治疗，将连续治疗决策间的等待时间视为时变混杂因素，结合合成例子说明。

Result: 未调整等待时间的g - 方法可能有偏差，展示了调整方法，建立离散和连续时间模型调整与识别的联系。

Conclusion: 考虑治疗决策时间对有效推断很重要，可用调整等待时间的g - 方法校正有信息的时间问题。

Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of
a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings,
treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.
Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of
subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue
and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this
work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated
with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential
treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the
waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as
a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how
g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how
adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in
between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification
with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide
implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our
concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid
inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods
that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.

Motivation: 解决A/B测试中因发散投放导致因果解释复杂的问题，为广告商提供更可靠的广告效果评估方法。

Method: 对比分析Lift测试和A/B测试，对3,204个Lift测试和181,890个A/B测试进行大规模测量。

Result: Lift测试无明显受众不平衡，A/B测试有明显不平衡，部分活动配置可减少A/B测试的发散投放。

Conclusion: 发散投放是A/B测试特有且有意的，虽不能完全消除，但可通过配置减少其影响，为A/B测试提供基于证据的指导。

Abstract: Many digital platforms offer advertisers experimentation tools like Meta's
Lift and A/B tests to optimize their ad campaigns. Lift tests compare outcomes
between users eligible to see ads versus users in a no-ad control group. In
contrast, A/B tests compare users exposed to alternative ad configurations,
absent any control group. The latter setup raises the prospect of divergent
delivery: ad delivery algorithms may target different ad variants to different
audience segments. This complicates causal interpretation because results may
reflect both ad content effectiveness and changes to audience composition. We
offer three key contributions. First, we make clear that divergent delivery is
specific to A/B tests and intentional, informing advertisers about ad
performance in practice. Second, we measure divergent delivery at scale,
considering 3,204 Lift tests and 181,890 A/B tests. Lift tests show no
meaningful audience imbalance, confirming their causal validity, while A/B
tests show clear imbalance, as expected. Third, we demonstrate that campaign
configuration choices can reduce divergent delivery in A/B tests, lessening
algorithmic influence on results. While no configuration guarantees eliminating
divergent delivery entirely, we offer evidence-based guidance for those seeking
more generalizable insights about ad content in A/B tests.

Conclusion: 企业会通过跨国重新分配生产来应对国内投入冲击，垂直对外直接投资是应对供给侧中断的战略举措，研究有助于理解投入市场波动下全球生产决策的微观基础。

Abstract: This paper examines how adverse supply-side shocks in domestic input markets
influence firms' vertical outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) decisions.
While the theoretical basis for cost-driven OFDI is well established, empirical
evidence on the causal mechanisms remains limited. We develop a framework in
which input cost shocks raise unit production costs, but firms undertake
vertical OFDI only when shocks are sufficiently severe or when baseline costs
are already high. Firm heterogeneity leads to a sorting pattern, whereby more
productive firms are more likely to invest abroad. To test this mechanism, we
exploit China's 2017 waste paper import ban as an exogenous shock and leverage
a distinctive feature of the paper product industry's supply chain. Using a
difference-in-differences strategy and firm-level data from 2000 to 2023, we
find that the policy shock increased the probability of vertical OFDI by
approximately 16% in the post-policy period relative to a control group. These
results provide robust evidence that firms respond to domestic input shocks by
reallocating production across borders, highlighting vertical OFDI as a
strategic response to supply-side disruptions. The findings contribute to
understanding the micro-foundations of global production decisions in the face
of input market volatility.

Conclusion: EconAgentic有助于学术理解和去中心化代币经济设计治理的实践改进。

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

Method: 利用2008 - 2020年德国面板研究数据和行政数据，重建家庭福利领取和收入历史，用开源微观模拟模型模拟家庭资格。

Result: 长期因素显著影响申领概率，如更长的福利领取历史增加概率，更高收入潜力和正向收入冲击降低概率。

Conclusion: 现有忽略长期因素的未领取行为模型可能存在误设。

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that many households eligible for
means-tested benefits do not claim them, a phenomenon known as non-take-up.
Empirical studies frequently conceptualise non-take-up as a rational decision,
occurring when the perceived net utility of claiming is negative.
Theoretically, long-term factors can substantially impact this decision.
Despite the potential relevance of longitudinal aspects, evidence on their
influence remains limited.
  This study addresses this gap by incorporating long-term factors in the
analysis of non-take-up behaviour relating to Unemployment Benefit II (UB II),
Germany's basic means-tested welfare programme. Using data from the German
Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) from 2008 to 2020, linked
with administrative data from Germany's Federal Employment Agency (PASS-ADIAB),
this study reconstructs households' benefit receipt and income histories, even
during non-survey periods. This allows modelling benefit non-take-up for
eligible households using the duration and frequency of past benefit receipt.
In addition, the use of administrative data mitigates bias from self-reported
benefit receipt. Household eligibility for UB II is simulated using GETTSIM, an
open-source microsimulation model, applied to the PASS dataset for the first
time.
  Findings indicate that long-term factors significantly influence the
probability of claiming UB II. Specifically, a longer history of benefit
receipt increases this probability, whereas higher income potential and
positive income shocks reduce it. Including long-term factors substantially
affects the estimated impact of traditionally used determinants of non-take-up,
indicating a potential misspecification in existing models that neglect them.

Abstract: Economic complexity - a group of dimensionality-reduction methods that apply
network science to trade data - represented a paradigm shift in development
economics towards materializing the once-intangible concept of capabilities as
inferrable and quantifiable. Measures such as the Economic Complexity Index
(ECI) and the Product Space have proven their worth as robust estimators of an
economy's subsequent growth; less obvious, however, is how they have come to be
so. Despite ECI drawing its micro-foundations from a combinatorial model of
capabilities, where a set of homogeneous capabilities combine to form products
and the economies which can produce them, such a model is consistent with
neither the fact that distinct product classes draw on distinct capabilities,
nor the interrelations between different products in the Product Space which so
much of economic complexity is based upon.
  In this paper, we extend the combinatorial model of economic complexity
through two innovations: an underlying network which governs the relatedness
between capabilities, and a production function which trades the original
binary specialization function for a fine-grained, product-level output
function. Using country-product trade data across 216 countries, 5000 products
and two decades, we show that this model is able to accurately replicate both
the characteristic topology of the Product Space and the complexity
distribution of countries' export baskets. In particular, the model bridges the
gap between the ECI and capabilities by transforming measures of economic
complexity into direct measures of the capabilities held by an economy - a
transformation shown to both improve the informativeness of the Economic
Complexity Index in predicting economic growth and enable an interpretation of
economic complexity as a proxy for productive structure in the form of
capability substitutability.

Motivation: 评估辽宁和内蒙古城乡蒙、满两个少数民族与汉族的收入差距。

Method: 采用简单一阶OLS线性回归、带交互项的线性回归和Blinder - Oaxaca分解三种统计方法。

Result: 农村地区蒙古族可能因歧视面临显著民族工资惩罚；城市三族收入差距主要可由公共部门职业参与或中共党员身份解释；农村蒙古族公共部门工作和党员身份回报更高。

Conclusion: 中国民族政策的积极行动能有效促进少数民族与汉族在劳动力市场结果上的融合，与先前研究一致。

Abstract: This study analyzes the 2018 Chinese Household Income Project survey data to
evaluate the income gaps between an "outsider" ethnic minority group, the
Mongols, an "insider" ethnic minority group, the Manchus, and the majority Han
group in urban and rural areas of Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia in
China. Three statistical methods, a simple first-order OLS linear regression,
linear regressions with interaction terms, and the Blinder-Oaxaca
Decomposition, are used to investigate the income disparity amongst the three
groups. The results indicate that Mongols suffer a significant ethnic wage
penalty attributable to possible discrimination in the rural areas of these two
provinces, while the urban income gaps between the three groups can mostly be
explained by participation in public sector occupations or affiliation with the
Chinese Communist Party. In rural settings, Mongols also have higher returns to
public sector jobs and CCP membership compared to the other two ethnic groups.
The findings suggest that Chinese affirmative actions regarding ethnic policy
are effective in accelerating the integration of ethnic minorities with Han in
the outcomes of the labor market. This conclusion is consistent with previous
studies.

<details>

Motivation: 随着健康系统建模对医疗生产描述更完善，需要建立对生产过程的稳健概念化描述。

Method: 以马拉维Thanzi La Onse模型为例，采用基于Leontief技术（固定投入比例）的生产方式。

Result: 将Leontief技术融入基于代理的全疾病模型后，其原本的限制性属性不再存在。

Conclusion: Leontief框架可成为描述医疗生产、研究卫生系统投资回报的丰富结构。

Abstract: As health system modeling (HSM) advances to include more complete
descriptions of the production of healthcare, it is important to establish a
robust conceptual characterisation of the production process. For the Thanzi La
Onse model in Malawi we have incorporated an approach to production that is
based on a form of Leontief technology -- fixed input proportions. At first
sight, this form of technology appears restrictive relative to the general
conception of a production function employed in economics. In particular, the
Leontief technology is associated with constant returns to scale, and level
sets that are piecewise linear, both of which are highly restrictive
properties. In this article we demonstrate that once incorporated into an all
disease, agent-based model these properties are no longer present and the
Leontief framework becomes a rich structure for describing healthcare
production, and hence for examining the returns to health systems investments.

TL;DR: 本文探索凸松弛层次在离散和连续优化问题近似中的算法应用与局限，含CSP、多项式、矩阵范数问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究凸松弛层次在近似离散和连续优化问题中的应用与局限。

Method: 分析线性规划松弛、平方和半定规划松弛，利用几何工具和嵌入定理证明。

Result: 给出CSP可近似性二分，多项式问题有近似比和运行时间权衡，证明矩阵范数近似的NP难结果和近似算法。

Conclusion: 这些结果都与几何有联系，几何在证明中起关键作用。

Abstract: This thesis explores algorithmic applications and limitations of convex
relaxation hierarchies for approximating some discrete and continuous
optimization problems.
  - We show a dichotomy of approximability of constraint satisfaction problems
(CSPs) by linear programming (LP) relaxations: for every CSP, the approximation
obtained by a basic LP relaxation, is no weaker than the approximation obtained
using relaxations given by super-constant levels of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy
on instances of size $n$.
  - For the problem of approximating the absolute maximum of an n-variate
degree-d homogeneous polynomial f with real coefficients over the unit sphere,
we analyze the optimum value of the level-t sum-of-squares (SoS) SDP relaxation
of the problem. Our results offer a trade-off between the approximation ratio
and running time, which can take advantage of additional structure in the
polynomial, such as non-negativity or sparsity of the coefficients.
  - We study the problem of approximating the $p \to q$-norm of a matrix $A$,
and prove the first NP-hardness result for approximating norms in the
hypercontractive case $1< p < q < \infty$. We also prove almost tight
algorithmic results for the case when $p \geq q$ (with $2 \in [q,p]$) where
constant factor approximations for the matrix norms are possible.
  A common theme for these results is their connection to geometry. For the
discrete optimization problem of CSP, geometry appears as a crucial tool for
our lower bound proof. For the problem of polynomial optimization, we show that
SDPs capture and extend earlier algorithms based on diameter estimation for
convex bodies. For the matrix (operator) norm problem, the definition itself is
geometric in nature and embedding theorems play a crucial role in our proofs.

TL;DR: 受神经元树突启发，提出高效轻量级SNN方法NSPDI - SNN，实验显示其能在高稀疏度下保持性能，表明树突结构和计算可用于开发高效SNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN神经元结构难以匹配生物神经元树突的复杂结构，为提升SNN性能。

Method: 提出NSPDI - SNN方法，引入非线性树突整合（NDI），构建非线性突触剪枝（NSP）方法。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和两个复杂任务上，NSPDI - SNN实现高稀疏度且性能损失小，在三个事件流数据集上取得最佳结果，还提高了突触信息传递效率。

Conclusion: 神经元树突的复杂结构和非线性计算为开发高效SNN方法提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on
simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent
artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons
have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,
the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.
Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal
dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with
nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we
introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation
of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state
transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible
nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We
conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,
CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks
(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).
Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal
performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best
experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis
showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information
transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a
promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

Result: 能将大语言模型生成的经济预测映射到特定概念并计算重要性，可引导模型改变风险偏好等，纠正或模拟偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法透明、轻量且可复制，适用于社会科学的实证研究。

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan"
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as
sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative
importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,
lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.

Motivation: 提升大语言模型从用户或外部源智能、自适应收集信息的能力，使其成为有效的多轮对话代理。

Method: 基于迭代选择使预期信息增益最大化的问题，使用从大语言模型信念分布导出的概率模型，还有如EIG估计器等创新。

Result: 在基于20个问题游戏和推断用户偏好的广泛测试中，BED - LLM性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: BED - LLM方法有效，能提升大语言模型信息收集能力，优于直接提示和其他自适应设计策略。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 大语言模型依赖网络数据，但网络爬取存在数据质量、安全和伦理问题，且此前对有害内容的研究因计算限制仅针对小样本，因此需要对训练数据集进行分析。

Method: 提出基于ElasticSearch的管道框架来索引和分析大语言模型训练数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples

pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2

TL;DR: 提出CounterBias Augmentation (CoBA)框架，通过处理语义三元组生成反偏数据，解决深度学习模型虚假关联问题，提升性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型依赖训练数据中的虚假关联，导致性能下降和泛化能力差，为解决这些问题开展研究。

Method: 提出CoBA统一框架，在语义三元组层面操作，将文本分解为三元组，选择性修改以破坏虚假关联，再重构文本生成反偏数据。

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅提高下游任务性能，还减少偏差，增强分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA是解决虚假关联挑战的通用且强大的方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Method: 在无标签、真实标签和两种虚假标签四种条件下，让ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude对各自生成的博客文章进行评估，采用整体偏好投票和质量评级。

Result: 发现'Claude'标签提升分数，'Gemini'标签降低分数，虚假标签常改变排名，且不同模型在真实标签下自评估表现不同。

Conclusion: 感知的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断和影响详细质量评级，需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保大语言模型基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST - 2基准上进行评估，证明了其对正字法噪声的恢复力和在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成式语言模型能解决自回归语言模型易受正字法攻击的问题，具有更强的鲁棒性和多语言兼容性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Result: 方法可实现最高3倍的提速，且不牺牲AUROC性能。

Conclusion: DMP与多种因素正交，能持续提高多响应生成效率，有望扩展到对齐和推理任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过常态概念重新理解图灵测试，探讨其本质和相关影响。

Method: 从统计意义上的常态角度分析图灵测试，包括测试目标和评判方式。

Result: 图灵测试是对正常智能的测试，大语言模型如ChatGPT难通过该测试。

Conclusion: 一是大语言模型是人工聪明而非人工智能；二是图灵测试对理解人类认知的核心问题在于人类思维是否可归结为正常/平均思维。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Conclusion: 倡导采用更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Conclusion: Med - RewardBench可用于评估医学奖励模型和评判器，微调能提升基线模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as
healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies
incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the
specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

Motivation: 现有提升数据质量的方法在静态数据集整理上存在局限，无法适应模型能力的不断发展。

Method: 引入Middo框架，包含自引用诊断模块识别次优样本，自适应优化引擎将其转化为有价值训练点，优化过程随模型能力动态进化。

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同进化，为大语言模型的可持续训练建立了新范式。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model

Motivation: AI研究和实践中，RiR任务有特殊需求，现有标准语言回归任务方法不适用，需探索适合RiR的方法。

Method: 构建三个现实问题作为RiR任务基准，测试基线方法不足，提出结合批量反思提示优化和神经集成学习的MENTAT方法。

Result: MENTAT比两个基线方法提升达65%。

Conclusion: MENTAT有效果，但RiR领域仍有很大进步空间。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Method: 提出Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR)方法，用推理和最终答案的联合对数似然对候选生成进行评分。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著提升，如MATH500提升10.18，AIME2025提升9.81，多数对比中用更少样本超越基线。

Conclusion: 正确推理链有更高推理和答案置信度，证明PiCSAR有效。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Motivation: 现有ASR系统处理儿童语音困难，自监督学习虽提升成人语音转录效果，但儿童语音转录仍是挑战，需提升儿童语音ASR性能。

Method: 分析Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、Data2Vec和WavLM等模型分层特征，将其集成到基于Kaldi工具包的简化DNN - ASR系统，以WSJCAM0成人语音训练，PFSTAR儿童语音测试。

Result: Wav2Vec2模型第22层字错率最低为5.15%，相对直接零样本解码提升51.64%；年龄组分析显示性能随年龄增长提升，低龄组也有显著提升；CMU Kids数据集实验有相似趋势。

Conclusion: 所提利用自监督学习预训练模型分层特征的方法能有效提升儿童语音ASR性能，且具泛化性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 自监督特征对提升儿童语音零样本关键词检测性能有显著贡献，能解决儿童语音特性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of
vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm,
does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs
such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i
v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct.
Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$
such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 =
O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of
$O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM
J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs
$x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i
x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the
constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also
yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in
the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, our result settles both conjectures when $d \geq
\log^2n$. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together
with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral
orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of
the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the
linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector,
alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration
inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.

TL;DR: 本文提出Catwalk神经元实现方法，利用输入稀疏性优化RNL神经元，提升面积和功率效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMOS神经元实现未充分利用输入稀疏性，为提升硬件效率开展研究。

Method: 通过一元top - k将脉冲 volley 中的脉冲重新定位为排序子集簇，减少后续并行计数器成本。

Result: 布局布线结果显示，Catwalk在面积和功率方面分别比现有SRM0 - RNL神经元好1.39倍和1.86倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的Catwalk神经元实现可有效提升RNL神经元的面积和功率效率。

Abstract: Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize
bit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ
neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input
spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs.
Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model
(SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs
can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the
dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of
sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper,
we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike
volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can
significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for
accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to
improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation.
Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and
power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.

Conclusion: 提出的BWMA方法能有效提高CNN在CIM加速器上的精度，4位激活量化是较优选择。

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.

Result: 基于CRPS的轨迹学习产生的参数化方案准确且尖锐，易于校准，在短期预报中优于基于导数拟合的参数化方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在短期预报中表现良好，对数据同化应用特别有前景。

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble
forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss
function. Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and
train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate
ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning
produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting
parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform
derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts. This
approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to
its accuracy over short lead times.

Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale
networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With
machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations
-- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the
network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a
population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood,
work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these
embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings
alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed
worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings
with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However,
after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and
orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with
the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed
differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between
different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes
methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can
be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network
differences in education to right-wing populist voting.

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

Result: 稀疏回归在应对挑战上总体优于符号回归，深度学习和大语言模型可实现创新先验知识整合，但可靠性和一致性待提高。

Conclusion: 学习数字孪生的进展将来自混合模块化框架，还需基准测试框架评估方法。

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

Motivation: 传统抗体发现流程耗时长，难以应对病毒快速爆发，需要加速抗体发现。

Method: 引入ImmunoAI框架，用梯度提升模型基于多种描述符预测高亲和力候选抗体，训练LightGBM回归器，用AlphaFold2预测无实验结构的病毒变体3D结构。

Result: 模型缩小抗体候选搜索空间89%，微调后降低RMSE，找到针对hMPV A2.2变体关键突变位点的两个高亲和力抗体候选。

Conclusion: ImmunoAI缩短设计周期，能更快基于结构应对病毒爆发。

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

Conclusion: MicroLabVR 能改善用户对微生物组数据的空间情境探索，提升数据分析能力。

Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food
digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood
in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease.
Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more
research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing
spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial
communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited
functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results.
To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively
explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers
spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance
user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing
population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux
distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to
evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to
improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome
data in their spatial context.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Conclusion: 肽特异性片段离子概率预测很重要，且肽 - 片段关系需要复杂机器学习方法来处理。

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such
as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum
linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary
sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework
that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead,
amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block
encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions.
Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization,
which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve
nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve
superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods
on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth
and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations
and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits
(QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates
computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S
gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.
This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover
optimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing quantum
circuits for specific tasks is crucial for enhancing performance and
efficiency. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly
growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology.
The field is expected to provide new opportunities, especially regarding high
sensitivity and precision. Entanglement is one of the key factors in achieving
high sensitivity and measurement precision [3]. This paper presents a novel
approach utilizing quantum machine learning techniques to optimize entanglement
distribution in quantum sensor circuits. By leveraging reinforcement learning
within a quantum environment, we aim to optimize the entanglement layout to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy, which are
key indicators of a quantum system's sensitivity and coherence, while
minimizing circuit depth and gate counts. Our implementation, based on Qiskit,
integrates noise models and error mitigation strategies to simulate realistic
quantum environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in
circuit performance and sensitivity, highlighting the potential of machine
learning in quantum circuit optimization by measuring high QFI and entropy in
the range of 0.84-1.0 with depth and gate count reduction by 20-86%.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing
and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing
these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in
large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and
efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering
integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation
(MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits
with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt
tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS)
representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix
approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while
reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent
improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the
0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results
highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor
networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.
