In recent years, deep neural networks\nhave emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional, computationally\nexpensive CFD simulations for modeling surface pressure fields.

We systematically scored\neach task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence,\nCreativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35\nparameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task\narchetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks\nrequiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low\nroutineness, attracted the most AI engagement.

While this approach is standard, it can be\nless efficient than simply increasing the number of points from a single LD\nsequence. However, a single LD sequence does not permit statistical error\nestimates in the current framework. We propose to recast the MLQMC problem in a\nBayesian cubature framework, which uses a single LD sequence and quantifies\nnumerical error through the posterior variance of a Gaussian process (GP)\nmodel. When paired with certain LD sequences, GP regression and hyperparameter\noptimization can be carried out at only $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ cost, where $n$\nis the number of samples. Building on the adaptive sample allocation used in\ntraditional MLQMC, where the number of samples is doubled on the level with the\ngreatest expected benefit, we introduce a new Bayesian utility function that\nbalances the computational cost of doubling against the anticipated reduction\nin posterior uncertainty. We also propose a new digitally-shift-invariant (DSI)\nkernel of adaptive smoothness, which combines multiple higher-order DSI kernels\nthrough a weighted sum of smoothness parameters, for use with fast digital net\nGPs. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the performance of our fast\nBayesian MLQMC method and error estimates for both single-level problems and\nmultilevel problems with a fixed number of levels.

The\nevent-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and\ntheoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However,\nthe binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable\ninformation loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both\nlow-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the\nperformance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental\nresults with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level\nspiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a\nreduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on\nimage classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to\n3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization\nintervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce\nthe inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor\nof 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we\npropose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a\ncareful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight\na spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures.\nUsing our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy\nresults in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network\nactivity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ea7\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u548cSparse - ResNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7f51\u7edc\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNNs\uff09\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8109\u51b2\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ea7\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u67b6\u6784Sparse - ResNet\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u7ea7SNNs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e2\u52303\u500d\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u81f31\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff1bSparse - ResNet\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u6d3b\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8520%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ea7\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u548cSparse - ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347SNNs\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the\nsame state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their\ntransition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,\nwhen multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to\nfind a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,\ni.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We\ngeneralize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show\nthat ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which\nwe call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any\narbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its\ntransition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward\nfunctions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and\napproximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,\nand thus ME-POMDPs.

Our findings highlight that improving the quality\nof model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for\nstrengthening the security of AI-generated code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRefleXGen\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u6280\u672f\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "RefleXGen\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5982GPT - 3.5 Turbo\u63d0\u534713.6%\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u52a0\u5f3aAI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The approach builds a self-normalized pivot from the indicator score\nfor a fixed quantile threshold and then employs a constrained empirical\nsaddlepoint approximation to obtain highly accurate tail probabilities.\nInverting these tail areas yields confidence intervals and tests without\nestimating the unknown density at the target quantile, thereby eliminating\nbandwidth selection and the boundary issues that affect kernel-based\nWald/Hall-Sheather intervals.

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow.

We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset.

Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly\nproposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely\nengineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes\nsoftware engineering program repair into four components governed by respective\nsub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch\nrevision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any\nindividual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined\nsub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific\nsub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on\nSWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and\n94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within\nSWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which\nwere subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary\nobstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing\nsuccessful reproduction tests.

Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an\neconomic side, as development time efforts are required to build the\ninteroperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field\nof large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of\nLLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,\nwithout human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated\nfour versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We\nperformed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two\ndifferent strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the\nconsistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b\nwas the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=\n0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset\nversions.

In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy\ncompression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific\ndata. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via\nZ-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to\nenhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with\nspatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the\nmodel performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback\ncorrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis\ndatasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ncompressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error\nbounds.

In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional\nframework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture\nsyntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual\ngraph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and\nlong-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for\nfine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse\nmulti-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations.

We first provide a formulation of\nthe data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is\ngenerated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,\ninterestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically\nidentified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent\nvariables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses\nvariational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train\nreward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields\nmore robust reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6062\u590d\u53d8\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5229\u7528\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u7531\u865a\u5047\u548c\u975e\u865a\u5047\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6062\u590d\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u671f\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

A general assumption of\ntraining the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that\nthe errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error\ncorrelations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly\nformulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is\nintroduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned\ncoefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an\ninference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically\nrefine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time\nforecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on\ndifferent traffic datasets.

However,\nsignificant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical\nspaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level\nactions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large\nlanguage models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor\ngeneralization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I\ninjects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while\nmaintaining language competence.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a\npromising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to\ncomplex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable\nnature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear\noptimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training\non sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited\nsequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging\nits warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient\nslope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in\ndeeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,\nwe find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much\nmore pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead\nto a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we\npropose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to\nbootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment\ninteractions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive\nslope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an\naverage return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,\nincluding Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points\nunder the same conditions.

However, the coordinate-wise\npreconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to\northogonal transformations of feature space.

This study tackles such difficulties using the\nTennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate\ndynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts\nwith standard models revealed limitations in both performance and\ninterpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By\nemploying SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a\nmore manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process\nfeatures driving fault predictions.

Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound\ntightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold\ndiscretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with\ndecomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.\nThe BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further\nalleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.\nBased on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both\nbinary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and\ntesting performance than state-of-the-art methods.

It has important applications in\nspatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air\npollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of\nmissing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications\nwhere the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to\nbe monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art\nassumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model\ninput are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$\nvariables in the input has never been studied.

While generative reward models (GRMs)\noffer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training\nparadigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad\nlabels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex\npairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,\npoint-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven\ncriteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs.

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA\nperformance by maintaining competitive accuracy.

While watermarking\nmethods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to\nopen-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the\ndecoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means\nto verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in\nembedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.\nA promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an\nopen one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between\nlearned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications\nsuch as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nPRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO\njointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that\nare easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.\nA regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes\ndegradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits.\nExperiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO\nsubstantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model\nmodifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5PRO\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u96be\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u4e0b\u6e38\u4fee\u6539\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c34\u5370\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u6a21\u62df\u4e0b\u6e38\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u60e9\u7f5a\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLaMA - 3.2\u3001LLaMA - 3\u3001Phi - 2\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cPRO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PRO\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we establish a theoretical\nframework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.\nStarting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation\nof the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we\nderive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is\nrelated to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and\nis approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and\na variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling\nstochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we\nobtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this\ntheoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which\nestimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target\ndomain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final\naccuracy over existing initialization methods.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic\nbenchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS\nimproves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$.

The analysis of human mobility has attracted the\nattention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific\ntasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human\nmobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various\ndownstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to\npush massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model,\ndiscover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban\nsensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility\ndata is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework\nnamed General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban\nsensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea\nand contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as\nnodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as\npeople-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time\ndynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states\nfor both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task\nis specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node\nembeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various\ntasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further\nconstruct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate\nGDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts\nof data.

In anomaly\ndetection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data\npoints. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,\nuser-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for\nthe complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we\nintroduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly\nDetection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find\nnovelties.\n  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different\ngeometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance\nmetrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score\nthat is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this\nmulti-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery\non astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.\nRubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the\nZwicky Transient Facility.\n  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --\nanomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other\nstate-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes\ndiscovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs\nsimilarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability.

As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based\ngenerative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic\nmulti-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph\nTransformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as\nthe characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data\nwith high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the\ntrack estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer\napproach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN\n(for group intent inference).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eNLP\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u7fa4\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u610f\u56fe\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7fa4\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7fa4\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u610f\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eFisher\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684NLP\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u56feTransformer\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7fa4\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eFisher\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8c03\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0cGTNN\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u7fa4\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8d8a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing\nFAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance\nbaselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and\nalignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100\nbenchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a\npowerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation.

Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves\nremarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to\ndownstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current\nmethods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by\ngradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during\nfine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located\nweights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which\nresults in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the\noptimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to\novercome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates\nthe weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two\nlow-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by\nintroducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the\nresulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,\nenabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant\nweights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that\nencourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their\nimportance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted\non classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different\npre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA\nperformance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.\n90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.\nCompared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%\nacross models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and\ncorresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements\nin interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

Further\nanalysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and\nprovides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u4e3a\u5a92\u4ecb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u795e\u7ecf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9010\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine\nprogressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a\nself-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative\nevolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically\nintegrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage\nreinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training\nparadigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of\nperceptual ability.

To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL\napproach for developing critiquing language models without stronger\nsupervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor\ngenerates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to\nunsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance\nimprovements.

However, most existing\naugmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes\n-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality\nsynthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is\nessential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as\ntraining data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and\nnetwork architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a\nnovel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the\ndata generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data\nvia downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight\nallocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic\nsample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data\ngeneration process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the\nsynthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative\nmodel to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts\ngeneration policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each\ngeneration round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying\ncomplexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over\nprevious SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that\nUtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating\nthe effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to\ntask utility-centric data augmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUtilGen\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8981\u6c42\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUtilGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cUtilGen\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524dSOTA\u63d0\u9ad83.87%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e14\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

In particular,\nthe gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied\nin recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent\nworks: the \\emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero\nunder preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD\navoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable\nquantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and\nstochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the\nnon-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as\nLipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for\ndeep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to\nGD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map\nas a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first\ntime, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss\nlandscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected,\nconvolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations\n(which includes sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, etc.) for almost all step-sizes.

Such RL-based solutions cannot\ngeneralize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns\nrather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These\nlimitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with\nhigh dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these\nlimitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning\nframework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of\ninformation (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive\npsychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven\nSystem 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and\nlogic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over\nreliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end\ndifferentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended\nhorizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment\ninteractions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model\ncan jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals\nwithout observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient\ndecisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based\non Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with\nmaterial properties.

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most\nwidely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition\napplications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering\ntaking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it\nprovides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the\ninformation about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet\ntransform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency\ninformation of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of\nnon-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform\nfrequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in\nanalysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies,\nand be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to\ndevelop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet\ntransform.

It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a\nlow-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal\nactively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations\ndegrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,\nimplying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining\nobjective.

A common\npractice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),\n  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,\nresidents, attending physicians) to simulate varied\n  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model\nreasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\n  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to\nevaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\n  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.\nWe test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to\nassess changes in reasoning pathways. Our\n  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the\nmedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\n  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of\ndistinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\n  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core\ndecision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform\n  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the\ncognitive complexity found in real-world medical\n  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and\nemphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine\n  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the\nrelated code in the following repository:https:\n  //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165RPNA\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5f53\u524d\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\uff08PBRP\uff09\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RP - Neuron - Activated Evaluation Framework (RPNA)\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5404\u4e34\u5e8a\u89d2\u8272\u95f4\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dPBRP\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u5236\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u4eff\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of\nunderlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across\nheterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the\nagent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves\nas an \"interlingua\" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent\ntraining pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to\ncapture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,\nsoftware engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to\nparse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,\nwe unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP\nformat, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for\nmultiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an\naverage performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers\nstate-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool\nuse, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data\nare released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to\nstandardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u534f\u8bae\uff08ADP\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ADP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c0613\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aADP\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6\u5316ADP\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u540eSFT\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fbeSOTA\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "ADP\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}
