Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5ffd\u89c6\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMoTS\u6846\u67b6\u548cSWAN\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSWAN\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6fc0\u52b1\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMoTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1SWAN\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u4ed8\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u539f\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSWAN\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad8352.42%\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u6fc0\u52b1\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e93.07%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SWAN\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions.

For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5904\u7406\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6216\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7cfb\u7edfAHA\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9ad8\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edfAHA\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cAHA\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u603b\u62e5\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u8fbe85\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AHA\u80fd\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this setting is fraught with the persistent challenge of false negatives, where unobserved user-item interactions are not necessarily indicative of negative preference. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel and principled loss function, named Corrected and Weighted (CW) loss, that systematically corrects for the impact of false negatives within the training objective. Our approach integrates two key techniques. First, inspired by Positive-Unlabeled learning, we debias the negative sampling process by re-calibrating the assumed negative distribution. By theoretically approximating the true negative distribution (p-) using the observable general data distribution (p) and the positive interaction distribution (p^+), our method provides a more accurate estimate of the likelihood that a sampled unlabeled item is truly negative. Second, we introduce a dynamic re-weighting mechanism that modulates the importance of each negative instance based on the model's current prediction. This scheme encourages the model to enforce a larger ranking margin between positive items and confidently predicted (i.e., easy) negative items, while simultaneously down-weighting the penalty on uncertain negatives that have a higher probability of being false negatives.

The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08RNN\uff09\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6ce8\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76RNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u566a\u58f0\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u3001\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5355\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8c03\u8282\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "CTRNN\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u6ce8\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u73b0\u8c61\u6e90\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u968f\u673a\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u4eba\u5de5RNN\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces.\n  We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries.

Recently, the statistics and machine learning communities have developed prediction-oriented inference approaches that provide better calibrated uncertainties and adapt to the level of misspecification present. However, these approaches have yet to be demonstrated in the context of complex scientific applications where phenomena of interest are governed by physics-based models. Such settings often involve single realizations of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and nonlinear, computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps. This work investigates variational prediction-oriented inference in problems exhibiting these relevant features; namely, we consider a polynomial model and a contaminant transport problem governed by advection-diffusion equations. The prediction-oriented loss is formulated as the log-predictive probability of the calibration data. We study the effects of increasing misspecification and noise, and we assess approximations of the predictive density using Monte Carlo sampling and component-wise kernel density estimation. A novel aspect of this work is applying prediction-oriented inference to the calibration of model-form uncertainty (MFU) representations, which are embedded physics-based modifications to the governing equations that aim to reduce (but rarely eliminate) model misspecification.

The architecture combines a Transformer-based temporal encoder, which captures non-stationary, complex, temporal dependencies, with an edge-aware graph attention network that propagates cross-asset information over the equity network. Inputs span daily returns, technicals, sector structure, previous correlations, and macro signals, enabling regime-aware forecasts and attention-based feature and neighbor importance to provide interpretability. Out-of-sample results from 2019-2024 show that the proposed model meaningfully reduces correlation forecasting error relative to rolling-window estimates. When integrated into a graph-based clustering framework, forward-looking correlations produce adaptable and economically meaningfully baskets, particularly during periods of market stress.

Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system.

Despite its modeling advantages, optimization under GNL is highly challenging: even the pure assortment problem is NP-hard, and existing approaches rely on approximation schemes or are limited to simple cardinality constraints. In this paper, we develop the first exact and near-exact algorithms for constrained assortment and joint assortment--pricing optimization (JAP) under GNL. Our approach reformulates the problem into bilinear and exponential-cone convex programs and exploits convexity, concavity, and submodularity properties to generate strong cutting planes within a Branch-and-Cut framework (B\\&C). We further extend this framework to the mixed GNL (MGNL) model, capturing heterogeneous customer segments, and to JAP with discrete prices. For the continuous pricing case, we propose a near-exact algorithm based on piecewise-linear approximation (PWLA) that achieves arbitrarily high precision under general linear constraints. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially outperform state-of-the-art approximation approaches in both solution quality and scalability. In particular, we are able to solve large-scale instances with up to 1000 products and 20 nests, and to obtain near-optimal solutions for continuous pricing problems with negligible optimality gaps.

In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \"Parameter-Space Intervention\" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities.

Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p >> n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff08AJL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u529f\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eAJL\u5177\u6709 oracle \u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "AJL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u53d8\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u540e\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002"}}

We propose roofs, a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. Roofs benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports that summarize a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, reliability of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of roofs on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. The PIONeeR dataset contained 374 multi-source blood and tumor biomarkers from 435 patients. A reduced subset of 214 features was obtained through iterative variance inflation factor pre-filtering. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in roofs, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models in total) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including the widely used LASSO.

Their success is based on the principle of similarity at its heart, assuming that similar molecules exhibit close properties. However, activity cliffs challenge this principle, and their presence leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing ML algorithms, particularly graph-based methods. To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace.

Version 8", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $\u0394< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $\u0394< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems.

We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton).

The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\u03c1= -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics.

The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.\n  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's \"relational color refinement\" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.\n  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u81ea\u7531\u8fde\u901a\u65e0\u73af\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\uff08fc - ACQs\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u7d22\u5f15\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u81ea\u7531\u8fde\u901a\u65e0\u73af\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\uff08fc - ACQs\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5143\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5206\u662f\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93$D_{col}$\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0eScheidt\u548cSchweikardt\u7684\u201c\u5173\u7cfb\u989c\u8272\u7ec6\u5316\u201d\u5206\u914d\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55fc - ACQ $Q$\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e0e$D_{col}$\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u5e38\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5730\u8ba1\u6570\u6216\u679a\u4e3e$Q$\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff1b$D_{col}$\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\uff09\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e5f\u4e0e$D$\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u6709fc - ACQs\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e25\u683c\u5c0f\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., \"true\" and \"false\") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u4e14\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u5728TREC - DL 2019\u81f32023\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u7ea640% - 50%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5668UMBRELA\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5224\u65ad\u5668\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u548c\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These simulators pose substantial challenges for integrating evolutionary computation (EC) into scientific design workflows. Evolutionary computation typically requires numerous design evaluations, making the integration of slow, low-throughput simulators particularly challenging, as they are optimized for accuracy and ease of use rather than throughput. We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges.

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately.

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u9884\u5148\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7531\u5185\u90e8\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56e0\u5b50\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicators. Second, Random Forest models capture nonlinear interactions among macro financial drivers and lagged Treasury yields. Third, distributionally robust forecast combination schemes aggregate heterogeneous forecasts under moment uncertainty, penalizing downside tail risk via expected shortfall and stabilizing second moment estimation through ridge regularized covariance matrices. The severity of the worst case criterion is adjustable, allowing the forecaster to regulate the trade off between robustness and statistical efficiency. Using monthly data, we evaluate out of sample forecasts across maturities and horizons from one to twelve months ahead. Adaptive combinations deliver superior performance at short horizons, while Random Forest forecasts dominate at longer horizons. Extensions to global sovereign bond yields confirm the stability and generalizability of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u503a\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u671f\u9650\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u671f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u6743\u503a\u5238\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u503a\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u56e0\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001Nelson - Siegel\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u6743\u503a\u5238\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

On average, female Chinese scientists require fewer citations on average than non-Chinese women where male Chinese scientists require more citations than their non-Chinese counterparts to attain a tenure-track professorial job of a given prestige rating.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u534e\u6b67\u89c6\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7f8e\u7537\u5973\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u664b\u5347\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8c03\u67e5\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u53cd\u534e\u6b67\u89c6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u7f8e\u56fd\u524d100\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7cfb\u5168\u4f53\u6559\u5e08\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u5973\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u5973\u6027\u6559\u6388\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u7537\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u7537\u6027\u6559\u6388\u4e2d\u7684\u5360\u6bd4\uff1b\u4e2d\u56fd\u7537\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f15\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5973\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5f15\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u5b9a\u58f0\u671b\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u6559\u804c\u5c97\u4f4d\u65f6\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5973\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6bd4\u975e\u534e\u88d4\u5973\u6027\u6240\u9700\u5f15\u7528\u5c11\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7537\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6bd4\u975e\u534e\u88d4\u7537\u6027\u6240\u9700\u5f15\u7528\u591a\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCAST\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u89c6Transformer\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u610f\u5916\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConflict - Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u91cf\u201c\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u201d\u5934\uff1b\u8df3\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CAST\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.\n  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.\n  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure.

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries.

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines. Furthermore, the inclusion of the self-reflective loop yielded substantial gains, increasing accuracy on MedQA from 80.00% to 83.33% and on PubMedQA from 69.10% to 79.82%. These findings confirm that integrating hybrid retrieval with iterative, evidence-based self-reflection effectively reduces unsupported claims and enhances the clinical reliability of LLM-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSelf - MedRAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf - MedRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u7528RRF\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u5faa\u73af\u4f7fMedQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece80.00%\u63d0\u5347\u523083.33%\uff0cPubMedQA\u4ece69.10%\u63d0\u5347\u523079.82%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u65ad\u8a00\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable \"rhythm generator\" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.\n  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.\n  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).\n  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u76f8\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u76f8\u91cf\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u79bb\u5524\u9192\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5de9\u56fa\u89e3\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u673a\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u632f\u8361\u57fa\u5e95\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u7ebf\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u5165\u4e0d\u826f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8868\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u56e0\u7d20\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u8026\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5524\u9192\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5de9\u56fa\uff0c\u53d7\u7a81\u89e6\u6807\u8bb0 - \u6355\u83b7\u548c\u7761\u7720\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5404\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5982 eligibility traces \u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u7528\u3001\u76f8\u76f8\u5e72\u68c0\u7d22\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u5524\u9192\u548c\u7761\u7720\u6269\u5927\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001REM \u91cd\u653e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ff7\u5bab\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u51fa\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u632f\u8361\u57fa\u5e95\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Yet, the absence of a unified trust foundation across data, services, and knowledge layers undermines reliability, accountability, and regulatory compliance in real-world deployments. While existing surveys address isolated aspects, such as data governance, service orchestration, and knowledge representation, none provides a holistic, cross-layer perspective on trustworthiness tailored to industrial settings. To bridge this gap, we present \\textsc{Trisk} (TRusted Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge governance), a novel conceptual and taxonomic framework for trustworthy industrial intelligence. Grounded in a five-dimensional trust model (quality, security, privacy, fairness, and explainability), \\textsc{Trisk} unifies 120+ representative studies along three orthogonal axes: governance scope (data, service, and knowledge), architectural paradigm (centralized, federated, or edge-embedded), and enabling technology (knowledge graphs, zero-trust policies, causal inference, etc.). We systematically analyze how trust propagates across digital layers, identify critical gaps in semantic interoperability, runtime policy enforcement, and operational/information technologies alignment, and evaluate the maturity of current industrial implementations. Finally, we articulate a forward-looking research agenda for Industry 5.0, advocating for an integrated governance fabric that embeds verifiable trust semantics into every layer of the industrial intelligence stack.

Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter.

Whether participation in these trials reflects the global burden of disease remains unclear. Here we analyze participation inequality across more than 62,000 randomized controlled trials spanning 16 major disease categories from 2000 to 2024. Linking 36.8 million trial participants to country-level disease burden, we show that global inequality in clinical trial participation is overwhelmingly structured by country rather than disease. Country-level factors explain over 90% of variation in participation, whereas disease-specific effects contribute only marginally. Removing entire disease categories, including those traditionally considered underfunded, has little effect on overall inequality. Instead, participation is highly concentrated geographically, with a small group of countries enrolling a disproportionate share of participants across nearly all diseases. These patterns have persisted despite decades of disease-targeted funding and increasing alignment between research attention and disease burden within diseases.

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdaptEval\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u7528\u9002\u5e94\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u7684AdaptEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5bf96\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u548c3\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "AdaptEval\u80fd\u4ece\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u9075\u5faa\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671bAdaptEval\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u4f20\u9012\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\u8f6c\u79fb\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u903b\u8f91\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We analyze intraday transition dynamics of ask and bid orders across market capitalization tiers using high-frequency NASDAQ100 tick data. Employing a discrete-time Markov chain framework, we categorize consecutive price changes into nine states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ($\\mathtt{HMC}$), Medium ($\\mathtt{MMC}$), and Low ($\\mathtt{LMC}$) market cap stocks. Element-wise TPM comparison reveals systematic patterns: price inertia peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing midday. A capitalization gradient is observed: $\\mathtt{HMC}$ stocks exhibit the strongest inertia, while $\\mathtt{LMC}$ stocks show lower stability and wider spreads. Markov metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence times, quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal phases on the bid side -- Opening, Midday, and Closing, and four phases on the ask side by distinguishing Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close. This indicates that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and mild price changes. Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the closing hour as the most distinct phase, with capitalization modulating temporal contrasts and bid-ask asymmetry. These findings support capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u7eb3\u65af\u8fbe\u514b100\u6307\u6570\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u4e70\u5356\u8ba2\u5355\u65e5\u5185\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u683c\u60ef\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u5e02\u503c\u68af\u5ea6\u7b49\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5236\u5b9a\u8003\u8651\u5e02\u503c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u7406\u89e3\u9650\u4ef7\u8ba2\u5355\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u4e3a\u4e5d\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u516d\u4e2a\u65e5\u5185\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4ef7\u683c\u60ef\u6027\u5728\u5f00\u76d8\u548c\u6536\u76d8\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u5348\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5927\u76d8\u80a1\u60ef\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c0f\u76d8\u80a1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u4ef7\u5dee\u5927\uff1b\u4e70\u5356\u4fa7\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u9650\u4ef7\u8ba2\u5355\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u4e2d\u6027\u548c\u6e29\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff1b\u6536\u76d8\u65f6\u6bb5\u6700\u72ec\u7279\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5236\u5b9a\u8003\u8651\u5e02\u503c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making.

Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.\n  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.\n  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds\" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.\n  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions.

Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of traditional optimization methods that ignore energy constraints. This work presents EARL, an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with an adaptive reinforcement learning based selection policy to jointly optimize accuracy and energy consumption. EARL employs surrogate modeling for global exploration, reinforcement learning for dynamic candidate prioritization, and an early termination mechanism to eliminate redundant evaluations, substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EARL achieves 6 to 15 percent higher accuracy, 60 to 80 percent lower energy consumption, and up to an order of magnitude reduction in optimization time compared to leading hyperparameter tuning frameworks.

This paper develops a dynamic model in which firms invest in purpose to enhance job meaning and motivate effort. Workers, who differ in productivity, choose both productive and socialization effort, gaining utility from income and meaning. Purpose accumulates over time through firm investment and interacts with socialization to generate meaning, which boosts productivity. Firms invest in purpose only insofar as it raises profits. We characterize the unique equilibrium, including steady state and transition dynamics. Meaning and purpose rise with the importance workers place on meaning and with firm's patience, but fall with depreciation and socialization costs. The relationship with workers' share of output is nonmonotonic. We also show that some intermediate level of heterogeneity in skills is best for performance. Compared to a worker-owned firm, profit-maximizing firms underinvest in purpose, highlighting a misalignment between firm incentives and worker preferences.

It executed flawlessly, yet when asked \"Why is completion rate 80%?\", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about.

We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how.

These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks.

We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity.

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital.

Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties.

However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%.

From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \\cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020).\n  Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrovi\u0107 and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Many different free-surface models have been proposed, which span modeling complexity from the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Particularly efficient methods can be derived by depth-averaging, resulting in dimensionally reduced models. Typically, this yields hierarchies of models -- models with a variable system structure depending on the polynomial expansion of the flow variables -- that need to be analyzed and numerically solved.\n  This description, analysis, and simulation are challenging, and existing software solutions only cover a specific subset of models generated by these hierarchies. We propose a new software framework to address this issue. Zoomy allows for an efficient description, symbolic analysis, and numerical solution of depth-averaged hierarchies of free-surface flow models. Zoomy handles a numerical discretization in one- and two-dimensional space on unstructured grids.\n  With this framework, systematic evaluation of hierarchies of depth-averaged free-surface flows becomes feasible.

It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements.

Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes.

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u57fa\u51c6SciIF\u8bc4\u4f30\u79d1\u5b66\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u53ea\u6ce8\u91cd\u8868\u9762\u683c\u5f0f\u6216\u53ea\u770b\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u79d1\u5b66\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u57fa\u51c6SciIF\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u5b66\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u76ee\u5f55\u4ece\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "result": "SciIF\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "SciIF\u53ef\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements.

Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.\n  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.\n  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.\n  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime.

We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u542b\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u590d\u5236\u805a\u5408\u5668\u4ee5\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a9\u7801\u5e76\u52a0\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5747\u5300\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5404\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5728\u542b\u6076\u610f\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u771f\u76f8\u548c\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6216\u53cd\u9a73\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\uff0c\u62a4\u680f\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u662f\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u771f\u76f8\u8fd8\u662f\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u8f7b\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u9519\u8bef\u89c2\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9879\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0eGPT - 4o\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9a73\u6216\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u62a4\u680f\u7684GPT - 4o\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0a\u540c\u6837\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u7684AI\u8bc4\u4ef7\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u6807\u51c6GPT - 4o\u6548\u679c\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u62a4\u680f\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5927\uff1b\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4f20\u64ad\u771f\u76f8\u548c\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains.

Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution.

Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u547d\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790Qwen3\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u660e\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u547d\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728PropLogic - MI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9Qwen3\uff088B\u548c14B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u987e\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Expressing anger towards ChatGPT also led to a higher albeit smaller improvement relative to the neutral condition, whereas blaming ChatGPT did not improve its answers. When addressing an ethical dilemma, ChatGPT prioritized corporate interests less when participants expressed anger towards it, while blaming increases its emphasis on protecting the public interest. Additionally, we found that people used more negative, hostile, and disappointing expressions in human-human communication after interactions during which participants blamed rather than praised for their responses.

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability.

To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples.

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm.

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u6e90\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4eba\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u667a\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4eba\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u53ef\u6e90\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u52a9\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLEGATO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165LEGATO\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecfODE\u9002\u914d\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLEGATO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "LEGATO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8eab\u4efd\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Several prior generative models are limited to generating partial neural network weights, particularly for larger models, such as ResNet and ViT. Those that do generate complete weights struggle with generation speed or require finetuning of the generated models. In this work, we present DeepWeightFlow, a Flow Matching model that operates directly in weight space to generate diverse and high-accuracy neural network weights for a variety of architectures, neural network sizes, and data modalities. The neural networks generated by DeepWeightFlow do not require fine-tuning to perform well and can scale to large networks.

Therefore, most systems adopt a \\emph{gather-and-refine} strategy, where a lightweight gather phase selects candidates for full scoring. However, this approach requires expensive searches over large token-level indexes and often misses the documents that would rank highest under full similarity. In this paper, we reproduce several state-of-the-art multivector retrieval methods on two publicly available datasets, providing a clear picture of the current multivector retrieval field and observing the inefficiency of token-level gathering. Building on top of that, we show that replacing the token-level gather phase with a single-vector document retriever -- specifically, a learned sparse retriever (LSR) -- produces a smaller and more semantically coherent candidate set. This recasts the gather-and-refine pipeline into the well-established two-stage retrieval architecture. As retrieval latency decreases, query encoding with two neural encoders becomes the dominant computational bottleneck. To mitigate this, we integrate recent inference-free LSR methods, demonstrating that they preserve the retrieval effectiveness of the dual-encoder pipeline while substantially reducing query encoding time. Finally, we investigate multiple reranking configurations that balance efficiency, memory, and effectiveness, and we introduce two optimization techniques that prune low-quality candidates early. Empirical results show that these techniques improve retrieval efficiency by up to 1.8$\\times$ with no loss in quality. Overall, our two-stage approach achieves over $24\\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art multivector retrieval systems, while maintaining comparable or superior retrieval quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u590d\u73b0\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u63a8\u7406LSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8524\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7a77\u4e3e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c gather - and - refine\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u6613\u6f0f\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u590d\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08LSR\uff09\u66ff\u6362\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u6536\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65e0\u63a8\u7406LSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53471.8\u500d\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a0\u901f\u8d8524\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios.

Reproducibility is essential to the scientific method, but reproduction is often a laborious task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process and relieve researchers of this workload. However, due to varying definitions of reproducibility, a clear problem statement is missing. Objectives. Create a generalisable problem statement, applicable to any empirical study. We hypothesise that we can represent any empirical study using a structure based on the scientific method and that this representation can be automatically extracted from any publication, and captures the essence of the study. Methods. We apply our definition of reproducibility as a problem statement for the automatisation of reproducibility by automatically extracting the hypotheses, experiments and interpretations of 20 studies and assess the quality based on assessments by the original authors of each study. Results. We create a dataset representing the reproducibility problem, consisting of the representation of 20 studies. The majority of author feedback is positive, for all parts of the representation. In a few cases, our method failed to capture all elements of the study. We also find room for improvement at capturing specific details, such as results of experiments. Conclusions. We conclude that our formulation of the problem is able to capture the concept of reproducibility in empirical AI studies across a wide range of subfields.

We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions (\"position shift\") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup.

RAGVUE decomposes RAG behavior into retrieval quality, answer relevance and completeness, strict claim-level faithfulness, and judge calibration. Each metric includes a structured explanation, making the evaluation process transparent. Our framework supports both manual metric selection and fully automated agentic evaluation. It also provides a Python API, CLI, and a local Streamlit interface for interactive usage.

One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f02\u6b65\u5206\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u5f02\u6b65\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u98ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b8b\u75be\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u4f46\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f02\u6b65\u5206\u7c7b\u89e3\u7801\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u670914\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u4e3b\u624b\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u4f2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u548cEEGNet\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u4f2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7a97\u53e3\u6570\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7a97\u53e3\u6570\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u5408\u9002\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u5f02\u6b65\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions.

This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone.

This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios.

Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.

However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeurosymbolic RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e09\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeurosymbolic RAG\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aMAR\u7528\u8c03\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdb\u67e5\u8be2\u5d4c\u5165\uff1bKG - Path RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff1bProcess Knowledge - infused RAG\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u5177\u91cd\u6392\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Neurosymbolic RAG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4efd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u526f\u672c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e\u672a\u6c61\u67d3\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63ed\u793aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548cMATH\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u526f\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5355\u4efd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u526f\u672c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e\u672a\u6c61\u67d3\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c61\u67d3\u91cf\uff1b\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6e29\u5ea6\u51cf\u8f7b\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u957f\u7b54\u6848\u66f4\u96be\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u51f8\u663eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation.

We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across five top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered high utility, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citation-context mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata.

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c47\u603b\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u504f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u5e38\u5438\u6536\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u793e\u4f1a\u8eab\u4efd\u5bf9\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u51cf\u6cd5\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u504f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u65cf\uff0c\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e24\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SCM \u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u51cf\u6cd5\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6c47\u603b\u65b9\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u8d56\u5d4c\u5165\u65cf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528 SCM \u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u89e3\u504f\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u805a\u5408\u548c\u89e3\u504f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level).

These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars.

In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?\n  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time (\"rate, not fate\"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary.

While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model.

However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets.

The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83).

Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity.

Results show that text-only embeddings often achieve stronger performance in detecting SSRL behaviors related to enactment or group dynamics (e.g., off-task behavior or requesting assistance). In contrast, contextual and multimodal features provide complementary benefits for constructs such as planning and reflection.

Recent advances in deep learning address this challenge by representing MILP instances as variable-constraint bipartite graphs and applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract latent structural patterns and enhance solver efficiency. However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view.

Under review at IJCAI", "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios.

Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty.

While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \\textbf{Agent QA}, \\textbf{Agent Code}, \\textbf{Agent Web}, and \\textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \\textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\\% of planning attacks, 77.97\\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats.

Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), RLVR lets an LLM generate multiple candidate solutions and reinforces those that lead to a verifiably correct final answer. However, in practice, RLVR often requires thousands of training steps to reach strong performance, incurring substantial computation largely attributed to prolonged exploration. In this work, we make a surprising observation: during RLVR, LLMs evolve in a strongly linear manner. Specifically, both model weights and model output log-probabilities exhibit strong linear correlations with RL training steps. This suggests that RLVR predominantly amplifies trends that emerge early in training, rather than continuously discovering new behaviors throughout the entire optimization trajectory. Motivated by this linearity, we investigate whether future model states can be predicted from intermediate checkpoints via extrapolation, avoiding continued expensive training. We show that Weight Extrapolation produces models with performance comparable to standard RL training while requiring significantly less computation. Moreover, Logits Extrapolation consistently outperforms continued RL training on all four benchmarks by extrapolating beyond the step range where RL training remains stable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u89c2\u5bdfRLVR\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6743\u91cd\u5916\u63a8\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6743\u91cd\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fbe\u6807\u51c6RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5916\u63a8\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6301\u7eedRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale.

We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u91cd\u65b0\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6700\u591a12\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd3D\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5728\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery.

Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFENCE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFENCE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u540e\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c03\u6574\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6309\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u805a\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFENCE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FENCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u8282\u70b9\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence.

Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data.

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective.

While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting.

However, several phenomena remain poorly understood, including the reduction in output diversity. To gain a broader understanding of RL post-training, we analyze the learning dynamics of RL post-training from a perspective that has been studied in supervised learning but remains underexplored in RL. We adopt an empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework and decompose the NTK into two components to characterize how RL updates propagate across training samples. Our analysis reveals that limited variability in feature representations can cause RL updates to systematically increase model confidence, providing an explanation for the commonly observed reduction in output diversity after RL post-training. Furthermore, we show that effective learning in this regime depends on rapidly shaping the classifier, which directly affects the gradient component of the NTK. Motivated by these insights, we propose classifier-first reinforcement learning (CF-RL), a simple two-stage training strategy that prioritizes classifier updates before standard RL optimization. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis by demonstrating increased model confidence and accelerated optimization under CF-RL. Additional analysis shows that the mechanism underlying CF-RL differs from that of linear-probing-then-fine-tuning in supervised learning.

Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning.

Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation.

However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints.

Classical heuristics struggle to adapt when travel times are highly asymmetric (e.g., one-way streets, congestion). A deep learning-based approach to the last-mile routing problem is presented to generate geographical zones composed of stop sequences to minimize last-mile delivery times.\n  The presented approach is an encoder-decoder architecture. Each route is represented as a complete directed graph whose nodes are stops and whose edge weights are asymmetric travel times. A Graph Neural Network encoder produces node embeddings that captures the spatial relationships between stops. A Pointer Network decoder then takes the embeddings and the route's start node to sequentially select the next stops, assigning a probability to each unvisited node as the next destination.\n  Cells of a Discrete Global Grid System which contain route stops in the training data are obtained and clustered to generate geographical zones of similar size in which the process of training and inference are divided. Subsequently, a different instance of the model is trained per zone only considering the stops of the training routes which are included in that zone.\n  This approach is evaluated using the Los Angeles routes from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Challenge. Results from general and zone-based training are compared, showing a reduction in the average predicted route length in the zone-based training compared to the general training. The performance improvement of the zone-based approach becomes more pronounced as the number of stops per route increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u7ebf\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u77ed\uff0c\u8def\u7ebf\u7ad9\u70b9\u8d8a\u591a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4f7f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u914d\u9001\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6307\u9488\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u505c\u9760\u70b9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u53d6\u5305\u542b\u505c\u9760\u70b9\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u5e76\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u7ebf\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u7ebf\u7684\u505c\u9760\u7ad9\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u914d\u9001\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates.

This work aims to continuously forecast the timing of future events by analyzing multi-sensor data streams.

To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams.

This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces.

The model suite includes satellite-based deep learning and optical-flow approaches and physics-based numerical weather prediction models, covering both deterministic and probabilistic formulations. Forecasts are first validated against satellite-derived surface solar irradiance (SSI). Irradiance fields are then converted into PV power using station-specific machine learning models, enabling comparison with production data from 6434 PV stations across Switzerland. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate spatiotemporal PV forecasting at a national scale. We additionally provide the first visualizations of how mesoscale cloud systems shape national PV production on hourly and sub-hourly timescales. Our results show that satellite-based approaches outperform the Integrated Forecast System (IFS-ENS), particularly at short lead times. Among them, SolarSTEPS and SHADECast deliver the most accurate SSI and PV power predictions, with SHADECast providing the most reliable ensemble spread. The deterministic model IrradianceNet achieves the lowest root mean square error, while probabilistic forecasts of SolarSTEPS and SHADECast provide better-calibrated uncertainty.

The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow.

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning.

We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency.

This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis.

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms.

In most environments, information is distributed across isolated files like reports and logs that lack explicit links.

To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency.

This work presents FibreCastML, an open, distribution-aware ML framework that predicts complete fibre diameter spectra from routinely reported electrospinning parameters and provides interpretable insights into process structure relationships.\n  A meta-dataset comprising 68538 individual fibre diameter measurements extracted from 1778 studies across 16 biomedical polymers was curated. Six standard processing parameters, namely solution concentration, applied voltage, flow rate, tip to collector distance, needle diameter, and collector rotation speed, were used to train seven ML models using nested cross validation with leave one study out external folds. Model interpretability was achieved using variable importance analysis, SHapley Additive exPlanations, correlation matrices, and three dimensional parameter maps.\n  Non linear models consistently outperformed linear baselines, achieving coefficients of determination above 0.91 for several widely used polymers. Solution concentration emerged as the dominant global driver of fibre diameter distributions. Experimental validation across different electrospinning systems demonstrated close agreement between predicted and measured distributions.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline.

Prior work suggests that stochastic gradient noise induces a Brownian-like expansion of the weight matrices W, whose growth is counteracted by WD, leading to a WD-noise equilibrium with a certain weight norm ||W||. In this work, we view the equilibrium norm as a harmful artifact of the training procedure, and address it by introducing learnable multipliers to learn the optimal scale. First, we attach a learnable scalar multiplier to W and confirm that the WD-noise equilibrium norm is suboptimal: the learned scale adapts to data and improves performance. We then argue that individual row and column norms are similarly constrained, and free their scale by introducing learnable per-row and per-column multipliers. Our method can be viewed as a learnable, more expressive generalization of muP multipliers. It outperforms a well-tuned muP baseline, reduces the computational overhead of multiplier tuning, and surfaces practical questions such as forward-pass symmetries and the width-scaling of the learned multipliers.

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code.

Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF.

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods.

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations.

In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training.

We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks.

We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task.

Recently, however, non-equivariant models have regained attention, due to their better runtime performance and imperfect symmetries that might arise in real-world applications. This has motivated the development of approximately equivariant models that strike a middle ground between respecting symmetries and fitting the data distribution. Existing approaches in this field usually apply sample-based regularisers which depend on data augmentation at training time, incurring a high sample complexity, in particular for continuous groups such as $SO(3)$. This work instead approaches approximate equivariance via a projection-based regulariser which leverages the orthogonal decomposition of linear layers into equivariant and non-equivariant components. In contrast to existing methods, this penalises non-equivariance at an operator level across the full group orbit, rather than point-wise.

Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOI - MAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOI - MAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "OI - MAS\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534712.88%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e79.78%\u3002", "conclusion": "OI - MAS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates.

So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents.

This simple modification mitigates the destructive effect of noise while preserving the original certification guarantees. We extend the analysis of noisy fine-tuning to the subspace setting, proving that the same $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$ privacy budget is retained.

Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1).

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models to reweight the JHFRAT scoring weights, while preserving its additive structure and clinical thresholds. Recalibration refers to adjusting item weights so that the resulting score can order encounters more consistently by the study's risk labels, and without changing the tool's form factor or deployment workflow. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). This performance improvement translates to protecting an additional 35 high-risk patients per week across the Johns Hopkins Health System. The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labeling.

Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAI\u52a9\u624b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u4f46\u5b66\u751f\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679010\u5468\u5b66\u671f\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540cSRL\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cSRL\u6c34\u5e73\u5b66\u751f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a9\u624b\u89e3\u91ca\u6e05\u6670\u4f46\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff1bGenAI\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4f4eSRL\u5b66\u751f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u5e72\u9884\u5bf9\u4f4eSRL\u5b66\u751f\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing.

By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research.

Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence.

However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bCoT\u751f\u6210\u6709\u2018\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConMax\u6846\u67b6\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387 - \u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684CoT\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConMax\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u8f85\u52a9LRM\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b54\u6848\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u601d\u8003\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cConMax\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c1143%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "ConMax\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387 - \u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation.

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u4e34\u754c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0eWSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u9002\u7528\u4e8eWSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2E(S)\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4fee\u8ba2\u516c\u5f0f\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_\u03b7) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $\u03bc$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $\u03bc$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings.

Existing backdoor methods predominantly rely on inserting visible triggers into visual modality, which suffer from poor robustness and low insusceptibility in real-world settings due to environmental variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the State Backdoor, a novel and practical backdoor attack that leverages the robot arm's initial state as the trigger. To optimize trigger for insusceptibility and effectiveness, we design a Preference-guided Genetic Algorithm (PGA) that efficiently searches the state space for minimal yet potent triggers.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction.

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9996\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u843d\u540e\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u8861\u91cf\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d5 - 10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e3a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002"}}

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFusionRoute\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c0f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFusionRoute\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7logit\u52a0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865logit\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7eaf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e92\u8865\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6269\u5145\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama - 3\u548cGemma - 2\u7cfb\u5217\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFusionRoute\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionRoute\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u56f0\u5883\u3002"}}

However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \\textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension.

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25.

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's \u03b1 = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (\u03b1 < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality.

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity.

Presented at SESAR Innovation Days 2025", "summary": "Conventional optimization-based metering depends on strict adherence to precomputed schedules, which limits the flexibility required for the stochastic operations of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). In contrast, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a decentralized, adaptive framework that can better handle uncertainty, required for safe aircraft separation assurance. Despite this advantage, current MARL approaches often overfit to specific airspace structures, limiting their adaptability to new configurations. To improve generalization, we recast the MARL problem in a relative polar state space and train a transformer encoder model across diverse traffic patterns and intersection angles. The learned model provides speed advisories to resolve conflicts while maintaining aircraft near their desired cruising speeds. In our experiments, we evaluated encoder depths of 1, 2, and 3 layers in both structured and unstructured airspaces, and found that a single encoder configuration outperformed deeper variants, yielding near-zero near mid-air collision rates and shorter loss-of-separation infringements than the deeper configurations. Additionally, we showed that the same configuration outperforms a baseline model designed purely with attention. Together, our results suggest that the newly formulated state representation, novel design of neural network architecture, and proposed training strategy provide an adaptable and scalable decentralized solution for aircraft separation assurance in both structured and unstructured airspaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u6781\u5750\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u98de\u673a\u5206\u9694\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5355\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709MARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7a7a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MARL\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u6781\u5750\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u7eaf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd1\u7a7a\u4e2d\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\u4fb5\u72af\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u77ed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u98de\u673a\u5206\u9694\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5206\u6563\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias.

A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark.

Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy.

This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpectraFormer\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784SiC\u62c9\u66fc\u57fa\u5e95\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e38\u89c4\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684ZLG\u632f\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3aSiC\u4e0a\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u62c9\u66fc\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u78b3\u5316\u7845\uff08SiC\uff09\u4e0a\u751f\u957f\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u65f6\uff0c\u53d7\u57fa\u5e95\u4e8c\u9636\u62c9\u66fc\u54cd\u5e94\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u51b2\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0eSiC\u80cc\u666f\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bSpectraFormer\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u751f\u957f\u540e\u90e8\u5206\u63a9\u853d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784SiC\u62c9\u66fc\u57fa\u5e95\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u51cf\u53bb\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u5e95\u4fe1\u53f7\u540e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4e0eZLG\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f31\u632f\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7ecf\u4ece\u5934\u7b97\u632f\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aSiC\u4e0a\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u62c9\u66fc\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u95ed\u73afAI\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u957f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling.

Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional \"Austral Tower\" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faConcept Tokens\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u7279\u6b8a\u4ee4\u724c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d27\u51d1\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u6599\uff0cConcept Tokens\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Concept Tokens\u80fd\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d27\u51d1\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines.

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms.

These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making.

Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6Minary\uff0c\u5b83\u6216\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u81ea\u751f\u4ea7\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7b49\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u81ea\u751f\u4ea7\u539f\u8bed\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u6982\u7387\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u591a\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u53e0\u52a0\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u968f\u673a\u4eff\u5c04\u6620\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u655b\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6781\u9650\u671f\u671b\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5171\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u80fd\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "Minary\u5728Maturana\u548cVarela\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c01\u95ed\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7ef4\u6301\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Human evaluation of 2000 synthetic products demonstrates high effectiveness, with 99.6% rated as natural, 96.5% containing valid attribute values, and over 90% showing consistent attribute usage. On the public MAVE dataset, our synthetic data achieves 60.5% accuracy, performing on par with real training data (60.8%) and significantly improving upon the 13.4% zero-shot baseline.

We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems.

However, existing approaches often rely on explicit action exchange between agents to evaluate action value functions, which is frequently impractical in real-world engineering environments due to communication constraints, latency, energy consumption, and reliability requirements. From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents' behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects.

At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low-priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations.

Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of \"hopping-too-late\" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning.

We propose Graph-GAP, a methodology that decomposes requirements from authoritative policy texts into a four layer graph of evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator, and that computes two metrics, GAP score and mitigation readiness, to identify governance gaps and prioritise actions. Using the UNICEF Innocenti Guidance on AI and Children 3.0 as primary material, we define reproducible extraction units, coding manuals, graph patterns, scoring scales, and consistency checks, and we demonstrate exemplar gap profiles and governance priority matrices for ten requirements. Results suggest that compared with privacy and data protection, requirements related to child well being and development, explainability and accountability, and cross agency implementation and resource allocation are more prone to indicator gaps and mechanism gaps. We recommend translating requirements into auditable closed loop governance that integrates child rights impact assessments, continuous monitoring metrics, and grievance redress procedures. At the coding level, we introduce a multi algorithm review aggregation revision workflow that runs rule based encoders, statistical or machine learning evaluators, and large model evaluators with diverse prompt configurations as parallel coders. Each extraction unit outputs evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator labels plus readiness scores with evidence anchors.

Standard anonymization techniques often disrupt linguistic fluency, while rigorous Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms typically degrade the statistical signals required for accurate detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{DP-MGTD}, a framework incorporating an Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization algorithm. Our approach utilizes a two-stage mechanism that performs noisy frequency estimation and dynamically calibrates privacy budgets, applying Laplace and Exponential mechanisms to numerical and textual entities respectively. Crucially, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon where the application of DP noise amplifies the distinguishability between human and machine text by exposing distinct sensitivity patterns to perturbation.

However, current IESs often rely on single-turn static question-answering, which fails to assess learners' cognitive levels, cannot adjust teaching strategies based on real-time feedback, and is limited to providing simple one-off responses. To address these issues, we introduce AgentTutor, a multi-turn interactive intelligent education system to empower personalized learning.

This paper offers a complementary perspective: a student-led field experiment embedded as a midterm project in UNIV 182 (AI4All) at George Mason University, a Mason Core course designed for undergraduates across disciplines with no expected prior STEM exposure. Student teams designed their own reasoning tasks, ran them on widely used consumer chatbots representative of current capabilities, and evaluated both (i) answer correctness and (ii) the validity of the chatbot's stated reasoning (for example, cases where an answer is correct but the explanation is not, or vice versa). Across eight teams that reported standardized scores, students contributed 80 original reasoning prompts spanning six categories: pattern completion, transformation rules, spatial/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, relational/logic reasoning, and analogical reasoning. These prompts yielded 320 model responses plus follow-up explanations. Aggregating team-level results, OpenAI GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 achieved the highest mean answer accuracy (86.2% and 83.8%), followed by Grok 4 (82.5%) and Perplexity (73.1%); explanation validity showed a similar ordering (81.2%, 80.0%, 77.5%, 66.2%). Qualitatively, teams converged on a consistent error signature: strong performance on short, structured math and pattern items but reduced reliability on spatial/visual reasoning and multi-step transformations, with frequent \"sound right but reason wrong\" explanations.

Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance. Notably, on the OPT-13B model, our method outperforms traditional ZO optimization across all 11 benchmark tasks and surpasses gradient-based baselines on 9 out of 11 tasks, establishing a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u5feb\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u5feb\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\uff0c\u5728OPT - 13B\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic conditions, deepfake generation is applied to isolated vocal components, followed by the reintroduction of background ambiance to suppress trivial artifacts and emphasize conversion-specific cues. We frame detection as a streaming classification task by dividing audio into one-second segments, extracting time-frequency and cepstral features, and training supervised machine learning models to classify each segment as real or voice-converted. The proposed system enables low-latency inference, supporting both segment-level decisions and call-level aggregation.

Existing methods often suffer from issues such as rhythmic inconsistency, motion jitter, foot sliding and limited multi-sampling diversity. In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively.

Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes.

Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u91cd\u590d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8be5\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u6709\u7c7b\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u91cd\u590d\u653f\u7b56\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u62dfSEIR\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u7c7b\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

However, realistic scenarios often demand delayed and variable-specific activation. We identify this critical unmet need and propose TDBA, a temporally decoupled backdoor attack framework for MTS forecasting. By injecting triggers that encode the expected location of the target pattern, TDBA enables the activation of the target pattern at any positions within the forecasted data, with the activation position flexibly varying across different variable dimensions. TDBA introduces two core modules: (1) a position-guided trigger generation mechanism that leverages smoothed Gaussian priors to generate triggers that are position-related to the predefined target pattern; and (2) a position-aware optimization module that assigns soft weights based on trigger completeness, pattern coverage, and temporal offset, facilitating targeted and stealthy attack optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that TDBA consistently outperforms existing baselines in effectiveness while maintaining good stealthiness. Ablation studies confirm the controllability and robustness of its design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08MTS\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTDBA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MTS\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDBA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDBA\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TDBA\u6846\u67b6\u5728MTS\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components.

The primary outcome was whether a correction received at least one ad hominem attack within a 24-hour window. Ad hominem attacks occurred in 72 percent of human-issued corrections and in none of the Grok-mediated corrections.

Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u91c7\u6837\u5c31\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u6210\u719f\u540e\u518d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u719f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5c31\u80fd\u4ea7\u51fa\u8fde\u8d2f\u591a\u6837\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8bcd\u5143\u8868\u793a\u6536\u655b\u540e\u518d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new \"A+B\" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u4e1aGenAI\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u533b\u836f\u9886\u57df\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3040\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u5982\u533b\u836f\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u4e1a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u81ea\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf940\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "SDPA\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u5546\u7528GPU\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad83 - 8\u500d\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57288/12\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u523b\u753b\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize \"lucky\" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity.

We further evaluate a deployment-time orientation search that selects a discrete rotation maximizing a forest-level confidence proxy without updating model parameters. Orientation search improves robustness under severe rotations but can be harmful near the canonical orientation when confidence is misaligned with correctness.

However, these strategies either require annotated data or fail to account for the fact that some prompts may negatively impact performance. In this work, we present an entropy-guided prompt weighting approach that aims to find a robust combination of prompt contributions to maximize prediction confidence. To this end, we formulate a tailored objective function that minimizes prediction entropy to yield new prompt weights, utilizing low-entropy as a proxy for high confidence. Our approach can be applied to individual samples or a batch of audio samples, requiring no additional labels and incurring negligible computational overhead.

Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator.

In this paper, we present UNIC, a unified multimodal framework for extrinsic contact estimation that operates without any prior knowledge or camera calibration. UNIC directly encodes visual observations in the camera frame and integrates them with proprioceptive and tactile modalities in a fully data-driven manner. It introduces a unified contact representation based on scene affordance maps that captures diverse contact formations and employs a multimodal fusion mechanism with random masking, enabling robust multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIC performs reliably. It achieves a 9.6 mm average Chamfer distance error on unseen contact locations, performs well on unseen objects, remains robust under missing modalities, and adapts to dynamic camera viewpoints.

While our focus is datacenter AI, we also review their applicability for mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u4e92\u8fde\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u4e92\u8fde\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u95ea\u5b58\u3001\u8fd1\u5185\u5b58\u5904\u7406\u548c3D\u5185\u5b58\u903b\u8f91\u5806\u53e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e92\u8fde\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u805a\u7126\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3AI\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u5173\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars).\n  Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u6210ALM\u548cVLM\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u526a\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5236\u836f\u4e1a\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5236\u836f\u4e1a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6311\u6218\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u526a\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684Cut & Merge\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03 - 4\u500d\u63d0\u901f\u30014\u500d\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u526a\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging).

The framework was trained and evaluated on a large-scale, clinically heterogeneous dataset comprising 4,121 scan sessions acquired at our institution over six years on four different 3 T MRI scanner systems, capturing real-world clinical variability. The framework integrates Bloch-based signal models directly into the training objective. Across more than 600 test sessions, the generated maps exhibited white matter and gray matter values consistent with literature ranges. Additionally, the generated maps showed invariance to scanner hardware and acquisition protocol groups, with inter-group coefficients of variation $\\leq$ 1.1%. Subject-specific analyses demonstrated excellent voxel-wise reproducibility across scanner systems and sequence parameters, with Pearson $r$ and concordance correlation coefficients exceeding 0.82 for T1 and T2.

We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR.

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish.

It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3ck - \u67d3\u8272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u67d3\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0cGNN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u67d3\u8272\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90fd\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u7528GNN\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u67d3\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d2a\u5fc3\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97(k - 1) - \u67d3\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u6539\u8fdb\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cGNN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\u56fe\u67d3\u8272\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Through five semi-structured focus groups (N=26) with young Canadians (ages 16-24), we investigate how perceived privacy risks (PPR) and benefits (PPBf) intersect with algorithmic transparency and trust (ATT) and privacy self-efficacy (PSE) to shape privacy-protective behaviors (PPB). Our analysis reveals that policy overload, fragmented settings, and unclear data retention undermine self-efficacy and discourage protective actions. Conversely, simple transparency cues were associated with greater confidence without diminishing the utility of hands-free tasks and entertainment.

While these devices provide convenience and efficiency, they also raise privacy and transparency concerns due to their always-listening design and complex data management processes. The study proposes and applies a combined framework of Heuristic Evaluation, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance Assessment, and Youth-Centered Usability Testing to assess whether these devices align with Privacy-by-Design principles and support meaningful user control. Results show that Google Home achieved the highest usability score, while Siri scored highest in regulatory compliance, indicating a trade-off between user convenience and privacy protection. Alexa demonstrated clearer task navigation but weaker transparency in data retention. Findings suggest that although youth may feel capable of managing their data, their privacy self-efficacy remains limited by technical design, complex settings, and unclear data policies.

An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance.

Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models.

The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate.

However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats.

The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers.

To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u7528GRPO\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGDPO\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aGDPO\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528GRPO\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u5956\u52b1\u89e3\u8026\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GDPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5355\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGDPO\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5b88\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u3002", "conclusion": "GDPO\u5bf9\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is \"ahead-of-time\", acting as a blind \"feed-forward\" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually \"one-off\", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faProMem\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001QA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\u548ctoken\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5185\u5b58\u63d0\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u63d0\u524d\u603b\u7ed3\u201d\u548c\u201c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u201d\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u5185\u5b58\u63d0\u53d6\uff08ProMem\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u67e5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "ProMem\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548cQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\u548ctoken\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "ProMem\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark.

StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement.\n  By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness.\n  To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space.\n  We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdStageSAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6d6e\u70b9\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u672f\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe99.4%\uff0c\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb5 - 10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d6e\u70b9\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning.

While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge.

They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality.

While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks.

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNeuronLLM\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u80fd\u529b\u534f\u8c03\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u6291\u5236\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u5076\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u8bef\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u62ee\u6297\u751f\u7269\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u597d\u574f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u51cf\u5c11\u5076\u7136\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56db\u4e2aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cNeuronLLM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuronLLM\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Second, we implement a two-stage classifier cascade where lightweight classifiers screen all traffic and escalate only suspicious exchanges to more expensive classifiers. Third, we train efficient linear probe classifiers and ensemble them with external classifiers to simultaneously improve robustness and reduce computational costs. Together, these techniques yield a production-grade system achieving a 40x computational cost reduction compared to our baseline exchange classifier, while maintaining a 0.05% refusal rate on production traffic.

However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions.

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines.

To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space.

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \\textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification.

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations.

Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research.

While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies.

Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW.

We present the first systematic analysis of role-based authority bias in free-form multi-agent evaluation using ChatEval. Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias.

Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development.\n  CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies.\n  We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs.

While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution.

Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing.

However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.\n  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash.

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u7ec4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u504f\u5411\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fd9\u79cd\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u6d88\u878d\u4e00\u7ec4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u4f7f\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81f3\u5c11\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684PIH\u5934\u4ee5\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ecb\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u590d\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u793a\u4f8b\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6574\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u6c60\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u6c60\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
