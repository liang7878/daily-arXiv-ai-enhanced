While existing\nmethods using One dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) excel at\nmineral identification through Raman spectroscopy, the crucial step of\ndetermining rock types from mineral assemblages remains unsolved, particularly\nbecause the same minerals can form different rock types depending on their\nproportions and formation conditions. This study presents a novel\nknowledge-enhanced deep learning approach that integrates geological domain\nexpertise with spectral analysis. The performance of five machine learning\nmethods were evaluated out of which the 1D-CNN and its uncertainty-aware\nvariant demonstrated excellent mineral classification performance\n(98.37+-0.006% and 97.75+-0.010% respectively). The integrated system's\nevaluation on rock samples revealed variable performance across lithologies,\nwith optimal results for limestone classification but reduced accuracy for\nrocks sharing similar mineral assemblages.

While\nthis approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an\nimportant role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems\nin an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional\napportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is\ndiscrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at\neach time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed\nnumber of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional\nshare rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to\neach party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.\n  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For\ndeterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that\nyield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the\nseats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is\nbest possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a\nmethod guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party\nup to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)\nexists if and only if $n\\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and\nshow that, for $n\\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota\nwith the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its\nproportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method\nsatisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively\nconstructed network.

Hybrid\napproaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as\nEBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent\nin SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel\ntraining framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for\nboth discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed\nmethod introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM\nlearning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by\ndiscriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using\nthe BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative\ncomponent that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need\nfor explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to\nresolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method\nsubstantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while\nmaintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for\ngenerative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN\nand approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach\nto achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our\napproach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and\ndemonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for\nunified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data."}

An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed\nnumber of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional\nshare rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to\neach party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.\n  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods.

To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce\nDeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level\nquality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,\nconsistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary\nevaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high\nagreement with human judgments.

With DNNs\ncharacterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining\ntheir optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework\nof Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical\nsystems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled\nanalysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical\npursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated\nobservation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation\nalgorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for\ndynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic\nprogramming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a\nvariational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the\nfirst-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring\nhigher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,\ntermed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich\nalgorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,\ngame-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time\nmodels such as Neural ODEs.

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on\nSFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and\napplications in this area."}

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise\nonline mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.\n{\\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern\nmatching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained\ntransformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that\nlanguage-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency\nof finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a\npractical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of\ngradient-based training."}

Inspired by the structure\nand function of biological cognition, this paper introduces the concept of\n\"Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence (NII),\" a hybrid approach that combines\nneuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, and AI to develop more\ngeneral, adaptive, and robust intelligent systems capable of rapid learning,\nlearning from less data, and leveraging prior experience. These systems aim to\nemulate the human brain's ability to flexibly learn, reason, remember,\nperceive, and act in real-world settings with minimal supervision. We review\nthe limitations of current AI methods, define core principles of\nneurocognitive-inspired intelligence, and propose a modular, biologically\ninspired architecture that emphasizes integration, embodiment, and\nadaptability. We also discuss potential implementation strategies and outline\nvarious real-world applications, from robotics to education and healthcare.\nImportantly, this paper offers a hybrid roadmap for future research, laying the\ngroundwork for building AI systems that more closely resemble human cognition."}

An ablation study shows that developments\nfrom the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly\ntransferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the\ngenerated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits\nwithout mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data.

We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments.

To enable\nthis study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of\nfine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math\ncompetitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from\nGemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as\na testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key\naxes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.\nOur analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong\nreasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking\nschemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive\nbaselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$\nselection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out\nof 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the\nhuman oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof\ngeneration."}

Across chemistry and\nphysics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL\nconsistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single\ndemonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance\non the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability.

Recently, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain\nknowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based\nKGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nKnowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination\nbetween LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process.

Contemporary methods (e.g.,\nFR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the\ntarget model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.\nAlthough this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency\nlists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static\nshortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected\nnumber of tokens per verification step.

To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model.

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/LaSeR", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance.

We\npresent an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces,\nperforming one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple\nunderlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic\nperceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based\nmodels, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy,\nsolely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing\nclicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible\npointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar\nend-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we\nincorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.\nThe agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without\nthe need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss\nthe simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct\nconfiguration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems."}

In contrast, many planners\ninteract better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,\ninteraction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in\nclosed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,\nwhen reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned\nplanners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable\nbasic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a\nnew standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a\ndrop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop."}

On ImageNet 256$^2$, it\nattains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT\narchitecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\\pi$-Flow achieves\nsubstantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while\nmaintaining teacher-level quality."}

Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired\ndatasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most\napproaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in\npose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability\nand limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we\n(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for\nmulti-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)\nintroduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the\ntrade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel\ntraining paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data\nto balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in\nWithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while\npreserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste\nartifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains\nstrong perceptual quality.

However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned\nrepresentations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D\nnature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and\ndiminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency."}

Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing."}
