When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The\ndiscussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape\nevaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design.

In parallel, we develop new theory around a number of\nyet-uncharted questions, related to the sampling complexity of peak inventory\nestimation as well as to the plausibility of groupwise synchronization.\nInterestingly, we establish the global nature of inventory staggering, proving\nthat there are $n$-item instances where, for every subset of roughly $\\sqrt{n}$\nitems, no policy improves on the worst-possible one by a factor greater than\n$1+\\epsilon$, whereas for the entire instance, there exists a policy that\noutperforms the worst-possible one by a factor of nearly $2$, which is optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58\u4ea4\u9519\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5206\u6790\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e93\u5b58\u4ea4\u9519\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u5386\u53f2\u60a0\u4e45\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\u532e\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5206\u6790\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5168\u65b0\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6052\u5b9a\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e93\u5b58\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58\u4ea4\u9519\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane in which\neach edge is crossed at most $k$ times. The local crossing number of a graph is\nthe minimum integer $k$ such that it is $k$-planar. The problem of determining\nwhether an input graph is $1$-planar is known to be NP-complete even for\nnear-planar graphs [Cabello and Mohar, SIAM J.

Moreover, the local\ncrossing number is hard to approximate within a factor $2 - \\varepsilon$ for\nany $\\varepsilon > 0$ [Urschel and Wellens, IPL 2021]. To address this\ncomputational intractability, Bannister, Cabello, and Eppstein [JGAA 2018]\ninvestigated the parameterized complexity of the case of $k = 1$, particularly\nfocusing on structural parameterizations on input graphs, such as treedepth,\nvertex cover number, and feedback edge number. In this paper, we extend their\napproach by considering the general case $k \\ge 1$ and give (tight)\nparameterized upper and lower bound results. In particular, we strengthen the\naforementioned lower bound results to subclasses of constant-treewidth graphs:\nwe show that testing $1$-planarity is NP-complete even for near-planar graphs\nwith feedback vertex set number at most $3$ and pathwidth at most $4$, and the\nlocal crossing number is hard to approximate within any constant factor for\ngraphs with feedback vertex set number at most $2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62d3\u5c55\u7814\u7a76k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u5b50\u7c7b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u89e3\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8ek = 1\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8003\u8651k \u2265 1\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u62d3\u5c55\u524d\u4eba\u5bf9k = 1\u60c5\u51b5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651k \u2265 1\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\uff08\u7d27\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6d4b\u8bd51-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u53c9\u6570\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u96be\u4ee5\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e00\u822ck \u2265 1\u7684k-\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u5b50\u7c7b\u7684\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Traditional Graph Neural\nNetworks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on\nsupervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in\nlabel-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled\nfine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face\nsignificant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning\nabilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and\nbeing limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM\n(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node\ndescription, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured\nnatural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which\nencodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained\nlanguage models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared\nto directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph\nrepresentation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a\nshared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph\nFoundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised\nperformance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and\ndemonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNOCL\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNOCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c06\u5f02\u8d28\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u6982\u5ff5\u7f16\u7801\u8282\u70b9\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "NOCL\u5728\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfMPNNs\u548c\u6df7\u5408LLM - MPNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCL\u4e3a\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While the\nproblem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation\nalgorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider\ndeterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the\nproblem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.\n  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set\n(MWIS) problem has a tight $\\Theta(\\log^*(n) / \\epsilon)$ complexity. The lower\nbound already holds on unweighted oriented paths.

We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10\nundergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield\ndevelopment tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a\nmixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and\nexit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)\nand made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot.

Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)\nhas been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training\ntime. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to\nother KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior\nperformance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models\ntend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,\nlike attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning\ndifficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet\npowerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues.

Additionally, LightKG incorporates an\nefficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node\nsimilarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation\nand comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and\ndense scenarios while significantly reducing training time.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings.

However, when applied to\nheterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,\nexisting RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice\nof flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular\nstructure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose\nTableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex\nmanipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:\ncontext-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and\nexecution, and compositional intermediate answer generation.

Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is\nfundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective\ndebugging and repair methods.

While the\noriginal RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in\nfast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be\naggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation\nsteps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in\nsettings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended\nred-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.\n  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue\npebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some\nsimple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal\nI/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor\nthis way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations\nallow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions,\na crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP\nmodel.

In other\nwords, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The\nresulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending\nnumber-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender\nsequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for\ninterpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer\nhidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic\nat scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender\nsequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,\nthe difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We\ndesign a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Grok, and LLaMA.

Our two\ninstantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with\nsamples from $q_\\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the\nloss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates\ndimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and\nmatches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all\nthe while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior\nmodel. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,\nserving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08VCL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u584c\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684VCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06InfoNCE\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u9879\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd1\u4f3c\u540e\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6295\u5f71\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u6837\u672c\u66ff\u6362\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u5728\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316KL\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVCL\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0e\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "VCL\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Dynamically selecting the\noptimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a\npromising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and\nperformance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive\nand often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on\nhuman-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in\nreal-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task\ndifficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that\ndynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically\nassessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using\nChain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into\nthree difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed\ndifficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best\nmodel for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental\nresults show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score\nwhile reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method\nComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an\napproximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of\ncost consumption.

While expert-curated taxonomies have\ntraditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.\nFurthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)\nover-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend\nheavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained\nwithin their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of\nevolving scientific domains.

To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a\nframework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus\nacross multiple dimensions.

However, Federated Audio Classification (FedAC) faces three critical\nchallenges that substantially hinder performance: data heterogeneity, model\nheterogeneity, and data poisoning. While prior works have attempted to address\nthese issues, they are typically treated independently, lacking a unified and\nrobust solution suited to real-world federated audio scenarios. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FedMLAC, a unified mutual learning framework designed to\nsimultaneously tackle these challenges in FedAC. Specifically, FedMLAC\nintroduces a dual-model architecture on each client, comprising a personalized\nlocal AC model and a lightweight, globally shared Plug-in model. Through\nbidirectional knowledge distillation, the Plug-in model enables global\nknowledge transfer while adapting to client-specific data distributions, thus\nsupporting both generalization and personalization. To further enhance\nrobustness against corrupted audio data, we develop a Layer-wise Pruning\nAggregation (LPA) strategy that filters unreliable Plug-in model updates based\non parameter deviations during server-side aggregation.

This practice is\nstatistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic\nsubgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision. Our contribution is twofold.

As CPS grow in\ncomplexity and scale, particularly in safety-critical and learning-enabled\nsettings, accurate analysis and synthesis increasingly rely on the rapid use of\nsimulation experiments. Because CPS inherently integrate hardware, software,\nand physical processes, simulation platforms must support co-simulation of\nheterogeneous components at varying levels of fidelity. Despite recent advances\nin high-fidelity modeling of hardware, firmware, and physics, co-simulation in\ndiverse environments remains challenging. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of reusable benchmarks and impede the use of simulation for\nautomated and comparative evaluation.\n  Existing simulation tools often rely on rigid configurations, lack automation\nsupport, and present obstacles to portability and modularity. Many are\nconfigured through static text files or impose constraints on how simulation\ncomponents are represented and connected, making it difficult to flexibly\ncompose systems or integrate components across platforms.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce MultiCoSim, a Python-based\nsimulation framework that enables users to define, compose, and configure\nsimulation components programmatically.

However, the traditional process for creating\nsuch benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in\nthe stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and\nvalidating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00.

A\nnon-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned\nrepresentations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs\nsignificantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models.

By\ndeploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key\nsemantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut\nlatency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel\ninterference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene\nreconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction\nrendering modules, all for immersive services.

Yet, despite recent advances,\ntheir output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains\ndifficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,\ndemonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the\ncoreutils and util-linux projects.

This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large\nLanguage Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based\nfuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over\nfuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels\nthe synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.\nCompared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of\nreal-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)\nsynthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and\nsemantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared\nELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized\nby state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more\ncoverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also\nused ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of\ncvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are\nexploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the\nfuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to\n62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers\nsynthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical\nstructures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way.

However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as\nfederated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such\nas horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed\nstructures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),\na novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data\npartitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In\nDC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations\ninstead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative\nclustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral\nclustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication\nwith the central server.

To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a\nPyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine\nlearning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior\nwork focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned\noptimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks.

The framework is\nbuilt on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,\ngoverned by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.\n  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model\nthat predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent\nstrain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby\novercoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN)-based models.

By modeling\nstress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed\ninput-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations\nand exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular\nsampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate\nHANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive\nanisotropic damage in brittle solids.

Furthermore, we\nuse sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the\napproach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify\nthe rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers\n(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural\nlanguage processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTreeLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTreeLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u9010\u5c42\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0b\u9650\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

When program judgments are distilled into a\nmodel, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of\nRewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the\nJudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u65b9\u6848PAJAMA\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8API\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PAJAMA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "PAJAMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

The method approximates the\nposterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses\nthis to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for\nexponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the\nmethod is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing\nbaselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion\nmodels, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the\nlatent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We\ndemonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within\nindividual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the\ndiffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the\nlatent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of\ndiffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase\ntransitions.

Accepted for publication at ECML-PKDD\n  2025", "summary": "Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question\nof learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown\ndisturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on\nachieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established\ntechniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints\npenalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained\nRL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable\nactions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.\nFurthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through\npenalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely\nby an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This\nreformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving\nresilience to disturbances.

In this paper,\nwe introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based\nfoundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the\nconstruction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal\nmodels (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the\nvalidity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior\ndistributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable\nCausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including\nback-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we\ninstantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating\nconditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention.

Our\nmethod, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically\nincorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing\nline-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable\nsolutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search\nto sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract\nexecution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and\nfinally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By\nmaintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and\nrefreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance\nwhile preserving syntactic structure.

However, conventional\napproaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and\nhistorical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different\ncontexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on\nvision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban\nstreetscape style differences.

Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u97f3\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u67b6\u6784\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u670910% - 60%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5411\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u97f3\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u67b6\u6784\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u4f5c\u539f\u5219\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5728560\u4e07\u97f3\u9891 - \u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u5ef6\u8fdf\u97f3\u9891\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u5c31\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6837\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e92\u8865\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u67b6\u6784\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u670910% - 60%\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u97f3\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number\nof successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with\nan arbitrarily long sequence of gusts.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve\nthe synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera\npositions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the\nObjaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.\nThe source code for TexTailor is available at\nhttps://github.com/Adios42/Textailor", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTexTailor\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u6e10\u53d8\u3001\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u6574\u5408\u5148\u524d\u5408\u6210\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Objaverse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u548cShapeNet\u6c7d\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTexTailor\u5728\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7eb9\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TexTailor\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn\nextremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,\nwhere both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.\n  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual\nInterpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for\nimage recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures\nlong-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable\nprototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.\nAdditionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution\ninput processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across\nscales.\n  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four\ndatasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.\nMoreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the\nlearned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant.

Method is based\nonly on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio\nwave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating\nthe quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data\nobtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for\neach radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the\nclassification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave\npropagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the\nradar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made\nusing meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal\nnumber of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed.

To address these challenges, we propose\nVision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for\nlocalization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity\ncommands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular\ncamera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a\nlarge language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into\nstructured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)\nthat matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a\nwaypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV\ncontrol. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without\nadditional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines.

The code is available at\n  https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer", "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges\nin addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data\nsimultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts.

Unlike previous removal attacks, which\nrely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only\nrequires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the\ntarget diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By\nleveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the\nmodel's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based\nattacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction\nin the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to\n0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image\nquality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full\naccess to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing\npublic autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by\ncurrent industry practices.

Traditional\nMonte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow\nconvergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the\ndimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we\nadopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity\nsolutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve\nsampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate\nmodels based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).\nThese deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical\nproperties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and\nasymptotic limits.

Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss\nwhich use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text\noffset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is\nsimilar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of\nwords is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the\noffset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment.

The\nchallenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only\ndetect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,\nleaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of\nseemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be\ninjected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.\nTo defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring\nframework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully\nprompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,\nbeating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor.

In this paper, we go beyond attention or\nsimilarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,\nwhich maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset.

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,\nwe tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with\nsemi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features\nare (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to\ntheir activating inputs, making them directly interpretable.

As such, it offers capabilities to gain\ninsights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in\nsolid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b49\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u7535\u6c60SEI\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u6676\u76f8\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u9502\u8815\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236SEI\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u56fa\u6001\u7535\u6c60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7535\u6c60\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b49\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u539f\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SEI\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u6676\u76f8Li\u2082S\u2080.\u2087\u2082P\u2080.\u2081\u2084Cl\u2080.\u2081\u2084\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u9502\u8815\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u521b\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u56fa\u6001\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u8d28\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002"}}
