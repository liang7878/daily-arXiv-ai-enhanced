However, in real-world\napplications such as school choice and residency matching, preferences are\nrevealed after capacity decisions are made, with matching occurring afterward;\nuncertainty about agents' preferences must be considered during capacity\nplanning. Moreover, even under strategy-proof mechanisms, agents may\nstrategically misreport preferences based on beliefs about admission chances.\nWe introduce a two-stage stochastic matching problem with uncertain\npreferences, using school choice as a case study. In the first stage, the\nclearinghouse expands schools' capacities before observing students' reported\npreferences. Students either report their true preferences, producing exogenous\nuncertainty, or act strategically, submitting reported preferences based on\ntheir true preferences and admission chances (which depend on capacities),\nintroducing endogenous uncertainty. In the second stage, the clearinghouse\ncomputes the student-optimal stable matching based on schools' priorities and\nstudents' reported preferences. In strategic cases, endogenous reported\npreferences are utility-maximizing transformations of capacity decisions and\nexogenous true preferences; we handle uncertainty using sample average\napproximation(SAA). We develop behavior-based mathematical formulations and,\ndue to problem complexity, propose Lagrangian- and local-search-based\nbehavior-specific heuristics for near-optimal solutions. Our SAA-based\napproaches outperform the average scenario approach on students' matching\npreferences and admission outcomes, emphasizing the impact of stochastic\npreferences on capacity decisions.

Existing learning-based approaches often rely on\ndiscretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to\ninefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes\nto prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can\nbe equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The\ncore idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial\nGroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally\napproximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we\ndevelop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous\nsampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order\noptimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees\ntruthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental\nevaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves\nstrong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.\n  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without\noutcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency.

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

Our methodology\nidentifies the Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) with the highest linear\ncorrelation to the power consumption of each hardware sub-system, for each\nDynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) state. The individual, simple\nmodels are composed into a complete model that effectively describes the power\nconsumption of the whole system, achieving high accuracy and low overhead. Our\nevaluation reports an average estimation error of 7.5% for power consumption\nand 1.3% for energy. We integrate these models in the Linux kernel with\nRunmeter, an open-source, PMC-based monitoring framework. Runmeter manages PMC\nsampling and processing, enabling the execution of our power models at runtime.\nWith a worst-case time overhead of only 0.7%, Runmeter provides responsive and\naccurate power measurements directly in the kernel.

The EWPM\nproblem is famous, since in the case of unary encoded weights, Mulmuley,\nVazirani, and Vazirani showed almost 40 years ago that the problem can be\nsolved in randomized polynomial time. However, up to this date no\nderandomization is known.\n  Our first result is a simple deterministic algorithm for EWPM that runs in\ntime $n^{O(\\ell)}$, where $\\ell$ is the number of distinct weights that perfect\nmatchings in $G$ can take. In fact, we show how to find an $\\ell$-th smallest\nperfect matching in any weighted graph (even if the weights are encoded in\nbinary, in which case EWPM in general is known to be NP-complete) in time\n$n^{O(\\ell)}$ for any integer $\\ell$. Similar next-to-optimal variants have\nalso been studied recently for the shortest path problem.\n  For our second result, we extend the list of problems that are known to be\nequivalent to EWPM. We show that EWPM is equivalent under a weight-preserving\nreduction to the Exact Cycle Sum problem (ECS) in undirected graphs with a\nconservative (i.e. no negative cycles) weight function. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to study this problem. As a consequence, the latter\nproblem is contained in RP if the weights are encoded in unary. Finally, we\nidentify a special case of EWPM, called BCPM, which was recently studied by El\nMaalouly, Steiner and Wulf. We show that BCPM is equivalent under a\nweight-preserving transformation to another problem recently studied by\nSchlotter and Seb\\H{o} as well as Geelen and Kapadia: the Shortest Odd Cycle\nproblem (SOC) in undirected graphs with conservative weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To\ndemonstrate adaptability, the paper includes sensitivity analysis for\nthree-point landings affected by added payload and touchdown speed, and\nrobustness analysis for one- and two-point landings under emergency wind\nconditions. The dynamic flight equations of an Airbus A320-200 during landing\nare derived and solved numerically. Results show that the active shock absorber\nsystem, optimized via two bee-based algorithms, outperforms the passive system\nin reducing bounce and pitch displacements and momenta, suspension travel, and\nimpact force in both time and frequency domains. This leads to significantly\nimproved passenger comfort and potentially longer structural fatigue life,\ndemonstrating industrial applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u8702\u7fa4\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8d77\u843d\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u51cf\u9707\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5f39\u8df3\u3001\u4fef\u4ef0\u4f4d\u79fb\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u88ab\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u75b2\u52b3\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d77\u843d\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7740\u9646\u548c\u8dd1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u8702\u7fa4\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6db2\u538b\u6267\u884c\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u51cf\u9707\u5668\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u7a7a\u5ba2A320 - 200\u7740\u9646\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u4e24\u79cd\u8702\u7fa4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u51cf\u9707\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u88ab\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5f39\u8df3\u548c\u4fef\u4ef0\u4f4d\u79fb\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u3001\u60ac\u67b6\u884c\u7a0b\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u51cf\u9707\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e58\u5ba2\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u7ed3\u6784\u75b2\u52b3\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

PCLV offers a\nstrategic tool for managers to strengthen competitiveness by leveraging OB data\nand boost profitability by driving marketing efforts at the individual customer\nlevel to increase the Actual CLV.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165PCLV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u5ba2\u6237\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLV\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u5b9e\u4f53\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5ba2\u6237\u6d3b\u52a8\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u9700\u5168\u9762\u4f30\u7b97\u5ba2\u6237\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PCLV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7559\u5b58\u6982\u7387\u548c\u4f30\u7b97\u6f5c\u5728\u8d21\u732e\u8fb9\u9645\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97PCLV\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u7b97\u5404\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684PCLV\uff0c\u8f83\u5b9e\u9645CLV\u670921.06%\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PCLV\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u8425\u9500\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645CLV\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6218\u7565\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based\nprompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler\ninstrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with\nstructured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the\nreliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the\nretrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline\nprompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,\nGPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world\nC++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.\nP4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the\nbaseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on\nnon-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to\nfundamental OpenMP limitations.

Evaluated\non 79 stencil kernels spanning diverse scientific domains, SparStencil achieves\nup to 7.1x speedup (3.1x on average) over state-of-the-art framework while\nreducing code complexity and matching or exceeding expert-tuned performance in\nboth compute throughput and memory efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSparStencil\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u7a00\u758fTCU\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u572879\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u5185\u6838\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5728AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f7f\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Adaptive Layout Morphing\u3001Structured Sparsity Conversion\u3001Automatic Kernel Generation\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u572879\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u5185\u6838\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe7.1\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u5e73\u57473.1\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SparStencil\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u7a00\u758fTCU\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u677f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the\ncore storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS.

Second, we aim to support\npredicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest\nneighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary\nsubset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS.

This study seeks to establish the\ngroundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized\nsearch heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel\nin treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by\napplying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while\npersistently using the $\\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay\nfoundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\\ell_1$-norm, accounting for\nthe suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify\ncorrelations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for\nunbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate\ndiscrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which\nwe show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down\nto the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We\nexplore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose\na procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our\ninvestigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which\nconsistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for\nunbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical\nevidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other\nstrategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the\nreplacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified\nand practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the\n$\\ell_1$-norm over the $\\ell_2$-norm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive\ninformation is critical for systems' compliance with security standards.\nAlthough holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing\ndatabase systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting\nin prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to\nimplement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without\ndisrupting critical operations.\n  To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online\ndatabase encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for\ndowntime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this\nvision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed\nnext, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this\nsolution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep\nlearning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the\ndatabase system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset\nfrom TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training\nand evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and\nLSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock\npredictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive\nBaseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.\n  The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based\nmodels achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for\npage-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline.

Compared to\nclassic periodic truss-, beam- and plate-based lattice architectures,\nspinodoids are insensitive to manufacturing defects, scalable for high\nthroughput production, functionally graded by tunable local properties, and\nmaterial failure resistant due to low-curvature morphology. However, the design\nof spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely\nlarge design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation,\ncontinuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while\ngenetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity,\ngradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate\nmathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid\nparameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale\ntopology optimization framework.

Additionally, it incorporates a\nGaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the\nneed for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of\nmultiscale topology optimization. Compared to 'black-box' deep learning\napproaches, the proposed framework provides clear physical insights into\nmaterial distribution.

Our findings challenge conventional\nwisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our\nadversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,\nour noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation\ngenerally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest\nthat quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually\nenhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights\nfor developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d51.59%\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,\nfulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and\nconsistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process\ndemonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer\nshortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers.

However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings.

However, current\nDGF tools are constrained by insufficient runtime feedback, limiting their\nefficiency in reaching targets and exploring state spaces. This study presents\nHF-DGF, a novel directed grey-box fuzzing framework. Its seed scheduling is\nguided by a hybrid feedback mechanism integrating control-flow distance,\nvalue-flow influence score, and slice coverage. To enable precise control-flow\ndistance feedback, we propose a backward-stepping algorithm to calculate basic\nblock-level seed distances on a virtual inter-procedural control-flow graph\n(ICFG). For effective state space exploration, we introduce value-flow\ninfluence and a corresponding metric, the value-flow influence score.\nAdditionally, to mitigate runtime overhead from hybrid feedback, we adopt a\nnovel selective instrumentation strategy.

This paper presents a test environment that combines a\nVehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and\nvehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian\nlocalization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach\nthrough a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations\nof VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a\ncommercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is\ngenerated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and\nprojected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation\ntechnique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle\nperception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP\ndomains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in\nmovement trajectories and joint estimation stability.

Among these, Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) approaches have\nshown great promise. Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs\ncan achieve leading results.

In this paper, we\npropose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for\nrepair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug\nfixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to\nretrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM\nin root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context.\nDuring the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific\nbugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with\nsimilar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to\nguide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the\nlikelihood of generating correct patches. Evaluations on two popular benchmarks\n(Defects4J V1.2 and V2.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over\nSOTA baselines.

The spanner problem\nasks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via\nsufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative\nalpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and\nassuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic\nby Alth\\\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory\nand practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent\napproximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so\nfar, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner\nproblem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple\napproximations algorithms. In general, our Adapted Greedy achieves the first\nunconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the\nindependence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and\nweight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned\nmultiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners.\nFurther, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight\nguarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph\ntransformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard\nmulticommodity flow LP.

In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning.

These escalating trends underscore the urgent\nneed for effective approaches that can automatically detect and understand\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Objective: However, the scarcity of labeled samples\nand the class imbalance issue in vulnerability datasets present significant\nchallenges for both Vulnerability Type Prediction (VTP) and Line-level\nVulnerability Detection (LVD), especially for rare yet critical vulnerability\ntypes. Moreover, most existing studies treat VTP and LVD as independent tasks,\noverlooking their inherent correlation, which limits the potential to leverage\nshared semantic patterns across tasks. Methods: To address these limitations,\nwe propose a unified approach that integrates Embedding-Layer Driven\nAdversarial Training (EDAT) with Multi-task Learning (MTL). Specifically, EDAT\nenhances model robustness by introducing adversarial perturbations to\nidentifier embeddings, guided by semantic importance. Meanwhile, MTL improves\noverall performance by leveraging shared representations and inter-task\ncorrelations between VTP and LVD. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both VTP\nand LVD tasks. For VTP, it yields notable improvements in accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying rare vulnerability types.\nSimilarly, for LVD, our approach enhances line-level detection accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing false positives. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that\ncombining EDAT with MTL provides a unified solution that improves performance\non both tasks and warrants further investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9488\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408EDAT\u548cMTL\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VTP\u548cLVD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5a01\u80c1\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709VTP\u548cLVD\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u5c11\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408Embedding - Layer Driven Adversarial Training (EDAT)\u4e0eMulti - task Learning (MTL)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VTP\u548cLVD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728VTP\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728LVD\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408EDAT\u548cMTL\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated significant capabilities in automatic code generation across a\nwide range of programming languages, including C++. Despite their impressive\nperformance, code generated by LLMs in safety-critical domains must be\ncarefully analyzed for conformance to MISRA C++ coding standards.

Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up\nto 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no\ncritical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires\nspecialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning\ntasks do not.

However,\ntraditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge\ngraphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or\nover-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring\nedges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\n\\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this\nstrategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its\nincident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most\npertinent ones.

Each worker\nrequires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the\ncommunication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the\nserver are $\\tau_{s}$ and $\\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One\nof the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability\nwith respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed\nversion of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\\frac{h \\sigma^2 L\n\\Delta}{n \\varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where\n$\\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \\in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,\nusing unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the\nvariance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term.

However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is\nwidely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised\nmodels are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,\nmasked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the\npotential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens\noffers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful\nproperties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform\nunexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,\nhigh-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention\nmaps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different\nmusical dimensions.

Persistent challenges include verifying semantic\ncorrectness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and\nlowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine\nlightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and\ncost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf92022\u5e741\u6708\u81f32025\u5e746\u6708\u53d1\u5e03\u768463\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u68b3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u90e8\u7f72\u5feb\u4f46\u53d7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u53cd\u9988\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u9760\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u3002"}}

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

A central\nchallenge for analyzing ULD is that its degeneracy necessitates the development\nof new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. In this paper,\nwe give a new coupling-based framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical\ndiscretizations. First, in the continuous-time setting, we use this framework\nto establish new parabolic Harnack inequalities for ULD. These are the first\nHarnack inequalities that decay to zero in contractive settings, thereby\nreflecting the convergence properties of ULD in addition to just its regularity\nproperties.\n  Second, we build upon these Harnack inequalities to develop a local error\nframework for analyzing discretizations of ULD in KL divergence. This extends\nour framework in part III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate\ndiffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to\nsophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity.\nApplying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD\nestablishes (i) the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave\nsampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number), and (ii) the\nfirst $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total\nvariation error in dimension $d$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u6b20\u963b\u5c3c\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08ULD\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u503c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u629b\u7269\u54c8\u7eb3\u514b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5c40\u90e8\u8bef\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4e2d\u70b9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "ULD\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u9000\u5316\u6027\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u629b\u7269\u54c8\u7eb3\u514b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5efa\u7acb\u5c40\u90e8\u8bef\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8870\u51cf\u5230\u96f6\u7684\u54c8\u7eb3\u514b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff1b\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eULD\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e2d\u70b9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5f39\u9053\u52a0\u901f\u7ed3\u679c\u548cd\u7ef4\u91c7\u6837\u5230\u6052\u5b9a\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790ULD\u53ca\u5176\u6570\u503c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002"}}

By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug\ntypes show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while\nonly a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that\ndifferent bug types require different levels of contextual information for\neffective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that\nmore complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI\nbugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information.

Therefore, effective data recovery methods are\nessential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.\nwhile classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are\nincapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios\ninvolving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust\nTensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately\nmodeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is\noften constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the\nsuboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2\nnorm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective\nlow-rank representation tool.

Moreover, prior work has limited\nconsideration of the diversity in algorithm types and difficulty levels.\nObjective: In this study, we aim to evaluate and improve LLMs in solving\nreal-world competitive programming problems. Methods: We initially collect 117\nproblems from nine regional ICPC/CCPC contests held in 2024 and design four\nfiltering criteria to construct a curated benchmark consisting of 80 problems.\nLeveraging DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM, we evaluate its competitive program\ngeneration capabilities through the online judge (OJ) platforms, guided by a\ncarefully designed basic prompt.

To\nevaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures\nenvironmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during\nwell-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first\nanalyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation\nthrough personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of\nthese services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software\nenvironmental impact assessment.

Existing online repair solutions\nenforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into\nacceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based\nconstraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies.

Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for\niteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a\nuser-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes\nupdated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary\nof performance statistics from prior training rounds.

This\narchitecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless\ncompression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear\nmemory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to\nTransformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM\nfor anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the\nfirst anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM\narchitecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder\nprocesses input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is\ndevised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,\nthe decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the\nreconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded\ncounterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:\nMean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider\nlocal reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We\nevaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17\nreal-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.\nIn our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23\npopular anomaly detection baselines.

To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an\naverage bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in\nMSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,\nbenchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that\nfeature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and\ndemonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias\nattribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the\ncomputational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning\nalgorithms.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this\nproblem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U\ntransmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing\nthe difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted\nlow precision version. With extensive experiments on various model\narchitectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a\nlarge model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data\nsets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U\nconsistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and\nlatency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,\naggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising\nperformance.

To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET\n(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with\npartial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention\nmechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their\nimportance and missingness.

In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

The results highlight the presence of\nantifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,\ndemonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL\npolicy adaptability.

The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a\npromising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.\nHome-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable\nand durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup\npresents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which\ncomplicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from\nsingle-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI\ntechniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,\nincluding noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo\nrecordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG.

In this paper, we present\nSub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key\ninsight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated\nexpert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared\n$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$\ncomponents. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)\nAdaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via\nK-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)\nSubspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to\nderive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues\nfrequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert\nreconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse\nexperts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression\nfor further inference optimization.

The proposed framework is validated through\nexperiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,\nand contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.\nThe results demonstrate a 10\\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct\nresponses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language\nmodels can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a\nscalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a F1 \u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347 10%\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u771f\u503c\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5355\u53e5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u201c\u662f\u201d\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85 100 \u7ec4\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u7684 F1 \u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u5347 10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that\nrepresents the intrinsic structure within datasets.

Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing\nthese challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree\nbranch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical\nrelationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based\napproach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a\nhierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized\ndiffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves\nstability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative\ncapacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion\nprocess. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both\ngeneral-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods\nin terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool\nfor hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient\nmodeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream\nbiological tasks.

Our approach introduces novel evaluation\nparadigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI\nadaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.\nExperimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like\nbehaviors: 18.7\\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\\% reduction in\nloss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse\nscenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for\nunderstanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d4c\u535a\u5fc3\u7406\u7684\u5192\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARG\u6846\u67b6\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5192\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d4c\u535a\u5fc3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5192\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8ffd\u635f\u503e\u5411\u548c\u6982\u7387\u8bef\u5224\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRARG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u6821\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u635f\u5931\u538c\u6076\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d4c\u535a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1118.7%\uff0c\u8ffd\u635f\u503e\u5411\u964d\u4f4e24.3%\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u98ce\u9669\u6821\u51c6\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8d4c\u535a\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based\nmethods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between\nvariables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation.

Such risks\nunderscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard\nindividual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements\nthat damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.\nTo address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale\nlanguage models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains\nchallenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,\nwe propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,\nwe introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context\nContrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform\nsupervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the\nworkflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those\ngenerating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for\nunifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference\nTransition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by\ndirectly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image\nquality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)\nAutoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition\nMatching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that\ngeneralize continuous AR methods.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).

However, transferring\nthis success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale\nbiomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and\nfragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models.

Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of\nthese steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study\naddresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder\ninput tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn\narithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture\nof target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign\norders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage.

By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a\nconvex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.\nWhile the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is\nlimited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized\nsubspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the\nglobal constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto\nlow-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training\nobjective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly\nimproved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u53caRS - LMI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728MNIST\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbLipschitz\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\u5b9e\u65bd\u5168\u5c40Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316NN\u5f97\u5230\u51f8\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1RS - LMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5c42\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001CIFAR - 10\u548cImageNet\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Lipschitz\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We establish an $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where\n$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode\nlength, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a\nlogarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the\noptimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance\ncompared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and\nBayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views.

We explore\nthe sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h\nPangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a\nspecific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)\nmethod does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth\nwithin a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast\nmodel to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly\nbased on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each\niteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are\nexpected to turn into directions of growing errors.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments\non side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds\ncompared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested\non natural images.

While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness\nwhich refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and\nconstraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify\nand adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this\npaper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and\npresent the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.\nWe examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,\nlinguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably\nidentify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT\nand Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case\nstudies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration\nthrough prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety\nvulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak\nsusceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of\nidentity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further\nunderstanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent\ndeployments.

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect\nfundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow\ndynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as\ncoarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both\nconceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems\nlike the coupled climate system.

We\npropose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in\nembodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on\nrich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,\ncovering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework\nsupports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides\nmultimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person\nperspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person\nevaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records\nafter a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for\na more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the\nsubjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We\nconstructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective\nvideos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated\nmultiple-choice questions (three options).

For\nopen-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D\npoint clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with\nhigh-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D\ninstance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object\nlocalization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most\nlikely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing\nmethods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often\noverlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,\ntraditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and\ndo not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none\nof the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we\npropose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint\ntrajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce\nmetrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the\nsequential dimension of predictions.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties.

Experimental results\nfrom three cities demonstrate that $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms\nopen-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex\ncross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.\nSource codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bUrbanLLaVA\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u56db\u79cd\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u57ce\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5951\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57ce\u5e02\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u57ce\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUrbanLLaVA\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanLLaVA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u57ce\u5e02\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u57ce\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging\ntasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,\n(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)\nscene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that\nproduce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,\nwhere each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier\ncontext tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the\nexplanation of later tokens beyond their original information.

Our study successfully\nreproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and\ncounterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism\ncompetition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing\ninformation. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)\nand Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three\nsignificant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these\nfindings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head\nspecialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by\nintroducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement\nverbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the\nlogit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the\nauthors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain\ncategories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction\ntoken as part of the subject of the sentence.

Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with\nspecific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their\ngeneralizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more\nchallenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate\nsets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user\ninstructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we\npropose $\\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user\ninstructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective\nevaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and\ngenerated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free\nframework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'\nin-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both\nimage-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive\nexperiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all\nexisting methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current\ngeneralized and even specialized approaches.

Experimental results show that incorporating\na suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to\n0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that\nexcessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the\nimportance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to\nenhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9002\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fc7\u91cf\u5219\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528FedAvg\u548cFedProx\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9002\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7fFedAvg\u5e73\u5747AUC\u4ece0.9206\u63d0\u5347\u52300.9237\uff0cFedProx\u4ece0.9429\u63d0\u5347\u52300.9538\uff0c\u8fc7\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, a quantitative and\nsystematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still\nlacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that\nfine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original\npre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,\nproviding a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a\nsimple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We\nintroduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned\nLLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we\nfind that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling\nthe fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on\nmodel outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination.

With this metric, our model can\neffectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer\nreal-time decisions.

First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per\nsubject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.\nAdditionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate\n(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,\np=5.85e-9).

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase\nthat MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.

However,\nmost existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity\nVision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across\nmodalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also\nlimits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the\nmodality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based\nFEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,\ncross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner.

Reliable empirical analysis of\nthe privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset\nconsisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the\ngeneral release of such data to the public.\n  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API\noutputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and\nprovide strong privacy protections.

We developed a\nmethodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches\nthe re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of\ndifferential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of\nprivate user information from this release.\n  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of\ndifferentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over\ntime. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces\nand optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.\nFinally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.\n  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset\nobtained by this methodology.

In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the\nprimary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does\nnot provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which\nprevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here\nwe focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving\nthe underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model\nparameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool\nto demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data\ndoes not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush\nmodel parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence\nof images.

However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective.

Therein, motion guidance is\nexplicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving\nbehaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state\nupdates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure\nmulti-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based\nhighway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly\nimproves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action\nconsistency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u77ed\u6216\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u4f4e\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u522b\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cHighD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u591a\u8f66\u9053\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6548\u7387\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
