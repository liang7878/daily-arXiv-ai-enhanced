The approximation error is measured\nwith respect to the corresponding undirected Laplacian. This notion is\nequivalent to direct Eulerian spectral approximation when the input graph is\nEulerian. Our algorithm achieves an amortized update time of\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2} \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ and produces a sparsifier of size\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2} n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$. Additionally, we present an\nalgorithm that maintains a constant-factor approximation sparsifier of size\n$O(n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ against an adaptive adversary for\n$O(\\text{polylog}(n))$-partially symmetrized graphs, a notion introduced in\n[Kyng-Meierhans-Probst Gutenberg '22]. A $\\beta$-partial symmetrization of a\ndirected graph $\\vec{G}$ is the union of $\\vec{G}$ and $\\beta \\cdot G$, where\n$G$ is the corresponding undirected graph of $\\vec{G}$.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem. The \"global\" step then utilizes the local one to find the\napproximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of\ncombinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted\nmatroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an\napproximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely\nalgorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract\nsettings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial\nfeasibility constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u5c40\u90e8 - \u5168\u5c40\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u59d4\u6258 - \u4ee3\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u5408\u540c\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u5c40\u90e8 - \u5168\u5c40\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u2018\u5c40\u90e8\u2019\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u8fb9\u5f3a\u5316\u7248\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u2018\u5168\u5c40\u2019\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u679c\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u5408\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u9884\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684 FPTAS \u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4e58\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u6027 FPTAS\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u7eaf\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The novelty of our approach\nlies in allowing not only the market parameters -- such as the interest rate,\nappreciation rate, volatility, and jump intensity -- to depend on the market\nregime, but also in permitting stock prices to experience jumps when the market\nregime switches, in addition to the usual micro-level jumps. This modeling\nchoice is motivated by empirical observations that stock prices often exhibit\nsharp declines when the market shifts from a ``bullish'' to a ``bearish''\nregime, and vice versa. By employing the completion-of-squares technique, we\nderive the optimal portfolio strategy and the efficient frontier, both of which\nare characterized by three systems of multi-dimensional ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). Among these, two systems are linear, while the first one is\nan $\\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, and highly nonlinear Riccati equation.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research\ndirections, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to\nenhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic\nmulti-agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u8d85\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u679044\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e38\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u8d85\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d644\u9879\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8d85\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6b3a\u9a97\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5b58\u5728HNF\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u5c11\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u8d85\u535a\u5f08\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u8d85\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6218\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This models\npractical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams.\nRecently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were\nintroduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one\ncan define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent\n$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip\nbetween their bundles that improves the value of $i$.\n  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is\ntwofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a\nstark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.\nFirst, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they\nfail to guarantee EFFX approximations.

We\nimplemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline\nsequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using\nOpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with\nshared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square\nmatrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096. Our results show\nthat while the parallel CPU provides a consistent speedup of 12-14x over the\nsequential version, the GPU's performance scales dramatically with problem\nsize. For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of\napproximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized\nparallel CPU version.

Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be\neffective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter\ntuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,\nintegration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has\nopened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced\nlanguage understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most\nexisting approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often\nneglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic\ndiversity in multi-objective settings.

Using daily stock data from the S&P 500 (2020-2024), we construct\ndependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance\nDecomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based\nnetwork. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to\nquantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty\ninformation we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By\napplying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core\ninter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A\ndynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital\nallocated based on Value at Risk (VaR).

In\nrecommendation settings, they can infer user preferences while countering\nexposure bias. In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,\nchoice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item.

Modern high performance\ncomputing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across\nnodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling\nand load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks\nsuch as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support\ndiverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling\nalgorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable\nalgorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.\n  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling\nalgorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across\nsix applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are\ncapable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require\nsignificant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.\nExpert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less\nexploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a\nspecific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based\nlearning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.\n  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling\nalgorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP\napplications.

Most previous models for such data\ndecompose logarithms of the response Poisson rates into fixed effects and\nspatial random effects, where the latter is typically assumed to follow a\nlatent Gaussian process, the conditional autoregressive model, or the intrinsic\nconditional autoregressive model. Since log-Gaussian is not conjugate to\nPoisson, such implementations must resort to either approximation methods like\nINLA or Metropolis moves on latent states in MCMC algorithms for model fitting\nand exhibit several approximation and posterior sampling challenges. Instead of\nmodeling logarithms of spatiotemporal frailties jointly as a Gaussian process,\nwe construct a spatiotemporal autoregressive gamma process guaranteed\nstationary across the time dimension.

In this paper, we quantify the macroeconomic effects of\nthree significant natural hazard-induced US power outages: Hurricane Ian\n(2022), the 2021 Texas Blackouts, and Tropical Storm Isaias (2020). Our\nanalysis evaluates the sensitivity of three commonly used data parameterization\ntechniques (household interruptions, kWh lost, and satellite luminosity), along\nwith three static models (Leontief and Ghosh, critical input, and inoperability\nInput-Output). We find the mean domestic loss estimates to be US $\\$3.13$ Bn,\nUS $\\$4.18$ Bn, and US $\\$2.93$ Bn, respectively. Additionally, data\nparameterization techniques can alter estimated losses by up to $23.1\\%$ and\n$50.5\\%$.

Additionally, we propose\nintegrating refactoring information to enhance six baseline approaches,\nresulting in overall improvements in recall and F1-score, with increases of up\nto 43.2% and 32.5%, respectively.

However, differences\nbetween structures will mean the training and testing distributions will\ndiffer; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to\ngeneralise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The\nMAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave\nconsistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with\ninvariance in the conditional distributions.

It is twice as likely\nfor an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to\nprovide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to\nbundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases\ncoincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave\nor health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than\nAI roles without this benefit.

Healthcare is one of such domains\nwhere KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge\naccuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics.

In fact, as of now there have been about only\n5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning\n(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,\ncapable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its\naccuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by\nlarge corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex\nalgorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in\nthis paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known\nML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models\nthat are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest\nneighbors, and random forest.

We propose a supervised\nfine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic\nreasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two\nstylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on\nindividual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of\nKantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).\nWe find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior\ntoward the corresponding economic agent.

As a\nresult, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an\nincreasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design\nschemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with\nGaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The\nauthors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting\nthorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple\nacquisition functions.

This paper addresses the\nshortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel\nheuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the\nvarious optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to\nregular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems.

As an engineering use case, the solder joint\nreliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep\nstrain under a cyclic thermal load.

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both\nproblems.

State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve\npromising performance with only a few labels from the target system.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''.

The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA.

Despite\ngrowing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,\nwith major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence\nproduction until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028.

(2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables).

Our study is among the first to\nexamine multi-CI adoption in practice, offering new insights for future\nresearch and highlighting the need for strategies and tools to support service\nselection, coordination, and migration in evolving CI environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u67902008\u5e741\u6708\u81f32024\u5e7412\u6708\u95f418924\u4e2aGitHub\u4e0aJava\u9879\u76ee\u5bf98\u79cdCI\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u591aCI\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u4e2aCI\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9879\u76ee\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3CI\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679018924\u4e2aGitHub\u4e0aJava\u9879\u76ee\u57282008\u5e741\u6708\u81f32024\u5e7412\u6708\u95f4\u5bf98\u79cdCI\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u670d\u52a1\u5171\u91c7\u7528\u6216\u66ff\u6362\u9891\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u4e00\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aCI\u670d\u52a1\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd1\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u9879\u76ee\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e38\u53cd\u6620CI\u670d\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u6700\u65e9\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8003\u5bdf\u591aCI\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u7684CI\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While recent advances leverage\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nmodels with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear\nacross diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically\ninvestigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code\npreferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we\nhypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore\nsuperior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions.

Among the two implementations, the one developed with CUDA graph\nenables higher efficiency.

Using an\nexample of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt\ncomponent (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first\ndescribes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on\nthat abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum\nsafety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their\ntargets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they\nmeet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment\nprocess.

We applied Interpretive Structure\nModeling (ISM) to explore the relationships between motivator categories,\nfollowed by MICMAC analysis to classify them by their driving and dependence\npower. Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to rank these motivators by importance. Twenty key\nmotivators were identified and grouped into eight categories: Human Resource,\nKnowledge Integration, Coordination, Project Administration, Standards,\nTechnology Factor, Stakeholders, and Strategy & Matrices. ISM results showed\nthat 'Human Resource' and 'Coordination' heavily influence other factors.\nMICMAC analysis placed categories like Human Resource (CA1), Coordination\n(CA3), Stakeholders (CA7), and Strategy & Matrices (CA8) in the independent\ncluster, indicating high driving but low dependence power. Fuzzy TOPSIS ranked\nmotivators such as promoting team diversity, establishing AI governance bodies,\nappointing oversight leaders, and ensuring data privacy as most critical. To\nsupport ethical AI adoption, organizations should align their strategies with\nthese motivators and integrate them into their policies, governance models, and\ndevelopment frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9053\u5fb7\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e8620\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c06\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u878d\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u867d\u5e26\u6765\u53d8\u9769\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9053\u5fb7\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdb\u884cMICMAC\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u6a21\u7ccaTOPSIS\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u6309\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a20\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u5206\u4e3a\u516b\u7c7b\uff0cISM\u663e\u793a\u201c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u201d\u548c\u201c\u534f\u8c03\u201d\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0cMICMAC\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\u5f52\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u6a21\u7ccaTOPSIS\u7ed9\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u6392\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e94\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6fc0\u52b1\u56e0\u7d20\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9053\u5fb7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)\ndetection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited\nattention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.\nThis work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to\npredict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time\nefficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for\npattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first\nAI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the\naccuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.\nWe particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,\nrespectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear\npattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern\ndeminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the\nBayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a\nBayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,\nRestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing\npattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the\naverage share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time\nthan the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear\nand curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,\nsuggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk\nprediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdRestoreAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5730\u96f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u96f7\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u6392\u96f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u96f7\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7528AI\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u96f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u96f7\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RestoreAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u6392\u96f7\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5229\u7528PCA\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4e3b\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u66f2\u7ebf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "RestoreAI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u96f7\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u6392\u96f7\u5668\u6bcf\u6b65\u6e05\u9664\u5730\u96f7\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63d0\u9ad814.37\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6240\u6709\u5730\u96f7\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u6392\u96f7\u5668\u5c1124.45%\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u66f2\u7ebf\u6392\u96f7\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RestoreAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Previous studies\nreported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source\ndevelopment. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.\nThe state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing\npast migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent\nconfigurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises\nconcerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using\nrule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,\nsuggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability\nof CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which\nwe aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,\nwe propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI\nconfigurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to\nCIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of\nLLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of\nalready established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback\non the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate\nresearch questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus\nground truth and the output of CIMig.

Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information.

We show that these models can capture\nharmonic flows, incorporate boundary conditions, and model non-stationary data.\nFinally, we apply these models to downscaling stationary and non-stationary\ngridded wind data on the globe, and to inference of ocean currents from sparse\nobservations in bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u89d2\u7f51\u683c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u56fa\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u98ce\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u6d0b\u6d41\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73af\u5883\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u6570\u636e\u5e95\u5c42\u573a\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u4f46\u89c2\u6d4b\u79bb\u6563\uff0c\u9700\u5408\u9002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u5e76\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u5f00\u53d1\u79bb\u6563\u56fa\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8c10\u6ce2\u6d41\u3001\u7eb3\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u98ce\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u754c\u533a\u57df\u6d77\u6d0b\u6d0b\u6d41\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Despite advances\nin language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs\nperform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for\nagents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times.

While\nnumerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either\nby maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),\npractical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone.

Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly\npass code review and be integrated into the software product.\n  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific\ntests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation.

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts.

As libraries evolve, they may break the\ntacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral\nbreaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client\napplications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression\ntests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited\nlibrary coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the\nlibrary's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach\nto client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests\nin a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose\nrecording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of\nclient tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These\nsequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact\ncontract expected by a client at a specific point in time.

To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive\nfuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional\narchitecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding\nwindow to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction\nstrategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short\nand long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to\nautomatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships\namong them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require\nhuman involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce\ncalculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global\ncharacteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing\nredundant information.

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data\ndue to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly\ndeployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and\nprivacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph\nstructures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first\nsystematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against\nnode classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client\naims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior\ncentralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in\ntraining, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained\nprivacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework\nthat exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding\nproximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We\nevaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.\nResults show that our method achieves high performance on both membership\ninference and ownership identification.

We then propose a straightforward method\nto induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing\nthe effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.\nWe show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves\ngeneralization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting\nneural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u8303\u6570\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff09\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u987f\u609f\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u90fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fc3\u8fdb\u987f\u609f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

Experimental methods for DBP\nidentification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient\ncomputational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder\nwith a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly\nfrom raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions\nwithin residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich\nsequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture\nhierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We\nconducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings\nfrom ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that\nProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large\ndatasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller\ndatasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive\nevaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It\nachieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task\nfunctions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with\nhighly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of\ntransformers for unseen functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76transformer\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aLipschitz\u5e38\u6570\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\u523b\u753b\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u9000\u5316L - Lipschitz\u4efb\u52a1\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9aLipschitz\u5e38\u6570L\u662f\u63a7\u5236transformer\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9L\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd1\u96f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee4\u724c\u5728\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u4f1a\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86transformers\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However,\nacquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,\nmaking Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active\nLearning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques\nlike \"clique expansion,\" which destroys the high-order structural information\ncrucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a\nnative active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs.

Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,\nthough reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.\nMPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening\nstrategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the\nmerging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential\nstructural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive\nlearning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and\ncluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature\nmasking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during\nmulti-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL\ndivergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures\ncross-scale consistency of node representations.

Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for\ncolor image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular\nValue Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1\nquaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural\nnetworks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The\nnetwork training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data\nusually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse\nbut more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation\ndata to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step\ninvolves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic\nerrors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of\nthe entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer\nperceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established\nmethod based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical\nsolutions near nonlinearities.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that\nuses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries\nbetween music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints\nimposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports\nstyle-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical\ngenres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to\nhandle any reference individual at any resolution.

First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively.

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,\nmost existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise\nallocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different\nresponse demands. Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes\ntwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and\nSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that\ndifferent \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for\ntasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step\nlogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework\nthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using\nfewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task\ndata via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on\nimportance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training\nSystem 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and\nintuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to\nreinforce deeper logical deliberation next.

To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical\nstructures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated\nlogical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used\nSPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)\nCollaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.\n  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data\nproperties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To\nstandardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive\ndefinitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully\nvalidated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,\nfor instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours\ndue to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.\n  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,\nincluding ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,\nand outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the\nability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy\nrecommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,\nintegration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.\n  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and\ndemonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient\nscenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6025\u6027\u62a4\u7406\u7684NIRS\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u547c\u5438\u652f\u6301\uff08NIRS\uff09\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6025\u6027\u62a4\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Web\u672c\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\uff08OWL\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u548cProtege\u5f00\u53d1NIRS\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0SWRL\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u752817\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u60a3\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7528SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u4f53\u6709132\u4e2a\u7c7b\u300112\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\u548c17\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c882\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0350\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0cSPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06NIRS\u6982\u5ff5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u672c\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u60a3\u8005\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, MI-EEG\ndecoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and\nlimited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new\nusers. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods\nindiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the\nlarge inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative\ntransfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches\nfocus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit\ndependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability\nto preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a\nnovel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model\n(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant\nsources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)\nand Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and\ndecision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class\ndiscriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

Deep learning integration into\nstructural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge\nproblems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review\nexamines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated\nparticle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,\nCryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias\n(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In\ncryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous\nmissing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines\nsubtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow\nculminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like\nModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into\ninterpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved\nnear-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,\nresolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation\nbias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV\nvirus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes.

Despite the threats to voice privacy,\nresearch to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual\nvoices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,\nwe address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.\nTo meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for\nZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the\nmodel forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to\ngenerate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate\nrandomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,\nassuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a\nnew evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF).

However, existing\napproaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective\nhybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetworks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for\nefficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built\non two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and\naverage neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions\nto extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate\nneighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression\nproblem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate\nground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic\nnetworks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world\nnetworks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve\nreal world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms\ntraditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking\naccuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an\naverage improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard\nSimilarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves\nan average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank\ndistributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.\nFurthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly\nreasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning\nmethods, making it suitable for large scale applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b1D - CGS\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8282\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa1D - CGS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u54081D - CNN\u901f\u5ea6\u548cGraphSAGE\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u90bb\u5c45\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528SIR\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c1D - CGS\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0cKendall's Tau\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad84.73%\uff0cJaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad87.67%\uff0c\u5355\u8c03\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u57470.99\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "1D - CGS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Empirical\nevidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training\nexamples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the\nquantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data\nfiltration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality\nimage-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters\npotential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.\nUnlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on\ntop of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent\nevaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM.

Our lightweight model\nefficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text\nalignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that\ndatasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on\npar with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through\nhigh-volume web crawling.

The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then\nincorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such\nas gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical\nfidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent\nchannel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior\nperformance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This\nhybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems\nusing near-term quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4f46\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8defBorn\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u53d8\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u91cf\u5b50\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in\n\\cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization)\nalgorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper,\nwe aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the\nchallenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious\nstationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the\nDFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve\nthe constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we\nrevisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish\nits convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When\nthese assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative\napproaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation\nmethods.

Most existing work\nfocuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have\nexplored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts\nare restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and\nlack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration.

However, practical constraints such as\nlimited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in\nsparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we\nrevisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA\nradio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into\nthe DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed\nband-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training\ndata, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical\nabsorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is\ndesigned to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model\nwas evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom\nand in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed\ntraining mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the\ndifferent tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the\nspatiotemporal bandwidth.

It generates images by\nprogressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the\ncomputational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge\ndue to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce\nSparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction\nthat dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without\nrequiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation\nthat tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality\nin high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring\ntokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale\nprediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on\nhigh-frequency areas.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nsynthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual\ndescriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,\nconverting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.\nWe validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal\nsounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.\nExperimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty\nacross machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding\nsupports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed\nLLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6b63\u5e38\u673a\u5668\u58f0\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5b57\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f02\u5e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u5f02\u5e38\u793a\u4f8b\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8bfb\u6545\u969c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u97f3\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u5e38\u673a\u5668\u58f0\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u6b63\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u58f0\u97f3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions.

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels.

We examine how different aspects of the\nfine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,\nusing the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.\n  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to\ndetect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess\nverbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u9010\u5b57\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u9002\u914d\u3001\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u4e2d\u79e9\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u503c\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u77e9\u9635\u6bd4\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d21\u732e\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f83\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u66f4\u591a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u79e9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u79e9\u65f6\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}
