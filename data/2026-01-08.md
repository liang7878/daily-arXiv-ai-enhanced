### [1] [Mastering the Game of Go with Self-play Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03306)
*Jingbin Liu,Xuechun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍QZero模型，一种无模型强化学习算法，无需人类数据与训练搜索，用有限计算资源达到与AlphaGo相当水平，首次证明无模型强化学习掌握围棋的效率和离线策略强化学习解决复杂环境的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往围棋人工智能方法多依赖基于模型的蒙特卡罗树搜索，本文提出新的无模型强化学习算法QZero。

Method: 采用基于熵正则化的Q学习，利用单个Q值网络统一策略评估和改进，通过自我对弈和离线策略经验回放学习纳什均衡策略。

Result: QZero在仅使用7个GPU训练5个月且无人类数据输入的情况下，达到与AlphaGo相当的性能。

Conclusion: 首次证明无模型强化学习可有效掌握围棋，离线策略强化学习可用于解决大规模复杂环境问题。

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

### [2] [Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335)
*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究Digital Red Queen算法，用LLM在Core War游戏中进化程序，发现战士程序变得更通用且行为多样性降低，凸显动态目标价值，表明该算法可用于多智能体对抗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数LLM进化框架将问题视为静态优化问题，忽略现实世界进化过程中的开放式对抗动态，因此研究能包含“红皇后”动态的算法。

Method: 使用DRQ自博弈算法，利用LLM在Core War游戏中进化战士程序，每一轮让模型进化新战士击败之前所有战士。

Result: 战士程序变得更通用，不同独立运行间行为多样性减少，表明存在向通用行为策略收敛的压力。

Conclusion: 从静态目标转向动态红皇后目标有潜在价值，Core War可作为研究人工系统对抗适应和评估LLM进化方法的沙盒，类似的自博弈方法可用于更多实际多智能体对抗领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

*Alberto Purpura,Li Wang,Sahil Badyal,Eugenio Beaufrand,Adam Faulkner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 传统提示优化方法有局限，提出多智能体工作流优化提示，评估显示能提升模型输出合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型输出常符合内容但不符合形式约束，传统提示优化方法忽略细粒度约束。

Method: 提出多智能体工作流，将主要任务描述和约束优化分离，用定量分数反馈迭代重写和改进。

Result: 该方法生成的修订提示使Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral - 8x 7B等模型的合规性得分显著提高。

Conclusion: 所提出的多智能体工作流能有效提升大语言模型输出的合规性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人工智能中的心智理论，探索自我和他人意识的统一系统，研究自我意识对代理学习能力的影响。

Method: 让强化学习代理在网格世界中推断自身内部状态，引入受生物疼痛启发的内省探索组件，利用隐马尔可夫模型从在线观察中推断“疼痛信念”并集成到主观奖励函数中，还比较正常和慢性疼痛感知模型的性能。

Result: 内省代理总体上显著优于标准基线代理，能复制复杂的类人行为。

Conclusion: 内省探索组件有助于提升代理学习能力，在模拟复杂人类行为上有优势。

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开放式具身环境中智能体构建、完善和重用可执行技能库的问题。

Method: 引入Programmatic Skill Network (PSN)框架，通过大语言模型实例化三个核心机制，且PSN学习动态与神经网络训练有结构上的相似性。

Result: 在MineDojo和Crafter的实验中展示出强大的技能重用、快速适应以及跨开放式任务分布的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PSN框架在开放式具身环境的持续技能获取方面有良好表现。

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

Abstract: We propose a maturity-based framework for certifying embodied AI systems through explicit measurement mechanisms. We argue that certifiable embodied AI requires structured assessment frameworks, quantitative scoring mechanisms, and methods for navigating multi-objective trade-offs inherent in trustworthiness evaluation. We demonstrate this approach using uncertainty quantification as an exemplar measurement mechanism and illustrate feasibility through an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) detection case study.

### [7] [Variance Computation for Weighted Model Counting with Knowledge Compilation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03523)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际推理任务中模型参数有不确定性，想计算推理结果的不确定性程度，而计算该方差的易处理性未知，因此研究WMC方差计算问题及其易处理性。

Method: 先针对结构化d - DNNF推导计算WMC方差的多项式时间算法，再证明在结构化DNNF、d - DNNF和FBDD上该问题的难度，最后展示在贝叶斯网络推理中的应用。

Result: 得到结构化d - DNNF输入时计算WMC方差的多项式时间算法，证明了其他几种结构上问题的难度，算法能评估真实贝叶斯网络边际概率的方差，并分析参数方差对边际方差的影响。

Conclusion: 研究了WMC方差计算问题，在特定结构上有有效算法，可用于贝叶斯网络推理的不确定性度量。

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

### [8] [CPGPrompt: Translating Clinical Guidelines into LLM-Executable Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03475)
*Ruiqi Deng,Geoffrey Martin,Tony Wang,Gongbo Zhang,Yi Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yanshan Wang,Justin F Rousseau,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发并验证了CPGPrompt系统，将临床实践指南转化为大语言模型，在不同领域测试系统性能，不同任务和领域表现有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践指南整合到人工智能有挑战，以往方法存在局限性，需要新方法解决。

Method: 开发CPGPrompt系统，将CPGs转化为结构化决策树，用大语言模型动态导航进行患者病例评估，用合成病例测试系统。

Result: 二元专科转诊分类在各领域表现好，多类路径分配表现有差异，不同领域因指南结构不同性能不同。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt系统在临床实践指南转化中有应用潜力，但不同任务和领域性能受指南结构影响。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

### [9] [Personalization of Large Foundation Models for Health Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03482)
*Stefan Konigorski,Johannes E. Vedder,Babajide Alamu Owoyele,İbrahim Özkan*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 明确预测与因果的界限，解决矛盾张力对负责任地将AI融入个性化医疗至关重要。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

*Di Wu,Yanyan Zhao,Xin Lu,Mingzhe Li,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出STAR - S框架集成安全规则推理学习到自教循环中防御大语言模型越狱攻击，实验效果好。

Motivation: 确定有效防御越狱攻击的安全推理形式困难，需解决此问题以保障大语言模型安全部署。

Method: 提出STAR - S框架，在安全规则引导下进行推理和反思，利用微调增强安全推理，形成循环。

Result: STAR - S有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线。

Conclusion: STAR - S框架能有效应对大语言模型的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

TL;DR: 提出新的神经符号框架评估推理，分析多种因素影响，发现长token生成非深度推理必要条件，指出训练和蒸馏存在的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前思维链评估存在局限性，难以判断大语言模型性能提升源于推理还是冗长表述。

Method: 提出新颖的神经符号框架，进行非侵入式、全面的以过程为中心的推理评估；识别四种行为原型并诊断故障模式；研究推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现扩展token生成并非深度推理的必要条件；训练中混合长短CoT数据有过早饱和和崩溃风险；将知识蒸馏到较小模型时，能捕捉行为长度但无法复制逻辑效力。

Conclusion: 明确当前训练策略和模型蒸馏的局限性，为大语言模型复杂推理能力的评估和改进提供方向。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练可靠的工具增强代理存在挑战，现有基于大语言模型的评判器信号有噪声且不一致。

Result: SCRIBE在多个推理和工具使用基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，提升了模型准确率和多轮工具交互成功率。

Conclusion: SCRIBE在不同抽象层次有协同进化，且可与低级工具优化叠加，助力构建更可靠的工具使用代理。

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文利用稀疏自动编码器和SAE - Steering方法控制大推理模型的推理策略，效果优于现有方法，还能纠正推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大推理模型自主选择推理策略常产生低效或错误路径，且现有控制方法难以处理细粒度策略，需开发控制推理策略的方法。

Method: 利用稀疏自动编码器将策略纠缠的隐藏状态分解到解纠缠特征空间，提出SAE - Steering两阶段特征识别管道。

Result: SAE - Steering控制效果比现有方法高15%以上，控制推理策略使绝对准确率提高7%。

Conclusion: SAE - Steering方法在控制大推理模型推理策略上表现良好，能有效纠正推理路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

TL;DR: 直接将基于文本的思维链推理范式应用于蛋白质功能理解无效，提出工具增强的蛋白质推理代理PFUA，实验显示其性能优于仅文本推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本推理范式直接应用于蛋白质功能理解效果不佳，蛋白质功能预测是知识密集型任务，需外部生物先验和计算工具。

Method: 提出PFUA，统一问题分解、工具调用和可靠答案生成，整合特定领域工具产生可验证中间证据。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PFUA平均性能比仅文本推理模型提高103%。

Conclusion: PFUA在蛋白质功能预测中比直接应用文本推理范式更有效。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs显式思维步骤可能放大不安全行为，传统防御机制因忽略其推理动态而无效，需新防御方法。

Method: 提出SafeRemind解码时间防御方法，利用熵触发在决策锁定点干预，动态注入安全提醒短语。

Result: 在五个LRMs和六个基准上评估，SafeRemind大幅提升安全性，最高提高45.5%p，同时保留核心推理效用。

Conclusion: SafeRemind能有效提升LRMs安全性，且无需参数更新，保留推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain - of - Thought (CoT) 推理用于实时查询校正时延迟过高，早期答案独立于后续推理无法利用推理能力提升准确率。

Method: 提出SandwichR方法，遵循Answer - Reasoning - Answer范式；设计一致性感知强化学习策略；构建高质量查询校正数据集。

Result: SandwichR实现了与标准CoT相当的SOTA准确率，同时降低了40 - 70%的延迟。

Conclusion: SandwichR解决了在线搜索中的延迟 - 准确率权衡问题。

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往使用通用启发式的自动规划器在药物规划中只能考虑不超过七种药物，无法满足临床需求，需提升可扩展性。

Method: 通过编程指定领域，用大语言模型生成特定问题启发式，供固定搜索算法（GBFS）使用。

Result: 在覆盖范围和规划时间上有显著改进，可处理的药物数量至少提升到28种。

Conclusion: 该方法使药物规划更接近实际应用。

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Conclusion: EntroCoT框架能有效识别和改进低质量推理轨迹，构建的高质量数据集有助于提升大语言模型数学推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

Method: 将其形式化为OS-MCKP问题，提出两阶段的ROI-Reasoning框架，包括元认知微调与理性强化学习。

Result: 在预算数学推理基准上，提升整体分数，减少计算预算不足时的遗憾。

Conclusion: ROI-Reasoning框架能赋予大模型预算感知的理性，优化推理表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Result: ASP 方法符合 RC 的理论基础，且有更好的计算效率。

Conclusion: 使用 ASP 计算 RC 是可行且更有效的。

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Result: 开发出支持法律专家的工具，能生成新案例的可能决策和解释。

Conclusion: 该工具使司法决策过程更具可解释性，可从案例中归纳法律规则。

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

Method: 提出Trade - R1框架，将评估金融文档推理问题转化为结构化RAG任务，构建三角一致性度量，探索FSR和DSR两种奖励整合策略。

Result: 实验表明该范式减少了奖励破解，DSR实现了更好的跨市场泛化并保持最高推理一致性。

Conclusion: Trade - R1框架能有效解决强化学习在金融决策中的奖励破解问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决推理模型效率问题，实现效率和性能的提升。

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines.

Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

### [32] [SciNetBench: A Relation-Aware Benchmark for Scientific Literature Retrieval Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03260)
*Chenyang Shao,Yong Li,Fengli Xu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 本文提出首个用于文献检索代理的科学网络关系感知基准SciNetBench，评估三种级别的文献关系，发现当前检索范式存在不足，验证关系感知检索的重要性并公开基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索代理主要关注内容相似度，无法解码关键关系动态，导致知识结构碎片化等问题，需对关系感知检索进行更深入研究。

Method: 基于超1800万篇AI论文构建SciNetBench，系统评估三种级别的关系，对三类检索代理进行广泛评估，在文献综述任务上进行实验。

Result: 检索代理在关系感知检索任务上准确率常低于20%，为代理提供关系真值能使综述质量提升23.4%。

Conclusion: 关系感知检索至关重要，公开SciNetBench基准以支持未来高级检索系统研究。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI agent has spurred the development of advanced research tools, such as Deep Research. Achieving this require a nuanced understanding of the relations within scientific literature, surpasses the scope of keyword-based or embedding-based retrieval. Existing retrieval agents mainly focus on the content-level similarities and are unable to decode critical relational dynamics, such as identifying corroborating or conflicting studies or tracing technological lineages, all of which are essential for a comprehensive literature review. Consequently, this fundamental limitation often results in a fragmented knowledge structure, misleading sentiment interpretation, and inadequate modeling of collective scientific progress. To investigate relation-aware retrieval more deeply, we propose SciNetBench, the first Scientific Network Relation-aware Benchmark for literature retrieval agents. Constructed from a corpus of over 18 million AI papers, our benchmark systematically evaluates three levels of relations: ego-centric retrieval of papers with novel knowledge structures, pair-wise identification of scholarly relationships, and path-wise reconstruction of scientific evolutionary trajectories. Through extensive evaluation of three categories of retrieval agents, we find that their accuracy on relation-aware retrieval tasks often falls below 20%, revealing a core shortcoming of current retrieval paradigms. Notably, further experiments on the literature review tasks demonstrate that providing agents with relational ground truth leads to a substantial 23.4% performance improvement in the review quality, validating the critical importance of relation-aware retrieval. We publicly release our benchmark at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SciNetBench/ to support future research on advanced retrieval systems.

Result: 文中未明确提及，但从方法可推测能高效进行随机流体模拟及捕捉流体运动特征。

Conclusion: 文中未明确给出结论。

Abstract: We present PIVONet (Physically-Informed Variational ODE Neural Network), a unified framework that integrates Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neuro-ODEs) with Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) for stochastic fluid simulation and visualization. First, we demonstrate that a physically informed model, parameterized by CNF parameters θ, can be trained offline to yield an efficient surrogate simulator for a specific fluid system, eliminating the need to simulate the full dynamics explicitly. Second, by introducing a variational model with parameters φ that captures latent stochasticity in observed fluid trajectories, we model the network output as a variational distribution and optimize a pathwise Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), enabling stochastic ODE integration that captures turbulence and random fluctuations in fluid motion (advection-diffusion behaviors).

Result: 通过大语言模型用户模拟评估，系统能挖掘潜在意图、引导发现、生成适用文档，还可作为文档层捕捉机构知识。

Conclusion: Pneuma - Seeker系统能有效应对用户意图相关的数据管理难题。

Abstract: Data discovery and preparation remain persistent bottlenecks in the data management lifecycle, especially when user intent is vague, evolving, or difficult to operationalize. The Pneuma Project introduces Pneuma-Seeker, a system that helps users articulate and fulfill information needs through iterative interaction with a language model-powered platform. The system reifies the user's evolving information need as a relational data model and incrementally converges toward a usable document aligned with that intent. To achieve this, the system combines three architectural ideas: context specialization to reduce LLM burden across subtasks, a conductor-style planner to assemble dynamic execution plans, and a convergence mechanism based on shared state. The system integrates recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic frameworks, and structured data preparation to support semi-automatic, language-guided workflows. We evaluate the system through LLM-based user simulations and show that it helps surface latent intent, guide discovery, and produce fit-for-purpose documents. It also acts as an emergent documentation layer, capturing institutional knowledge and supporting organizational memory.

*Daniel Qian,Xiyu Hao,Jinkun Geng,Yuncheng Yao,Aurojit Panda,Jinyang Li,Anirudh Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出无领导的BFT协议Aspen，实现近最优延迟，去除无竞争条件，在实验中有性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采用无领导乐观快速路径的BFT共识协议快速路径有无竞争条件限制，为实现低延迟且去除此条件。

Method: 利用基于松散同步时钟和网络延迟估计的尽力而为排序层去除无竞争条件，使用n = 3f + 2p + 1个副本应对故障节点，乐观条件不满足时回退到PBFT协议。

Result: 在广域分布式副本实验中，Aspen的请求提交时间小于75毫秒，相比之前协议有1.2 - 3.3倍提升，每秒支持19000个请求。

Conclusion: Aspen能有效实现低延迟，去除无竞争条件限制，有较好性能表现。

Abstract: As Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols begin to be used in permissioned blockchains for user-facing applications such as payments, it is crucial that they provide low latency. In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.
  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.

TL;DR: 介绍了动态可用性的概念，指出其局限性，提出Ebb - and - flow协议解决问题，介绍了Majorum构造及其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态可用协议在网络分区或长时间异步时无法提供强安全保证的问题。

Method: 提出Majorum构造，其动态可用组件基于基于仲裁的协议（TOB - SVD）。

Result: 在乐观条件下，Majorum只需三个槽就能完成块的最终确定，每个槽仅需一个投票阶段。

Conclusion: 当条件有利时，每个槽能最终确定扩展前一个已确定块的下一个块。

Abstract: Dynamic availability is the ability of a consensus protocol to remain live despite honest participants going offline and later rejoining. A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.
  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one.

TL;DR: 本文针对MoE模型在基于边缘的GPU - NDP系统中部署面临的挑战，提出高效推理框架，实验表明该框架能显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽利于边缘部署，但显存大，需具备近数据处理（NDP）能力的GPU系统。而在边缘GPU - NDP系统部署时，面临负载不平衡、GPU利用率不足和数据预分析量大等问题。

Method: 提出一个高效推理框架，包括利用张量并行在多NDP单元同时计算专家参数、使用负载均衡调度算法分配计算任务、采用无数据集预取策略加载常用专家。

Result: 该框架使GPU - NDP系统的端到端延迟比现有方法平均提升2.41倍，最高达2.56倍。

Conclusion: 所提框架能在资源受限环境中显著增强MoE推理效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU共享技术在同时确保SLO遵守和最大化效率方面面临挑战，缺乏闭源GPU的细粒度任务调度。

Method: 提出Hummingbird系统，在闭源GPU上实现微秒级抢占并有效利用空闲GPU时间片。

Result: 与现有空间和时间共享方法相比，Hummingbird使高优先级任务的SLO达成率分别提高9.7倍和3.5倍；与单独执行相比，高优先级任务与低优先级任务在Hummingbird上共置时SLO达成率下降不到1%；低优先级任务吞吐量比现有时间共享方法高2.4倍。

Conclusion: Hummingbird在保障SLO的同时提高了GPU利用率，具有显著有效性。

Abstract: Existing GPU-sharing techniques, including spatial and temporal sharing, aim to improve utilization but face challenges in simultaneously ensuring SLO adherence and maximizing efficiency due to the lack of fine-grained task scheduling on closed-source GPUs. This paper presents Hummingbird, an SLO-oriented GPU scheduling system that overcomes these challenges by enabling microsecond-scale preemption on closed-source GPUs while effectively harvesting idle GPU time slices. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse GPU architectures reveal that Hummingbird improves the SLO attainment of high-priority tasks by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal-sharing approaches. When compared to executing exclusively, the SLO attainment of the high-priority task, collocating with low-priority tasks on Hummingbird, only drops by less than 1%. Meanwhile, the throughput of the low-priority task outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal-sharing approaches by 2.4x. Hummingbird demonstrates significant effectiveness in ensuring the SLO while enhancing GPU utilization.

Conclusion: FREEDA工具链能有效应对云边基础设施中微服务应用的部署挑战，实现多目标的平衡。

Abstract: Deploying microservice-based applications (MSAs) on heterogeneous and dynamic Cloud-Edge infrastructures requires balancing conflicting objectives, such as failure resilience, performance, and environmental sustainability. In this article, we introduce the FREEDA toolchain, designed to automate the failure-resilient and carbon-efficient deployment of MSAs over the Cloud-Edge Continuum.
  The FREEDA toolchain continuously adapts deployment configurations to changing operational conditions, resource availability, and sustainability constraints, aiming to maintain the MSA quality and service continuity while reducing carbon emissions. We also introduce an experimental suite using diverse simulated and emulated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the toolchain against real-world challenges, including resource exhaustion, node failures, and carbon intensity fluctuations. The results demonstrate FREEDA's capability to autonomously reconfigure deployments by migrating services, adjusting flavour selections, or rebalancing workloads, successfully achieving an optimal balance among resilience, efficiency, and environmental impact.

Motivation: 现实中很多数据集适合用超图建模，需高效的超图 motif 计数算法，尤其是 hypertriangles 计数算法。

Method: 受经典图算法启发，将方向和退化概念推广到超图，建立理论框架，据此开发算法并实现 DITCH。

Result: 实验表明 DITCH 比现有最优方法快 10 - 100 倍，且更节省内存。

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架和 DITCH 算法在超图中 hypertriangles 计数问题上表现优于现有方法，具有高效性和内存优势。

Abstract: Counting the number of small patterns is a central task in network analysis. While this problem is well studied for graphs, many real-world datasets are naturally modeled as hypergraphs, motivating the need for efficient hypergraph motif counting algorithms. In particular, we study the problem of counting hypertriangles - collections of three pairwise-intersecting hyperedges. These hypergraph patterns have a rich structure with multiple distinct intersection patterns unlike graph triangles.
  Inspired by classical graph algorithms based on orientations and degeneracy, we develop a theoretical framework that generalizes these concepts to hypergraphs and yields provable algorithms for hypertriangle counting. We implement these ideas in DITCH (Degeneracy Inspired Triangle Counter for Hypergraphs) and show experimentally that it is 10-100x faster and more memory efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 提高经典模式匹配算法在自然语言文本中的搜索效率。

Method: 对搜索模式预处理，找出统计上最少出现的字符‘锚点’，在该高熵位置先进行验证以快速排除非匹配窗口。

Result: 实现表明将基本语言统计信息融入经典模式匹配技术可提高性能。

Conclusion: 在不增加启发式复杂度的情况下，通过在指定位置验证能减少不必要比较，提高整体效率。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an enhancement to the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm tailored for natural language text. The approach involves preprocessing the search pattern to identify its statistically least frequent character, referred to as the "anchor." During the search, verification is first performed at this high-entropy position, allowing the algorithm to quickly discard non-matching windows. This fail-fast strategy reduces unnecessary comparisons, improving overall efficiency. Our implementation shows that incorporating basic linguistic statistics into classical pattern-matching techniques can boost performance without increasing complexity to the shift heuristics.

Result: 证明了即使图G是k - 连通的，k - 连通性预言机仍需Ω(kn)位空间

Conclusion: 肯定回答了Pettie等人提出的开放问题

Abstract: A $k$-connectivity oracle for a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a data structure that given $s,t \in V$ determines whether there are at least $k+1$ internally disjoint $st$-paths in $G$. For undirected graphs, Pettie, Saranurak & Yin [STOC 2022, pp. 151-161] proved that any $k$-connectivity oracle requires $Ω(kn)$ bits of space. They asked whether $Ω(kn)$ bits are still necessary if $G$ is $k$-connected. We will show by a very simple proof that this is so even if $G$ is $k$-connected, answering this open question.

Conclusion: 明确了分析本地快速重路由机制的计算复杂度，为无入端口信息场景提供有效算法。

Abstract: To achieve fast recovery from link failures, most modern communication networks feature fully decentralized fast re-routing mechanisms. These re-routing mechanisms rely on pre-installed static re-routing rules at the nodes (the routers), which depend only on local failure information, namely on the failed links incident to the node. Ideally, a network is perfectly resilient: the re-routing rules ensure that packets are always successfully routed to their destinations as long as the source and the destination are still physically connected in the underlying network after the failures. Unfortunately, there are examples where achieving perfect resilience is not possible. Surprisingly, only very little is known about the algorithmic aspect of when and how perfect resilience can be achieved.
  We investigate the computational complexity of analyzing such local fast re-routing mechanisms. Our main result is a negative one: we show that even checking whether a given set of static re-routing rules ensures perfect resilience is coNP-complete. We also show coNP-completeness of the so-called ideal resilience, a weaker notion of resilience often considered in the literature. Additionally, we investigate other fundamental variations of the problem. In particular, we show that our coNP-completeness proof also applies to scenarios where the re-routing rules have specific patterns (known as skipping in the literature).
  On the positive side, for scenarios where nodes do not have information about the link from which a packet arrived (the so-called in-port), we present linear-time algorithms for both the verification and synthesis problem for perfect resilience.

Result: 给出了输入为无固定画法平面图时面覆盖数问题的首个多项式核。

Conclusion: 克服了无预定义面边界集的挑战，解决了无固定画法平面图的面覆盖数问题的多项式核问题。

Abstract: Given a planar graph, a subset of its vertices called terminals, and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the Face Cover Number problem asks whether the terminals lie on the boundaries of at most $k$ faces of some embedding of the input graph. When a plane graph is given in the input, the problem is known to have a polynomial kernel~\cite{GarneroST17}. In this paper, we present the first polynomial kernel for Face Cover Number when the input is a planar graph (without a fixed embedding). Our approach overcomes the challenge of not having a predefined set of face boundaries by building a kernel bottom-up on an SPR-tree while preserving the essential properties of the face cover along the way.

Abstract: We consider turn-based stochastic two-player games with a combination of a parity condition that must hold surely, that is in all possible outcomes, and of a parity condition that must hold almost-surely, that is with probability 1. The problem of deciding the existence of a winning strategy in such games is central in the framework of synthesis beyond worst-case where a hard requirement that must hold surely is combined with a softer requirement. Recent works showed that the problem is coNP-complete, and infinite-memory strategies are necessary in general, even in one-player games (i.e., Markov decision processes). However, memoryless strategies are sufficient for the opponent player. Despite these comprehensive results, the known algorithmic solution enumerates all memoryless strategies of the opponent, which is exponential in all cases, and does not construct a winning strategy when one exists.
  We present a recursive algorithm, based on a characterisation of the winning region, that gives a deeper insight into the problem. In particular, we show how to construct a winning strategy to achieve the combination of sure and almost-sure parity, and we derive new complexity and memory bounds for special classes of the problem, defined by fixing the index of either of the two parity conditions.

Result: 证明在两种商品类型且估值为正的情况下，满足帕累托最优的 EFX 分配存在，并可在拟线性时间内计算。

Conclusion: 成果加强了现有工作，展示了一种相对简单有效的构造 EFX+PO 分配的算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations. We focus on envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) -- an important fairness notion in fair division of indivisible goods. A central open question in this field is whether EFX allocations always exist for any number of agents. While prior work has established EFX existence for settings with at most three distinct valuations (Prakash HV et al. 2025) and for two types of goods (Gorantla, Marwaha, and Velusamy 2023), the general case remains unresolved.
  In this paper, we extend the existent knowledge by proving that EFX allocations satisfying Pareto optimality (PO) always exist and can be computed in quasiliniear time when there are two types of goods, given that the valuations are positive. This result strengthens the existing work of (Gorantla, Marwaha, and Velusamy 2023), which only guarantees the existence of EFX allocations without ensuring Pareto optimality. Our findings demonstrate a fairly simple and efficient algorithm constructing an EFX+PO allocation.

Abstract: In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.
  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and the best-known strategic robustness guarantee. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory. This showcases the potential of translating standard regret guarantees into strategic robustness guarantees for specific games, without explicitly minimizing any form of swap regret.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples a retriever with a large language model (LLM) to ground generated responses in external evidence. While this framework enhances factuality and domain adaptability, it faces a key bottleneck: balancing retrieval recall with limited LLM context. Retrieving too few passages risks missing critical context, while retrieving too many overwhelms the prompt window, diluting relevance and increasing cost.
  We propose a two-stage retrieval pipeline that integrates LLM-driven query expansion to improve candidate recall and FlashRank, a fast marginal-utility reranker that dynamically selects an optimal subset of evidence under a token budget. FlashRank models document utility as a weighted combination of relevance, novelty, brevity, and cross-encoder evidence. Together, these modules form a generalizable solution that increases answer accuracy, faithfulness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing sequential recommendation models, even advanced diffusion-based approaches, often struggle to capture the rich semantic intent underlying user behavior, especially for new users or long-tail items. This limitation stems from their reliance on ID-based embeddings, which lack semantic grounding. We introduce LLMDiRec, a new approach that addresses this gap by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into an intent-aware diffusion model. Our approach combines collaborative signals from ID embeddings with rich semantic representations from LLMs, using a dynamic fusion mechanism and a multi-task objective to align both views. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We demonstrate that \modelname outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with particularly strong improvements in capturing complex user intents and enhancing recommendation performance for long-tail items.

Abstract: Visually rich documents (VRDs) challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with layout-dependent semantics, brittle OCR, and evidence spread across complex figures and structured tables. This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed success of sequential modeling, generative recommender, and large language model for recommendation. Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

Motivation: 航空航天行业任务依赖技术文档检索，但缺乏反映该领域术语和查询意图特征的公共信息检索基准。

Method: 提出STELLA框架，通过系统流程构建基准，生成TCQ和TAQ两种查询，结合CoD和自反思方法，实现混合跨语言扩展。

Abstract: Tasks in the aerospace industry heavily rely on searching and reusing large volumes of technical documents, yet there is no public information retrieval (IR) benchmark that reflects the terminology- and query-intent characteristics of this domain. To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks.

Result: 在亚马逊书籍数据集上使CTR相对提升22.5%，保持排名行为基本不变，消融实验验证策略和奖励设计有效。

Conclusion: Shielded RecRL能在不降低核心推荐准确性的情况下，通过丰富个性化解释提升推荐的用户体验。

Abstract: We introduce Shielded RecRL, a reinforcement learning approach to generate personalized explanations for recommender systems without sacrificing the system's original ranking performance. Unlike prior RLHF-based recommender methods that directly optimize item rankings, our two-tower architecture keeps the recommender's ranking model intact while a language model learns to produce helpful explanations. We design a composite reward signal combining explanation length, content relevance, and coherence, and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL-divergence constraint to fine-tune a large language model with only 0.4% of its parameters trainable via LoRA adapters. In experiments on an Amazon Books dataset (approximately 50K interactions in the fantasy and romance genres), Shielded RecRL improved the relative click-through rate (CTR) by 22.5% (1.225x over baseline) while keeping the recommender's item-ranking behavior virtually unchanged. An extensive ablation study confirms that our gradient shielding strategy and reward design effectively balance explanation quality and policy drift. Our results demonstrate that Shielded RecRL enhances user-facing aspects of recommendations through rich, personalized explanations without degrading core recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: 感知感知的偏见检测指标使管道结果能反映用户可察觉的偏见。

Abstract: Bias in web search has been in the spotlight of bias detection research for quite a while. At the same time, little attention has been paid to query suggestions in this regard. Awareness of the problem of biased query suggestions has been raised. Likewise, there is a rising need for automatic bias detection approaches. This paper adds on the bias detection pipeline for bias detection in query suggestions of person-related search developed by Bonart et al. \cite{Bonart_2019a}. The sparseness and lack of contextual metadata of query suggestions make them a difficult subject for bias detection. Furthermore, query suggestions are perceived very briefly and subliminally. To overcome these issues, perception-aware metrics are introduced. Consequently, the enhanced pipeline is able to better detect systematic topical bias in search engine query suggestions for person-related searches. The results of an analysis performed with the developed pipeline confirm this assumption. Due to the perception-aware bias detection metrics, findings produced by the pipeline can be assumed to reflect bias that users would discern.

Conclusion: 旨在弥合OLAP多维建模与现代RAG架构的差距，激发对大规模可解释检索策略的研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.

Conclusion: DiffSBR模型能有效解决现有方法不足，生成高质量潜在邻居以改善基于会话的推荐。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item that anonymous users may be interested in, based on their current session interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated that retrieving neighbor sessions to augment the current session can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly observed session data, neglecting latent neighbors - not directly observed but potentially relevant within the interest space - thereby failing to fully exploit the potential of neighbor sessions in recommendation. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel model of diffusion-based latent neighbor generation for session-based recommendation, named DiffSBR. Specifically, DiffSBR leverages two diffusion modules, including retrieval-augmented diffusion and self-augmented diffusion, to generate high-quality latent neighbors. In the retrieval-augmented diffusion module, we leverage retrieved neighbors as guiding signals to constrain and reconstruct the distribution of latent neighbors. Meanwhile, we adopt a training strategy that enables the retriever to learn from the feedback provided by the generator. In the self-augmented diffusion module, we explicitly guide the generation of latent neighbors by injecting the current session's multi-modal signals through contrastive learning. After obtaining the generated latent neighbors, we utilize them to enhance session representations for improving session-based recommendation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffSBR generates effective latent neighbors and improves recommendation performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design. We conclude by discussing four design principles for more robust AI-scientist systems, implications for autonomous scientific discovery, and we release all prompts, artifacts, and outputs at https://github.com/Lossfunk/ai-scientist-artefacts-v1

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Conclusion: 提出的综合框架可有效提升放射报告生成效果，减少事实幻觉。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，调节局部梯度动态能在异构数据分布下稳定联邦学习。

Conclusion: 调节局部梯度动态可有效稳定异构数据分布下的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Conclusion: 野火预测系统应整合严重程度排序、数据不平衡和季节性风险，未来需结合季节动态和不确定性信息改进极端事件预测。

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析在目标具有内在、实例异质难度的最后一层微调可解模型中的神经缩放定律，并将其与推理联系起来。

Method: 提出Latent Instance Difficulty (LID)模型，该模型中每个输入的目标方差由重尾分布的潜在“精度”控制，通过模拟和两个真实数据代理（CIFAR - 10H和数学师生蒸馏任务）验证预测。

Result: 泛化损失恢复标准缩放定律，pass@$k$失败率呈幂律衰减，指数$β_{eff}$与训练有关，随样本量增长后饱和；LID模型有可测试的封闭形式预测。

Conclusion: 学习会缩小误差分布的“硬尾”，模型的泛化误差改善会使pass@$k$曲线变陡，直至不可约目标方差占主导；给出的计算分配规则是在饱和前进行训练，饱和后进行推理尝试。

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Motivation: KAN设计虽准确可解释，但CPU推理成本高且难以应用标准量化工具链。

Method: 引入LUT - KAN方法，将边缘函数转换为分段查找表并进行仿射int8/uint8量化和线性插值，还提出“诚实基线”速度评估方法。

Result: 编译后的KAN模型在DoS攻击检测案例中保持分类质量，F1下降低于0.0002，NumPy后端降低12倍推理延迟，Numba后端降低10倍，L = 64时内存开销约10倍。

Conclusion: LUT - KAN方法在KAN层编译和量化上有效，能降低推理延迟，代码和工件公开可复现。

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

Conclusion: 所提方法提供了一个稳健、可考虑不确定性的替代模型，在不牺牲KCC模型可解释性和计算效率前提下，可改进混凝土本构模型。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

Conclusion: ALERT是有效且高效的零样本越狱检测器，能应对新出现和演变的攻击。

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

Conclusion: SIGMA为模型崩溃机制提供理论见解，是监测递归训练管道健康状况的实用可扩展工具。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型安全评估常高估鲁棒性，本文提出RAILS框架，无需梯度和先验知识，实现跨分词器集成攻击，在开源模型上成功率近100%，对闭源系统有高黑盒攻击可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在安全关键领域应用增多，需严格评估其对抗越狱攻击的鲁棒性，但现有自动化攻击受限，安全评估常高估鲁棒性。

Method: 引入RAILS框架，仅基于模型对数进行操作，采用新的自回归损失和基于历史的选择策略，消除梯度依赖以实现跨分词器集成攻击。

Result: RAILS在多个开源模型上达到近100%的成功率，对GPT和Gemini等闭源系统有高黑盒攻击可迁移性。

Conclusion: RAILS框架有效提升了大语言模型对抗越狱攻击评估的效果，能发现跨不同词汇表的通用对抗模式，增强对闭源系统的攻击可迁移性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

TL;DR: 引入基于注意力图频谱的无训练机制探针，分析12个模型和10种语言，得出稳定频谱指纹，揭示标准评估遗漏的不连续性，报告了四个结果，指出频谱可用于审计和训练机制验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基准只能告知模型做了什么，而不能说明如何做到，需要一种能揭示模型机制的方法。

Method: 将每层视为令牌图，计算代数连通性、平滑度和频谱熵。

Result: （1）特定课程过渡模型出现英语言法触发的连通性故障（PTCC）；（2）PTCC反映专业化权衡；（3）识别出四种处理策略；（4）定位PTCC到稀疏层，激活控制可部分恢复连通性；主导拓扑机制与分词密度更相关。

Conclusion: 注意力图频谱是用于审计和训练机制验证的实用工具。

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

Conclusion: 混合专家模型专业化程度远低于普遍认知，当前训练目标可能限制训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

Motivation: 现有新闻视频理解基准多关注单源、视频内推理，而现实新闻消费是多源的，需要模型比较不同来源视角、对齐证据和合成信息，故需新基准。

Result: 数据集包含429个新闻组、1405个视频和2501个高质量问题。

Conclusion: VNU - Bench对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Conclusion: stLID能够有效检测复杂滑坡，包括同一斜坡不同区域的多次连续故障，是一种更优的滑坡故障检测方法。

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Conclusion: LTS在ToT框架中有效，能实现经济高效的问题解决，适合对延迟敏感和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Conclusion: 提出的基于随机神经元的算子具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

Conclusion: ReLA 的学习表示和聚合为强化学习调度提供强决策支持，能实现快速作业完成和决策，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 可解释神经元能自然出现，有时无需复杂解释技术就能识别。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

Conclusion: GESCL是一种有效的持续学习方法，能减少参数和计算量，提升性能。

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在重推理场景下存在序列级优势归一化产生长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚稀释、标量目标丢弃成对偏好信息等局限性，导致昂贵的滚动监督未充分利用。

Method: 提出AMIR - GRPO，用直接从组内奖励排名构建的隐含DPO风格对比正则化器增强GRPO，无需额外注释。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AMIR - GRPO始终优于GRPO基线，能更清晰区分正确和错误推理链，覆盖范围更广。

Conclusion: AMIR - GRPO有效改善了GRPO在重推理场景的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

Result: SVEAD实现线性时间复杂度和常数空间复杂度，在45个数据集上实验显示优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: SVEAD方法能有效解决现有异常检测方法在局部密度不同数据集上的问题。

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯物理信息学习有潜力支持变压器资产管理中不确定性感知的预测和决策。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

Conclusion: TreeAdv方法有效解决了标准GRPO的问题，提高了样本效率，减少了长度偏差。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Conclusion: R³L能有效解决强化学习探索和利用问题，具有良好效果和稳定性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主导算法GRPO存在结构局限，其静态信任区域约束与结果驱动学习的异质性不匹配，无法充分利用高质量信号和抑制噪声，易导致熵快速坍塌。

Method: 提出弹性信任区域（ETR）动态机制，通过微观和宏观两级弹性构建信号感知格局。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准测试中，ETR始终优于GRPO，实现更高准确率，有效缓解策略熵退化。

Conclusion: ETR能更好地适应结果驱动学习的异质性，在性能和探索性上表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

Conclusion: EDCO框架有效改进了大语言模型的微调效果，提高了效率和适应性。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

Result: 轻量级且计算高效的GEM - 2能直接超越数值天气预报模型，与依赖复杂过程或微调策略的ML模型竞争，在多方面有出色表现。

Conclusion: GEM - 2在气象预报中有良好性能，对架构和训练设计选择不敏感，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

Result: 通过多数据集实验验证，模型歧义减小、规模变小且对预测性能影响小

Conclusion: 所提剪枝策略能在保持保真度的同时减少CFIRE算法模型的规则歧义

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

Conclusion: 在已知干净训练数据集和训练方法的情况下，所提方法能有效检测语义后门，具有较好的检测效果。

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，模型在遵循预定义逻辑约束方面显著优于传统GAN，且保持生成样本的质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在知识密集领域的生成建模中有增强潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

Motivation: 现有OSFL方法在医疗成像等领域难以实现鲁棒性能，处理非IID数据效率低，需改进。

Method: 利用特征感知的分层令牌序列生成和知识蒸馏，客户端压缩图像、生成合成序列，服务器引入知识蒸馏。

Result: 在医疗和自然图像数据集上的实验表明，FALCON在各种非IID场景中有效，平均准确率比最佳OSFL基线高出9.58%。

Conclusion: FALCON能有效增强OSFL在非IID图像数据上的表现。

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Method: 提出 SR - MoE，采用双重正则化，包括谱范数约束和稳定秩惩罚。

Result: 传统线性门控深度增加时失败（精度最多下降 4.72%），SR - MoE 保持结构完整性（平均干扰 - 0.32%），利于知识正向迁移。

Conclusion: SR - MoE 是构建高容量、模块化网络实现稳定终身学习的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

Result: 在三个持续学习基准测试和不同参数规模模型上的实验表明，FOREVER能持续缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: FOREVER框架有效解决大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Conclusion: 提出的新方法可减少参数数量，同时揭示问题的额外信息，具有一定优势。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Conclusion: 该方法推进自回归图生成和计算运动学综合，为复杂机械系统逆设计建立新范式。

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Result: Dynafit适用于涉及非线性动力系统和传感器的各类分类任务。

Conclusion: 通过混沌检测、手写动力学识别和视觉动态纹理识别三个例子证明了Dynafit的有效性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

TL;DR: 提出CausalMixFT方法解决数据稀缺时表格基础模型微调问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺时微调表格基础模型具有挑战性，现有在稀缺验证数据上的早停法难以准确评估泛化性能。

Method: 使用在目标数据集上拟合的结构因果模型生成结构一致的合成样本，增强微调鲁棒性和下游性能。

Result: 在33个分类数据集和超2300次微调实验中，CausalMixFT将中位归一化ROC - AUC从0.10提升到0.12，缩小验证 - 测试性能相关性差距至0.30。

Conclusion: 在数据增强中引入因果结构是低数据场景下表基模型微调的有效途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动血液形态分析受多种因素影响易出现数据集偏移，构建集中化数据集因隐私法规和数据共享限制常不可行。

Method: 引入用于白细胞形态分析的联邦学习框架，在不交换训练数据的情况下跨机构协作训练。

Result: 联邦训练在卷积和基于Transformer的架构评估中实现了强大的跨站点性能，相比集中化训练能更好地泛化到未见过的机构。

Conclusion: 联邦学习是在资源有限的医疗环境中开发公平、可扩展且可泛化的医学影像AI的实用且保护隐私的方法。

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在医疗数据应用中因缺乏标准化和语义明确表示，存在互操作性和可重复性问题，MEDS未与语义网集成。

Method: 引入MEDS - OWL本体，实现meds2rdf转换库，用合成临床数据集演示并以SHACL约束验证。

Result: MEDS - OWL首版含13个类、10个对象属性、20个数据属性和24个OWL公理，结合meds2rdf实现数据转换和互操作。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于事件的临床数据提供可复用语义层，为图分析奠定基础。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件工程代理验证方法存在难以扩展、缺乏代码库上下文和难解释的问题，需要更好的验证方式。

Method: 让专家代理与代码库交互创建基于上下文的规则清单，对候选补丁打分，无需测试执行。

Result: 在SWE - Bench Verified并行TTS评估中，Agentic Rubrics在Qwen3 - Coder - 30B - A3B上得分为54.2%，在Qwen3 - 32B上为40.6%，比对比组中最强基线至少高3.5个百分点，规则得分与真实测试一致且能标记测试未捕捉的问题。

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics为软件工程代理提供了一种高效、可扩展和细化的验证信号。

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

TL;DR: 提出深度学习框架，在严重噪声下从非线性薛定谔方程恢复物理参数，验证方法泛化性和鲁棒性，表明PINNs可替代传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在严重噪声和数据稀缺情况下，传统有限差分方法因数值导数噪声放大而失效，需寻找替代方法解决时空动力学逆问题。

Method: 将物理信息神经网络（PINNs）与自动微分结合，从含噪声的稀疏数据中恢复非线性系数。

Result: 仅用500个含20%高斯噪声的稀疏随机采样数据点，相对误差小于0.2%；在不同物理条件和数据可用性下，精度一致低于1%；多次运行标准差小于0.15%；完整流程在普通云GPU资源上约80分钟完成。

Conclusion: 基于物理的正则化可有效过滤高测量不确定性，PINNs可作为传统优化方法的可行替代方案，代码公开便于复现。

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

Method: 提出基于时间卷积网络骨干的轻量级测试时间自适应框架，引入因果自适应批量归一化、带经验回放的高斯混合模型对齐和元学习三种策略。

Result: 在NinaPro DB6多会话数据集上缩小了会话间准确率差距，经验回放更新在有限数据下稳定性好，元学习在少样本情况下表现有竞争力。

Conclusion: 为长期假肢使用的稳健、即插即用肌电控制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

This paper introduces a new robust model that employs parallel layers of place fields at multiple spatial scales, a replay-based reward mechanism, and dynamic scale fusion. Simulations show that the model improves path efficiency and accelerates learning compared to single-scale baselines, highlighting the value of multiscale spatial representations for adaptive robot navigation.

Motivation: 现有模块化优化框架缺乏实证研究探究哪些模块最重要及如何相互作用，需理解模块对不同问题算法性能的影响以提高寻找有效实现的效率。

Method: 分析PSO - X框架实例化的1424种算法在CEC'05基准套件25个函数（10和30维）上的性能，用功能ANOVA量化模块及其组合对不同问题类性能的影响，进行聚类分析。

Result: 各问题类中模块重要性变异性低，粒子群优化性能由少数有影响力的模块驱动。

Conclusion: 少数模块对粒子群优化性能有重要影响，可据此指导算法配置和进一步研究。

Abstract: The PSO-X framework incorporates dozens of modules that have been proposed for solving single-objective continuous optimization problems using particle swarm optimization. While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.

Abstract: Agile methods, and Scrum in particular, are widely taught in software engineering education; however, there is limited empirical evidence on how these practices function in long-running, student-led projects under academic and hybrid work constraints. This paper presents a year-long case study of an eight-person student development team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual reality game that simulates a university campus and provides program-related educational content. We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics. We propose practical recommendations for instructors and student teams adopting agile methods in hybrid, project-based learning settings.

Result: 跨越多个基准和骨干模型的实验表明，RepoShapley可提高完成质量，同时减少有害上下文和不必要的检索

Conclusion: RepoShapley是解决代码补全中交叉文件证据控制难题的有效框架

Abstract: Repository-level code completion benefits from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, controlling cross-file evidence is difficult because chunk utility is often interaction-dependent: some snippets help only when paired with complementary context, while others harm decoding when they conflict. We propose RepoShapley, a coalition-aware context filtering framework supervised by Shapley-style marginal contributions. Our module ChunkShapley constructs offline labels by (i) single-chunk probing with teacher-forced likelihood to estimate signed, weighted effects, (ii) a surrogate game that captures saturation and interference, (iii) exact Shapley computation for small retrieval sets, and (iv) bounded post-verification that selects a decoding-optimal coalition using the frozen generator. We distill verified $KEEP$ or $DROP$ decisions and retrieval triggering into a single model via discrete control tokens. Experiments across benchmarks and backbones show that RepoShapley improves completion quality while reducing harmful context and unnecessary retrieval.

Method: 对1039个GitHub仓库（422个OSS4SG和617个传统OSS项目）进行大规模实证研究，对比社区结构、贡献者参与度和编码实践。

Result: OSS4SG项目社区更稳定、“粘性”高，全年参与度一致，依赖核心贡献者保证代码质量和解决问题；传统OSS项目更“有吸引力”，贡献者流动大，参与度有季节性波动，利用临时贡献者解决问题。

Conclusion: 使命驱动的OSS4SG与传统OSS在社区结构、贡献者参与度和编码实践方面存在显著差异。

Abstract: Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects aim to address critical societal challenges, such as healthcare access and community safety. Understanding the community dynamics and contributor patterns in these projects is essential for ensuring their sustainability and long-term impact. However, while extensive research has focused on conventional Open Source Software (OSS), little is known about how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG influences its development practices. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices. Our findings reveal that OSS4SG projects foster significantly more stable and "sticky" (63.4%) communities, whereas conventional OSS projects are more "magnetic" (75.4%), attracting a high turnover of contributors. OSS4SG projects also demonstrate consistent engagement throughout the year, while conventional OSS communities exhibit seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, OSS4SG projects rely heavily on core contributors for both code quality and issue resolution, while conventional OSS projects leverage casual contributors for issue resolution, with core contributors focusing primarily on code quality.

Conclusion: 这种方法组合能实现针对性评估，指导提升大语言模型的编程能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly assessed based on their common sense reasoning, language comprehension, and logical reasoning abilities. While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories. This combination enables targeted evaluation and guides improvements in LLMs' programming proficiencies.

Result: 在HumanEval - X和TransCoder - Test基准测试中，所有翻译方向上均比基线大语言模型有显著改进，消融实验验证组件有效性。

Conclusion: BootTrans方法有效解决代码跨语言翻译的两个关键难题，提升翻译效果。

Abstract: Code translation across multiple programming languages is essential yet challenging due to two vital obstacles: scarcity of parallel data paired with executable test oracles, and optimization imbalance when handling diverse language pairs. We propose BootTrans, a bootstrapping method that resolves both obstacles. Its key idea is to leverage the functional invariance and cross-lingual portability of test suites, adapting abundant pivot-language unit tests to serve as universal verification oracles for multilingual RL training. Our method introduces a dual-pool architecture with seed and exploration pools to progressively expand training data via execution-guided experience collection. Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance. Extensive experiments on the HumanEval-X and TransCoder-Test benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline LLMs across all translation directions, with ablations validating the effectiveness of both bootstrapping and weighting components.

  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.
  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 借助AIDev数据集对智能体发起的拉取请求中的测试包含情况进行实证研究，发现含测试的拉取请求更普遍、规模更大、完成时间更长，各智能体在测试采用和代码平衡上有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能编码工具频繁发起拉取请求，需要了解测试在这些智能体驱动的工作流程中的情况。

Method: 使用AIDev数据集进行实证研究，考察测试包含频率、引入时间，对比含测试和不含测试拉取请求在规模、周转时间和合并结果等方面的差异。

Result: 含测试的拉取请求随时间更常见，往往规模更大、完成时间更长，但合并率大致相似，各智能体在测试采用和测试与生产代码平衡上存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究为智能体拉取请求中的测试行为提供了描述性视角，为未来自主软件开发研究提供实证依据。

Abstract: Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs. Our findings provide a descriptive view of testing behavior in agentic pull requests and offer empirical grounding for future studies of autonomous software development.

Method: 提出VSM - GQM - DevOps框架，整合价值流映射、目标 - 问题 - 指标范式和成熟度对齐的DevOps自动化；定义多地点、纵向混合方法验证方案。

Conclusion: 有望为组织提供一条经过验证的路径和实用工具，以选择能改善交付绩效和项目管理成果的自动化投资。

Abstract: DevOps automation can accelerate software delivery, yet many organizations still struggle to justify and prioritize automation work in terms of strategic project-management outcomes such as waste reduction, delivery predictability, cross-team coordination, and customer-facing quality. This paper presents \textit{VSM--GQM--DevOps}, a unified, traceable framework that integrates (i) Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to visualize the end-to-end delivery system and quantify delays, rework, and handoffs, (ii) the Goal--Question--Metric (GQM) paradigm to translate stakeholder objectives into a minimal, decision-relevant measurement model (combining DORA with project and team outcomes), and (iii) maturity-aligned DevOps automation to remediate empirically observed bottlenecks through small, reversible interventions. The framework operationalizes traceability from observed waste to goal-aligned questions, metrics, and automation candidates, and provides a defensible prioritization approach that balances expected impact, confidence, and cost. We also define a multi-site, longitudinal mixed-method validation protocol that combines telemetry-based quasi-experimental analysis (interrupted time series and, where feasible, controlled rollouts) with qualitative triangulation from interviews and retrospectives. The expected contribution is a validated pathway and a set of practical instruments that enables organizations to select automation investments that demonstrably improve both delivery performance and project-management outcomes.

Motivation: 机器学习算法在社会经济应用中可能产生不公平决策，虽有公平性实践建议，但需探究其可靠性和泛化性。

Method: 未提及。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly deployed to make critical decisions in socioeconomic applications such as finance, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts? These questions form the core theme of this paper.

Method: 给出高精度十进制常数列表，让模型生成嵌入常数并执行简单聚合计算的Python代码，描述提示变体、基于精确字符串包含的评估协议和分析框架。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该基准测试是紧凑压力测试，聚焦数据完整性，可补充现有代码生成评估。

Abstract: Many real-world software tasks require exact transcription of provided data into code, such as cryptographic constants, protocol test vectors, allowlists, and calibration tables. These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, evaluating repository-level reasoning, the ability to maintain logical consistency across massive, real-world, interdependent file systems, has become critical. Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试若概念不能代表实际项目使用情况，可能导致评估不完整，但代码概念的代表性未被系统检查，所以要进行相关研究。

Method: 通过知识单元（KUs）分析代码生成基准测试的代表性，分析两个Python基准测试的KU覆盖情况并与30个真实项目对比，提出基于提示的LLM框架生成新任务增强基准测试。

Result: 每个基准测试仅覆盖一半的20个已识别KU，真实项目使用所有KU且分布均衡；增强基准测试大幅提高KU覆盖和分布对齐，评估显示现有基准高估了LLM性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建更真实评估LLM代码生成能力提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude and LLaMA have shown impressive performance in code generation, typically evaluated using benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.
  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.
  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.

Result: 发现系统性差异，人口统计学属性显著影响选择可能性和任务分配，任务分布反映刻板印象。

Conclusion: 大语言模型加剧了软件工程环境中的人口统计学不平等，强调需要进行公平性评估。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to boost productivity and support software engineering tasks. However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet their behavior in structured, specification-driven processes remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study design using CURRANTE, a Visual Studio Code extension that enables a human-in-the-loop workflow for LLM-assisted code generation. The tool guides developers through three sequential stages--Specification, Tests, and Function--allowing them to define requirements, generate and refine test suites, and produce functions that satisfy those tests. Participants will solve medium-difficulty problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset, while the tool records fine-grained interaction logs, effectiveness metrics (e.g., pass rate, all-pass completion), efficiency indicators (e.g., time-to-pass), and iteration behaviors. The study aims to analyze how human intervention in specification and test refinement influences the quality and dynamics of LLM-generated code. The results will provide empirical insights into the design of next-generation development environments that align human reasoning with model-driven code generation.

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Background: Extracting the stages that structure Machine Learning (ML) pipelines from source code is key for gaining a deeper understanding of data science practices. However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.
  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.
  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis is conducted using Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare our insights on data science practices with those from prior studies.

Motivation: OT容器部署因需提升权限而有安全风险，现有方法存在缺乏可重复性、跨上下文解释性和技术集成等问题。

Method: 提出基于模型的方法，实现为容器安全风险本体（CSRO），整合五个关键领域。

Conclusion: CSRO目前专注容器级技术处理措施，其模块化和灵活设计为扩展到主机级和组织级风险因素提供基础。

Abstract: In operational technology (OT) contexts, containerised applications often require elevated privileges to access low-level network interfaces or perform administrative tasks such as application monitoring. These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.

Conclusion: ITS问题和隐患与上下文因素有关，应配置、监控和可视化这些隐患的潜在工具解决方案来应对挑战。

Abstract: Issue Tracking Systems (ITSs) enable software developers and managers to collect and resolve issues collaboratively. While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like "priority" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.

Abstract: This work introduces an end-to-end framework for multi-asset option pricing that combines market-consistent risk-neutral density recovery with quantum-accelerated numerical integration. We first calibrate arbitrage-free marginal distributions from European option quotes using the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) model, leveraging its analytical tractability and ability to capture skewness and fat tails. Marginals are coupled via a Gaussian copula to construct joint distributions. To address the computational bottleneck of the high-dimensional integration required to solve the option pricing formula, we employ Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) techniques based on Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), achieving quadratic convergence improvements over classical Monte Carlo (CMC) methods. Theoretical results establish accuracy bounds and query complexity for both marginal density estimation (via cosine-series expansions) and multidimensional pricing. Empirical tests on liquid equity entities (Credit Agricole, AXA, Michelin) confirm high calibration accuracy and demonstrate that QAMC requires 10-100 times fewer queries than classical methods for comparable precision. This study provides a practical route to integrate arbitrage-aware modelling with quantum computing, highlighting implications for scalability and future extensions to complex derivatives.

Abstract: Index tracking, also known as passive investing, has gained significant traction in financial markets due to its cost-effective and efficient approach to replicating the performance of a specific market index. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and strategies developed for index tracking, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. We categorize the index tracking models into three broad frameworks: optimization-based models, statistical-based models and machine learning based data-driven approach. A comprehensive empirical study conducted on the S\&P 500 dataset demonstrates that the tracking error volatility model under the optimization-based framework delivers the most precise index tracking, the convex co-integration model, under the statistical-based framework achieves the strongest return-risk balance, and the deep neural network with fixed noise model within the data-driven framework provides a competitive performance with notably low turnover and high computational efficiency. By combining a critical review of the existing literature with comparative empirical analysis, this paper aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of index tracking and its practical implications for investors and fund managers.

Conclusion: 基于TDA的拓扑风险度量比传统统计方法能更全面地理解投资组合动态，对现代投资组合管理实践具有重要意义。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA), an emerging field in investment sciences, harnesses mathematical methods to extract data features based on shape, offering a promising alternative to classical portfolio selection methodologies. We utilize persistence landscapes, a type of summary statistics for persistent homology, to capture the topological variation of returns, blossoming a novel concept of ``Topological Risk". Our proposed topological risk then quantifies portfolio risk by tracking time-varying topological properties of assets through the $L_p$ norm of the persistence landscape. Through optimization, we derive an optimal portfolio that minimizes this topological risk. Numerical experiments conducted using nearly a decade long S\&P 500 data demonstrate the superior performance of our TDA-based portfolios in comparison to the seven popular portfolio optimization models and two benchmark portfolio strategies, the naive $1/N$ portfolio and the S\&P 500 market index, in terms of excess mean return, and several financial ratios. The outcome remains consistent through out the computational analysis conducted for the varying size of holding and investment time horizon. These results underscore the potential of our TDA-based topological risk metric in providing a more comprehensive understanding of portfolio dynamics than traditional statistical measures. As such, it holds significant relevance for modern portfolio management practices.

Conclusion: Smart Predict - then - Optimize范式在现实和非平稳金融环境的投资组合优化中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Improvements in return forecast accuracy do not always lead to proportional improvements in portfolio decision quality, especially under realistic trading frictions and constraints. This paper adopts the Smart Predict--then--Optimize (SPO) paradigm for portfolio optimization in real markets, which explicitly aligns the learning objective with downstream portfolio decision quality rather than pointwise prediction accuracy. Within this paradigm, predictive models are trained using an SPO-based surrogate loss that directly reflects the performance of the resulting investment decisions. To preserve interpretability and robustness, we employ linear predictors built on return-based and technical-indicator features and integrate them with portfolio optimization models that incorporate transaction costs, turnover control, and regularization. We evaluate the proposed approach on U.S. ETF data (2015--2025) using a rolling-window backtest with monthly rebalancing. Empirical results show that decision-focused training consistently improves risk-adjusted performance over predict--then--optimize baselines and classical optimization benchmarks, and yields strong robustness during adverse market regimes (e.g., the 2020 COVID-19). These findings highlight the practical value of the Smart Predict--then--Optimize paradigm for portfolio optimization in realistic and non-stationary financial environments.

Abstract: Identifiability is central to the interpretability of deep latent variable models, ensuring parameterisations are uniquely determined by the data-generating distribution. However, it remains underexplored for deep regime-switching time series. We develop a general theoretical framework for multi-lag Regime-Switching Models (RSMs), encompassing Markov Switching Models (MSMs) and Switching Dynamical Systems (SDSs). For MSMs, we formulate the model as a temporally structured finite mixture and prove identifiability of both the number of regimes and the multi-lag transitions in a nonlinear-Gaussian setting. For SDSs, we establish identifiability of the latent variables up to permutation and scaling via temporal structure, which in turn yields conditions for identifiability of regime-dependent latent causal graphs (up to regime/node permutations). Our results hold in a fully unsupervised setting through architectural and noise assumptions that are directly enforceable via neural network design. We complement the theory with a flexible variational estimator that satisfies the assumptions and validate the results on synthetic benchmarks. Across real-world datasets from neuroscience, finance, and climate, identifiability leads to more trustworthy interpretability analysis, which is crucial for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 市场和保险中安全且福利一致的 AI 需要激励感知设计。

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly operate inside markets and institutions where data, behavior, and incentives are endogenous. This paper develops an economic foundation for multi-agent learning by studying a principal-agent interaction in a Markov decision process with strategic externalities, where both the principal and the agent learn over time. We propose a two-phase incentive mechanism that first estimates implementable transfers and then uses them to steer long-run dynamics; under mild regret-based rationality and exploration conditions, the mechanism achieves sublinear social-welfare regret and thus asymptotically optimal welfare. Simulations illustrate how even coarse incentives can correct inefficient learning under stateful externalities, highlighting the necessity of incentive-aware design for safe and welfare-aligned AI in markets and insurance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受流式模型下专家问题研究启发，考虑滑动窗口模型下的专家问题，该模型在交通监控、疫情跟踪等应用中有价值。

Method: 通过特定算法，使用2次查询和仅polylog(nT)位内存来实现目标。

Result: 在滑动窗口模型下用2次查询达到接近最优遗憾值，对任意时间区间也能达到特定遗憾值；在数据流多臂老虎机问题中取得次线性遗憾值，若最佳专家损失随机排序可达到最优遗憾值。

Conclusion: 所提算法在滑动窗口模型下是最优的，在多臂老虎机问题上取得了有意义的结果，实现了内存使用上的指数级改进。

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the experts problem in the streaming model, we consider the experts problem in the sliding window model. The sliding window model is a well-studied model that captures applications such as traffic monitoring, epidemic tracking, and automated trading, where recent information is more valuable than older data. Formally, we have $n$ experts, $T$ days, the ability to query the predictions of $q$ experts on each day, a limited amount of memory, and should achieve the (near-)optimal regret $\sqrt{nW}\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret over any window of the last $W$ days. While it is impossible to achieve such regret with $1$ query, we show that with $2$ queries we can achieve such regret and with only $\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory. Not only are our algorithms optimal for sliding windows, but we also show for every interval $\mathcal{I}$ of days that we achieve $\sqrt{n|\mathcal{I}|}\text{polylog}(nT)$ regret with $2$ queries and only $\text{polylog}(nT)$ bits of memory, providing an exponential improvement on the memory of previous interval regret algorithms. Building upon these techniques, we address the bandit problem in data streams, where $q=1$, achieving $n T^{2/3}\text{polylog}(T)$ regret with $\text{polylog}(nT)$ memory, which is the first sublinear regret in the streaming model in the bandit setting with polylogarithmic memory; this can be further improved to the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret if the best expert's losses are in a random order.

TL;DR: 提出基于三个尺度的框架分析类别不平衡对分类性能的影响，理论推导与实证结果相符，证实框架有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡显著降低分类性能，但很少从统一理论视角分析其影响。

Method: 提出基于不平衡系数$η$、样本 - 维度比$κ$和内在可分性$Δ$三个基本尺度的框架；从高斯贝叶斯分类器推导闭式贝叶斯误差。

Result: 通过改变$η$并固定$κ$和$Δ$，实证结果显示少数类召回率、准确率等指标变化与理论预测相符。

Conclusion: 三元组$(η,κ,Δ)$能对不平衡导致的性能退化给出与模型无关、基于几何原理的解释。

Abstract: Class imbalance significantly degrades classification performance, yet its effects are rarely analyzed from a unified theoretical perspective. We propose a principled framework based on three fundamental scales: the imbalance coefficient $η$, the sample--dimension ratio $κ$, and the intrinsic separability $Δ$. Starting from the Gaussian Bayes classifier, we derive closed-form Bayes errors and show how imbalance shifts the discriminant boundary, yielding a deterioration slope that predicts four regimes: Normal, Mild, Extreme, and Catastrophic. Using a balanced high-dimensional genomic dataset, we vary only $η$ while keeping $κ$ and $Δ$ fixed. Across parametric and non-parametric models, empirical degradation closely follows theoretical predictions: minority Recall collapses once $\log(η)$ exceeds $Δ\sqrtκ$, Precision increases asymmetrically, and F1-score and PR-AUC decline in line with the predicted regimes. These results show that the triplet $(η,κ,Δ)$ provides a model-agnostic, geometrically grounded explanation of imbalance-induced deterioration.

Motivation: 解决功能数据分析中大数据计算成本高和机构间数据共享受限的问题。

Method: 为三种标量 - 函数回归模型（FLM、FNPM、FPLM）提出分布式估计程序，进行蒙特卡罗模拟和实证研究。

Result: 分布式估计器大幅减少计算时间，保持高估计和预测精度；FPLM块太小时会过拟合，导致预测区间变窄和经验覆盖概率降低。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式估计程序有效，但FPLM要注意块大小避免过拟合。

Abstract: This paper proposes distributed estimation procedures for three scalar-on-function regression models: the functional linear model (FLM), the functional non-parametric model (FNPM), and the functional partial linear model (FPLM). The framework addresses two key challenges in functional data analysis, namely the high computational cost of large samples and limitations on sharing raw data across institutions. Monte Carlo simulations show that the distributed estimators substantially reduce computation time while preserving high estimation and prediction accuracy for all three models. When block sizes become too small, the FPLM exhibits overfitting, leading to narrower prediction intervals and reduced empirical coverage probability. An example of an empirical study using the \textit{tecator} dataset further supports these findings.

Conclusion: 指出未来研究方向包括基于学习的卫星网络机制设计。

Abstract: Resource management is one of the challenges in satellite networks due to their high mobility, wide coverage, long propagation distances, and stringent constraints on energy, communication, and computation resources. Traditional resource allocation approaches rely only on hard and rigid system performance metrics. Meanwhile, incentive mechanisms, which are based on game theory and auction theory, investigate systems from the "economic" perspective in addition to the "system" perspective. Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of incentive mechanism design for resource management in satellite networks. The paper covers key issues in the satellite networks, such as communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy and security, and coordination. We conclude with future research directions including learning-based mechanism design for satellite networks.

Conclusion: Monaas的链路层机制可行，在特定场景有潜在优势。

Abstract: The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 standard provides ultra high end-to-end reliability and low-power consumption for application in field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (> 5.8 s).

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可显著改善小区重选配置，增强移动网络性能。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of 5G networks, together with the coexistence of 4G/LTE networks, provides mobile devices a diverse set of candidate cells to connect to. However, associating mobile devices to cells to maximize overall network performance, a.k.a. cell (re)selection, remains a key challenge for mobile operators. Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios. These results indicate that data-driven approaches can significantly improve cell (re)selection configurations and enhance mobile network performance.

Motivation: 传统方法预测多组分和高熵合金熔点计算成本高，需开发新方法。

Method: 开发基于元素属性的XGBoost模型，排除温度相关热力学描述符，依靠元素特征，用VEC规则验证模型。

Result: 优化模型在约1300个成分验证集上R2为0.948，MSE为9928，相对误差约5%，能捕捉BCC和FCC相稳定性转变。

Conclusion: 数据驱动模型经适当特征工程可捕捉冶金原理用于快速合金筛选。

Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.

Conclusion: 该层次结构为识别能动性的信息前提提供了可测量、独立于基质的方法，并对具有能动性系统的伦理和功能评估有意义。

Abstract: As intelligent systems are developed across diverse substrates - from machine learning models and neuromorphic hardware to in vitro neural cultures - understanding what gives a system agency has become increasingly important. Existing definitions, however, tend to rely on top-down descriptions that are difficult to quantify. We propose a bottom-up framework grounded in a system's information-processing order: the extent to which its transformation of input evolves over time. We identify three orders of information processing. Class I systems are reactive and memoryless, mapping inputs directly to outputs. Class II systems incorporate internal states that provide memory but follow fixed transformation rules. Class III systems are adaptive; their transformation rules themselves change as a function of prior activity. While not sufficient on their own, these dynamics represent necessary informational conditions for genuine agency. This hierarchy offers a measurable, substrate-independent way to identify the informational precursors of agency. We illustrate the framework with neurophysiological and computational examples, including thermostats and receptor-like memristors, and discuss its implications for the ethical and functional evaluation of systems that may exhibit agency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as high level controllers for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions. However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $α^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.
  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $α^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $α^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

Conclusion: 所提出的将V2B优化问题建模为MDP并结合相应解决策略的方法有效，能更好地解决V2B优化问题。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.

Conclusion: 在分布式优化中加入局部更新可加速收敛，研究结果为高效实现提供实用指导，实验验证了理论。

Abstract: In conventional distributed optimization, each agent performs a single local update between two communication rounds with its neighbors to synchronize solutions. Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 呼吸音自动分类面临细微声学差异和临床数据集严重类不平衡问题，需缓解类不平衡来改进分类。

Method: 提出结合LSTM和KAN的混合深度学习模型，集成特征提取管道和不平衡缓解策略，运用焦点损失、特定类数据增强和SMOTE技术。

Result: 混合LSTM - KAN模型总体准确率达94.6%，宏平均F1分数为0.703，少数类检测性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出架构对不平衡呼吸音分类有效。

Abstract: Respiratory sounds captured via auscultation contain critical clues for diagnosing pulmonary conditions. Automated classification of these sounds faces challenges due to subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. This study investigates respiratory sound classification with a focus on mitigating pronounced class imbalance. We propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential feature encoding with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for classification. The model is integrated with a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline and targeted imbalance mitigation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a public respiratory sound database comprising six classes with a highly skewed distribution. Techniques such as focal loss, class-specific data augmentation, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to enhance minority class recognition. The proposed Hybrid LSTM-KAN model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703, despite the dominant COPD class accounting for over 86 percent of the data. Improved detection performance is observed for minority classes compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for imbalanced respiratory sound classification.

Motivation: 电喉语音自然度和可懂度低，需改进。

Conclusion: 轻量级语音转换架构适用于电喉语音康复，主要瓶颈是韵律生成和可懂度提升。

Abstract: Electro-laryngeal (EL) speech is characterized by constant pitch, limited prosody, and mechanical noise, reducing naturalness and intelligibility. We propose a lightweight adaptation of the state-of-the-art StreamVC framework to this setting by removing pitch and energy modules and combining self-supervised pretraining with supervised fine-tuning on parallel EL and healthy (HE) speech data, guided by perceptual and intelligibility losses. Objective and subjective evaluations across different loss configurations confirm their influence: the best model variant, based on WavLM features and human-feedback predictions (+WavLM+HF), drastically reduces character error rate (CER) of EL inputs, raises naturalness mean opinion score (nMOS) from 1.1 to 3.3, and consistently narrows the gap to HE ground-truth speech in all evaluated metrics. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of adapting lightweight voice conversion architectures to EL voice rehabilitation while also identifying prosody generation and intelligibility improvements as the main remaining bottlenecks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升IndexTTS 2的多语言覆盖、推理速度和整体合成质量。

Method: 采用语义编解码器压缩、架构升级、多语言扩展和强化学习优化四项改进。

Result: IndexTTS 2.5支持更广语言覆盖，能在零样本下复制未见语言的情感韵律，RTF提升2.28倍，WER和说话人相似度与IndexTTS 2相当。

Conclusion: IndexTTS 2.5在多语言情感TTS上有显著改进。

Abstract: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.

Method: 使用美国中学生议论文语料库，利用大语言模型生成每篇文章的多种风格变体，创建“生成面板”以分离内容和风格对成绩的影响。

Result: 在1 - 6分的评分中，社会经济地位差距为0.67分，约69%归因于内容质量差异，26%归因于风格差异，5%归因于不同社会经济群体的评估标准差异。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了大语言模型可在观测数据中生成可控变化，帮助研究者分离和量化相互纠缠因素的影响。

Abstract: Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a "generated panel" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors.

TL;DR: 对比猕猴IT区响应与不同ANN模型表现，发现当前视频模型难以捕捉IT区动态计算，需设新目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈ANN有局限，探究猕猴IT区的时间响应是简单前馈转化还是更丰富的动态计算。

Method: 对比猕猴IT区在自然视频中的响应和静态、循环、基于视频的ANN模型。对视频进行去外观处理，评估解码器泛化能力。

Result: 视频模型在神经预测性上有一定提升，尤其是后期响应阶段。猕猴IT区群体活动有泛化能力，所有ANN模型失败。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型更擅长捕捉与外观相关的动态，而非IT区的外观不变时间计算，需设新目标编码生物时间统计和不变性。

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决现有概念擦除方法的问题，在更具挑战性的基准上有应用价值。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

Method: 引入VLM4VLA进行公平高效对比，在多个基准上进行实证研究，对VLMs进行特定辅助任务微调，进行模态层面消融试验。

Result: VLM初始化有优势，但通用能力难预测下游任务表现；提升特定具身技能不保证下游控制性能提升；视觉模块是性能瓶颈，注入控制相关监督有提升。

Conclusion: 标准VLM能力对具身控制必要但不充分，当前VLM预训练目标与具身动作规划需求存在领域差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

Conclusion: 该技术有助于保持虾的新鲜度，使虾运输企业更有效地满足客户需求。

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

Result: 即使最佳模型（Gemini - 3.0 - Pro）也仅在66.47%的情况下正确分类错误。

Conclusion: 识别错误推理具有挑战性，准确识别错误能深入了解多模态推理模型能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Conclusion: 当前模型在构建和搜索合适概念表征以进行灵活图像到短语推理方面存在局限。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

Conclusion: 保留预训练视觉语言模型的广泛知识是实现稳健、可泛化驾驶性能的更有效策略，为开发视觉模型提供新途径。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Result: 得到可解码的任意高精度形状描述符及其类似的旋转不变量。

Conclusion: 扩展方法可用于分子形状描述、图像/扫描中的目标识别、形状相似度度量等旋转不变特征应用。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Conclusion: SDCD能有效抑制纹理驱动的偏差，减轻大视觉语言模型的物体幻觉问题，提升其多模态能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Method: 在KITTI验证集上，比较不同深度骨干网络，测试点云增强方法，进行深度精度与距离诊断。

Result: NeWCRFs在下游3D检测表现更好，点云增强特征提升有限，掩码采样可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 在现成激光雷达检测器下，深度骨干网络选择和几何保真度主导性能，二次特征注入影响小。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Method: 使用CoTracker跟踪视频帧中随机初始化的点，将轨迹和对应图像帧作为基于Transformer的识别模型输入。

Result: 即使仅提供初始帧及其关联点轨迹，该方法也能取得显著提升；实验表明集成2D点轨迹相比无运动信息训练的模型性能持续增强。

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹可作为以自我为中心的动作理解的轻量级且有效表示。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Conclusion: 大语言模型可通过非文本反馈循环实现任务级推理，无需明确的符号奖励。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Conclusion: CSMCIR框架有效解决了现有CIR方法的表示空间碎片化问题，提高了检索性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Result: 在RealEstate10K、ACID、DL3DV等数据集实验中，IDESplat重建质量出色，性能达最优，有实时效率；在RE10K上PSNR比DepthSplat高0.33 dB，参数仅用10.7%，内存用70%；在DTU数据集跨数据集实验中PSNR比DepthSplat高2.95 dB。

Conclusion: IDESplat能有效提升深度概率估计，实现准确高斯均值预测，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在 UI 定位任务中处理高分辨率截图时计算开销大、注意力分散，而人类交互时关注感兴趣区域，因此要开展高效 UI 定位任务。

Method: 提出 FocusUI 框架，通过融合指令条件分数和基于规则的 UI 图分数构建补丁级监督消除冗余标记；引入 PosPad 策略保留视觉标记选择时的位置连续性。

Result: 在四个定位基准测试中，FocusUI 超越特定于 GUI 的基线。在 ScreenSpot - Pro 基准上，FocusUI - 7B 比 GUI - Actor - 7B 性能提高 3.7%，仅保留 30% 视觉标记时，性能仅下降 3.2%，推理速度快 1.44 倍，GPU 峰值内存降低 17%。

Conclusion: FocusUI 在高效 UI 定位任务中表现良好，能有效减少计算开销并保持性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖多样本排序和特定任务的评判模型，效率低且全局监督模糊，需改进。

Method: 构建LocalDPO框架，从真实视频构建局部偏好对，设计自动流程收集数据，用区域感知DPO损失训练。

Result: 在Wan2.1和CogVideoX上实验表明，LocalDPO提升了视频保真度、时间连贯性和人类偏好得分。

Conclusion: LocalDPO为视频生成器对齐建立了更高效、细粒度的范式。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Conclusion: 大多模态模型推理链存在文本惯性问题，所提方法能有效缓解并提升推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: 该多模态方法是处理卫星图像时间序列和遥感图像的强大自监督框架。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Method: 从模型架构采用单塔设计、训练策略采用渐进式多任务机制、数据管理构造大规模数据集和自动化数据构建管道三个方面着手

Result: Klear在联合和单模态设置下实现高保真、语义和时间对齐、遵循指令的生成，泛化能力强，在多项任务上大幅超越先前方法

Conclusion: Klear为下一代音视频合成提供统一、可扩展的途径

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能根据身体动作预判3D世界响应，机器人操作也需此能力，因此要构建3D世界模型。

Method: 将状态和动作统一为3D点流，用RGB - D图像和机器人动作指令预测3D像素位移；构建大规模数据集训练模型；进行多方面大规模实证研究。

Result: PointWorld推理速度实时（0.1s），可集成到MPC框架；单个预训练检查点能让真实世界的Franka机器人完成多种操作。

Conclusion: 提炼出大规模3D世界建模的设计原则，PointWorld在机器人操作中有良好表现。

Abstract: Humans anticipate, from a glance and a contemplated action of their bodies, how the 3D world will respond, a capability that is equally vital for robotic manipulation. We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

Conclusion: 生成视频与现实有明显差距，凸显在具身AI中对世界模型进行基准测试的紧迫性和必要性。

Abstract: As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.

Abstract: Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.

Conclusion: MetagenBERT提供可扩展、无注释的宏基因组表示，有望实现跨队列和测序技术的表型泛化。

Abstract: Metagenomic disease prediction commonly relies on species abundance tables derived from large, incomplete reference catalogs, constraining resolution and discarding valuable information contained in DNA reads. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MetagenBERT, a Transformer based framework that produces end to end metagenome embeddings directly from raw DNA sequences, without taxonomic or functional annotations. Reads are embedded using foundational genomic language models (DNABERT2 and the microbiome specialized DNABERTMS), then aggregated through a scalable clustering strategy based on FAISS accelerated KMeans. Each metagenome is represented as a cluster abundance vector summarizing the distribution of its embedded reads. We evaluate this approach on five benchmark gut microbiome datasets (Cirrhosis, T2D, Obesity, IBD, CRC). MetagenBERT achieves competitive or superior AUC performance relative to species abundance baselines across most tasks. Concatenating both representations further improves prediction, demonstrating complementarity between taxonomic and embedding derived signals. Clustering remains robust when applied to as little as 10% of reads, highlighting substantial redundancy in metagenomes and enabling major computational gains. We additionally introduce MetagenBERT Glob Mcardis, a cross cohort variant trained on the large, phenotypically diverse MetaCardis cohort and transferred to other datasets, retaining predictive signal including for unseen phenotypes, indicating the feasibility of a foundation model for metagenome representation. Robustness analyses (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, entropy) show consistent separation of different states across subsamples. Overall, MetagenBERT provides a scalable, annotation free representation of metagenomes pointing toward future phenotype aware generalization across heterogeneous cohorts and sequencing technologies.

Conclusion: 提出的物理一致框架在增强型地热系统温度预测中有效，高斯过程代理模型表现最佳。

Abstract: Reliable temperature forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is essential, yet petroleum-based decline curves and many machine-learning surrogates do not enforce geothermal heat transfer, while thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) simulation remains computationally expensive. This study proposes a physics-consistent framework that advances both decline-curve analysis and surrogate modeling. The classical Arps decline family is generalized for geothermal use by introducing an equilibrium-temperature term motivated by Newton-type cooling, ensuring finite late-time temperature limits while reducing exactly to the conventional Arps forms when the equilibrium term is set to zero. The extended decline curves are validated against Utah FORGE downhole temperature measurements and then used to construct learning surrogates on a controlled THM dataset spanning fracture count, well spacing, fracture spacing, host-rock thermal conductivity, and circulation rate. An equation-informed neural network embeds the modified decline equations as differentiable internal computational layers to produce full 0-60 month temperature trajectories from design and operational inputs. A probabilistic Gaussian Process Regression surrogate is also developed for direct multi-horizon forecasting with calibrated uncertainty, while a direct XGBoost regression baseline provides a purely data-driven reference. Across the simulation dataset, the extended decline models reproduce temperature trajectories with near-perfect fidelity (median RMSE = 0.071 °C), and the equation-informed network achieves typical hold-out errors of MAE = 3.06 °C and RMSE = 4.49 °C. The Gaussian Process surrogate delivers the strongest predictive accuracy across 3-60 month horizons (RMSE = 3.39 °C; MAE = 2.34 °C) with well-calibrated uncertainty, whereas the XGBoost baseline exhibits higher errors.

Abstract: Disaster response requires sharing heterogeneous artifacts, from tabular assistance records to UAS imagery, under overlapping privacy mandates. Operational systems often reduce compliance to binary access control, which is brittle in time-critical workflows. We present a novel deontic knowledge graph-based framework that integrates a Disaster Management Knowledge Graph (DKG) with a Policy Knowledge Graph (PKG) derived from IoT-Reg and FEMA/DHS privacy drivers. Our release decision function supports three outcomes: Allow, Block, and Allow-with-Transform. The latter binds obligations to transforms and verifies post-transform compliance via provenance-linked derived artifacts; blocked requests are logged as semantic privacy incidents. Evaluation on a 5.1M-triple DKG with 316K images shows exact-match decision correctness, sub-second per-decision latency, and interactive query performance across both single-graph and federated workloads.

Abstract: Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making.

Motivation: 基于大语言模型的智能体部署增多，急需IP保护和监管溯源，但现有内容水印无法识别高层规划行为，规划行为层水印面临挑战。

Result: 在不同环境的实验中展示了实用的多位容量、从部分日志中稳健恢复和实用性保留。

Conclusion: AgentMark框架能有效解决规划行为层水印问题，实现IP保护和监管溯源。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed to autonomously solve complex tasks, raising urgent needs for IP protection and regulatory provenance. While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型易受越狱攻击，单层防御常牺牲安全换可用性。

Method: 结合四层异构机制构建TRYLOCK架构，包括通过DPO实现权重级安全对齐、通过RepE转向进行激活级控制、用轻量级旁路分类器选择自适应转向强度、输入规范化。

Result: 在249个攻击提示集上评估相对ASR降低88.0%；各层有独特防御效果，发现非单调转向现象；自适应旁路在保持防御效果下降低过拒率。

Conclusion: 安全和可用性不必相互排斥，且开源组件便于复现。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and single-layer defenses often trade security for usability. We present TRYLOCK, the first defense-in-depth architecture that combines four heterogeneous mechanisms across the inference stack: weight-level safety alignment via DPO, activation-level control via Representation Engineering (RepE) steering, adaptive steering strength selected by a lightweight sidecar classifier, and input canonicalization to neutralize encoding-based bypasses. On Mistral-7B-Instruct evaluated against a 249-prompt attack set spanning five attack families, TRYLOCK achieves 88.0% relative ASR reduction (46.5% to 5.6%), with each layer contributing unique coverage: RepE blocks 36% of attacks that bypass DPO alone, while canonicalization catches 14% of encoding attacks that evade both. We discover a non-monotonic steering phenomenon -- intermediate strength (alpha=1.0) degrades safety below baseline -- and provide mechanistic hypotheses explaining RepE-DPO interference. The adaptive sidecar reduces over-refusal from 60% to 48% while maintaining identical attack defense, demonstrating that security and usability need not be mutually exclusive. We release all components -- trained adapters, steering vectors, sidecar classifier, preference pairs, and complete evaluation methodology -- enabling full reproducibility.

Conclusion: LRCM框架有效提升了舞蹈动作生成的性能，具有应用价值。

Abstract: Advances in generative models and sequence learning have greatly promoted research in dance motion generation, yet current methods still suffer from coarse semantic control and poor coherence in long sequences. In this work, we present Listen to Rhythm, Choose Movements (LRCM), a multimodal-guided diffusion framework supporting both diverse input modalities and autoregressive dance motion generation. We explore a feature decoupling paradigm for dance datasets and generalize it to the Motorica Dance dataset, separating motion capture data, audio rhythm, and professionally annotated global and local text descriptions. Our diffusion architecture integrates an audio-latent Conformer and a text-latent Cross-Conformer, and incorporates a Motion Temporal Mamba Module (MTMM) to enable smooth, long-duration autoregressive synthesis. Experimental results indicate that LRCM delivers strong performance in both functional capability and quantitative metrics, demonstrating notable potential in multimodal input scenarios and extended sequence generation. We will release the full codebase, dataset, and pretrained models publicly upon acceptance.

Motivation: 机器学习可解释性与隐私保障存在冲突，从业者缺乏平衡透明度和隐私的指导。

Method: 开发更强的解释感知成员推理攻击量化信息泄漏；引入模型无关的缓解策略；通过控制实验进行根本原因分析。

Result: 默认设置比之前报告多泄漏74.9%成员信息，缓解措施最多减少95%泄漏，平均效用损失<=3.3%。

Conclusion: DeepLeak为隐私敏感的机器学习提供了系统、可重复的安全可解释性途径。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) explainability is central to algorithmic transparency in high-stakes settings such as predictive diagnostics and loan approval. However, these same domains require rigorous privacy guaranties, creating tension between interpretability and privacy. Although prior work has shown that explanation methods can leak membership information, practitioners still lack systematic guidance on selecting or deploying explanation techniques that balance transparency with privacy.
  We present DeepLeak, a system to audit and mitigate privacy risks in post-hoc explanation methods. DeepLeak advances the state-of-the-art in three ways: (1) comprehensive leakage profiling: we develop a stronger explanation-aware membership inference attack (MIA) to quantify how much representative explanation methods leak membership information under default configurations; (2) lightweight hardening strategies: we introduce practical, model-agnostic mitigations, including sensitivity-calibrated noise, attribution clipping, and masking, that substantially reduce membership leakage while preserving explanation utility; and (3) root-cause analysis: through controlled experiments, we pinpoint algorithmic properties (e.g., attribution sparsity and sensitivity) that drive leakage.
  Evaluating 15 explanation techniques across four families on image benchmarks, DeepLeak shows that default settings can leak up to 74.9% more membership information than previously reported. Our mitigations cut leakage by up to 95% (minimum 46.5%) with only <=3.3% utility loss on average. DeepLeak offers a systematic, reproducible path to safer explainability in privacy-sensitive ML.

Motivation: 现有防御方法难以应对多轮越狱攻击的快速演变，需新防御方案。

Method: 提出 HoneyTrap 框架，整合四个防御代理协作防御；引入 MTJ - Pro 数据集评估；提出 Mislead Success Rate 和 Attack Resource Consumption 两个新指标。

Result: 在多个模型上实验，HoneyTrap 使攻击成功率平均降低 68.77%；在自适应攻击环境中仍有韧性，提高 Mislead Success Rate 和 Attack Resource Consumption 分别达 118.11% 和 149.16%。

Conclusion: HoneyTrap 框架能有效防御大语言模型越狱攻击，可浪费攻击者资源且不影响良性查询。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose significant threats to large language models (LLMs), enabling attackers to bypass safeguards. However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively.

Result: 生成的漫画头像在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架能生成逼真、可进行几何控制的漫画头像，支持局部编辑和连续强度控制及实时变形。

Abstract: A photorealistic and controllable 3D caricaturization framework for faces is introduced. We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.

Conclusion: 提供了可复现的基础，用于开发特定领域的科学助手。

Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.

Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from 'held-out' phage display rounds.

Result: 有对比上下文时模型性能强，无参考设置下模型有显著弱点，包括预测不稳定和无效输出增多。

Conclusion: 当前模型在无外部依据时难保持连贯信念状态，RFC Bench为研究无参考推理和现实场景虚假信息检测提供结构化测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce RFC Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on financial misinformation under realistic news. RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding. By highlighting this gap, RFC Bench provides a structured testbed for studying reference free reasoning and advancing more reliable financial misinformation detection in real world settings.

Motivation: 不清楚自然语言统计规律与当代Transformer模型标记化方案的关系。

Method: 理论分析不同语料信息熵，推导槽熵期望值的闭式表达式；实证研究BPE对语料统计的转换；在不同BPE深度标记的语料上训练语言模型；使用基于注意力的诊断方法。

Result: 递归应用BPE使标记频率趋向Zipf幂律，诱导经验熵呈现特征增长模式；随着BPE深度增加，模型预测熵与Zipf推导预测更吻合；更深的标记化减少局部标记依赖性。

Conclusion: BPE不仅是压缩机制，也是重构自然语言关键信息属性的统计变换。

Abstract: Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性文本分割中定义主题边界、处理语篇结构变化和平衡局部连贯与全局上下文存在困难，影响下游应用。

Method: 提出SegNSP，采用无标签的NSP方法，用分割感知损失和难负采样增强，避免特定任务监督。

Result: 在CitiLink - Minutes数据集上B - $F_1$为0.79，在WikiSection数据集上B - $F_1$为0.65，优于TopSeg。

Conclusion: 建模句间连续性能提高分割质量，支持下游NLP应用。

Abstract: Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.

Method: 提出DeepResearch - Slice神经符号框架，预测精确的跨度索引，在推理前进行确定性硬过滤。

Result: 在六个基准测试中显示出显著的鲁棒性提升，应用于冻结骨干网络时相对提升73%，从19.1%提升到33.0%，且无需更新推理模型参数来减轻噪声。

Conclusion: 开放式研究中需要显式接地机制。

Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indices to perform a deterministic hard filter before reasoning. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show substantial robustness gains. Applying our method to frozen backbones yields a 73 percent relative improvement, from 19.1 percent to 33.0 percent, effectively mitigating noise without requiring parameter updates to the reasoning model. These results highlight the need for explicit grounding mechanisms in open-ended research.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型谄媚问题是需外部监管还是仅靠内部推理缓解。

Method: 使用对抗性数据集CAP - GSM8K，评估GPT - 3.5、GPT - 4o和GPT - 5.1的内部思维链（CoT）与外部纠正机制（RCA）。

Result: 内部推理有结构局限，在弱模型中导致性能崩溃，前沿模型有11.4%输出差距；RCA能消除谄媚（0.0%）。

Conclusion: 外部结构约束对保证大语言模型安全是必要的。

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in clinical decision-making, yet the deployment of proprietary systems is hindered by privacy concerns and reliance on cloud-based infrastructure. Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5.

TL;DR: 介绍2025年8月OpenAI发布GPT - 5的系统卡，包括系统构成、性能提升、安全特性及能力评估等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布GPT - 5系统卡，展示其新特性和优势，说明安全措施。

Method: 构建统一系统，含不同模型和实时路由器，路由器根据多种因素选择模型并持续训练；采用安全完成技术进行安全训练。

Result: GPT - 5在基准测试中表现优于前代，回答更快，减少幻觉、提升指令遵循度和减少附和现象，在写作、编码和健康领域表现提升，具备安全完成特性。

Conclusion: GPT - 5性能提升且更实用，对gpt - 5 - thinking在生物化学领域采取预防措施。

Abstract: This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025.
  GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.
  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.
  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.

Motivation: 大语言模型在企业环境部署时存在对自定义指令遵守不一致的问题，需要评估其在指令遵守等方面能力。

Method: 通过样本的系统测试和企业级评估协议，对13个领先的大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 各模型在指令遵循方面差异巨大，Claude - Sonnet - 4和GPT - 5表现最佳，存在模型能完成一般任务但难精确遵守企业所需指令的“指令差距”。

Conclusion: 为部署大语言模型解决方案的组织提供了实用见解，为主要模型家族的指令遵循能力设定了基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet their deployment in enterprise environments reveals a critical limitation: inconsistent adherence to custom instructions. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of 13 leading LLMs across instruction compliance, response accuracy, and performance metrics in realworld RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios. Through systematic testing with samples and enterprise-grade evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that instruction following varies dramatically across models, with Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 achieving the highest results. Our findings reveal the "instruction gap" - a fundamental challenge where models excel at general tasks but struggle with precise instruction adherence required for enterprise deployment. This work provides practical insights for organizations deploying LLM-powered solutions and establishes benchmarks for instruction-following capabilities across major model families.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型垂直领域评估基准有语义冗余和高计算成本问题，现有压缩方法不适用于冷启动场景，本文提出无历史依赖的测试集压缩框架，实验证明可有效减少评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型垂直领域评估基准语义冗余、计算成本高，且现有压缩方法不适用于冷启动场景的问题。

Method: 在少量特定领域数据上微调基础大语言模型，生成原始测试样本的语义嵌入，进行任务感知聚类，并引入数据集X射线机制动态校准压缩强度。

Result: 在专业领域数据集上实验表明，该方法能有效识别和移除冗余样本，将评估成本降低90%以上，同时保持与完整基准的高保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的无历史依赖测试集压缩框架能有效解决现有评估基准问题，降低评估成本。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.
  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.
  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出统一多视角基准数据集GuardEval和微调模型GGuard评估内容审核，表现优于现有模型，证明多视角安全基准及多样数据的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在检测细微有害内容时存在困难，且依赖训练数据会强化社会偏见，需更安全的审核系统。

Method: 引入包含106个细分类别的数据集GuardEval，并在其上微调Gemma3 - 12B模型得到GGuard进行内容审核评估。

Result: GGuard的宏观F1分数达0.832，大幅超过OpenAI Moderator和Llama Guard等领先审核模型。

Conclusion: 多视角、以人类为中心的安全基准对减少有偏见和不一致的审核决策至关重要，多样且有代表性的数据能改善复杂边缘情况下安全性、公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.

Motivation: 提供一个可利用大语言模型分析虚构角色个性的工具，实现高效且可重复的角色分析。

Method: 开发LLM_annotate包，包含文本分块、基于LLM的标注、角色名称消歧等功能，用户可使用任意LLM。

Result: 通过《辛普森一家》电影和《傲慢与偏见》的示例展示了包的使用。

Conclusion: LLM_annotate包能用于高效且可重复的角色分析。

Abstract: LLM_annotate is a Python package for analyzing the personality of fiction characters with large language models. It standardizes workflows for annotating character behaviors in full texts (e.g., books and movie scripts), inferring character traits, and validating annotation/inference quality via a human-in-the-loop GUI. The package includes functions for text chunking, LLM-based annotation, character name disambiguation, quality scoring, and computation of character-level statistics and embeddings. Researchers can use any LLM, commercial, open-source, or custom, within LLM_annotate. Through tutorial examples using The Simpsons Movie and the novel Pride and Prejudice, I demonstrate the usage of the package for efficient and reproducible character analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往主题分割方法缺乏大语言模型的长距离依赖和丰富知识，大语言模型用于主题分割的研究较少。

Method: 提出使用句子枚举的重叠和递归提示策略，支持采用边界相似度评估指标。

Result: 大语言模型作为分割器比现有方法更有效。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在用于主题分割前仍有问题需要解决。

Abstract: Topic segmentation using generative Large Language Models (LLMs) remains relatively unexplored. Previous methods use semantic similarity between sentences, but such models lack the long range dependencies and vast knowledge found in LLMs. In this work, we propose an overlapping and recursive prompting strategy using sentence enumeration. We also support the adoption of the boundary similarity evaluation metric. Results show that LLMs can be more effective segmenters than existing methods, but issues remain to be solved before they can be relied upon for topic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在边缘设备部署受“内存墙”限制，标准推理运行时存在显著开销。

Method: 实现软件“虚拟张量核心”架构，绕过标准库容器采用直接内存映射，实现手动调优的NEON SIMD内核，提出张量虚拟化布局保证缓存行利用率，用零拷贝加载器消除初始化延迟。

Result: 在110M参数模型的M2硬件实验中，实现>60 tokens/秒的稳定吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用ARM芯片研究内存瓶颈提供完全开放、便携和确定性的参考实现，能满足心理语言学延迟阈值且无不透明依赖。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.

Result: 发现训练数据中隐喻与大语言模型推理内容不一致程度有强因果关系，干预后模型跨领域不一致程度显著变化，设计的检测器能高精度预测不一致内容。

Conclusion: 隐喻与大语言模型推理路径存在关联，可通过监测潜在特征设计检测器预测不一致内容。

Abstract: Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出Cross - Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT)方法实现无训练适配临床模型，在多任务上表现优于其他方法并具临床优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通过持续预训练和微调使语言模型适应临床领域的方法，每次新模型生成需高成本再训练。

Method: 提出CAPT，一种模型集成方法，利用对比解码，支持不相交词汇表的模型，注入临床相关信号。

Result: 在六个临床分类和文本生成任务上，CAPT与新一代通用领域模型和旧一代临床模型结合，表现优于单个模型和现有集成方法。

Conclusion: CAPT能放大临床可操作语言，减少上下文错误，提高临床特异性。

Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改变大语言模型安全评估的范式，从受限的基于示例的方法转变为更广泛有效的基于策略的框架。

Method: 利用攻击大语言模型生成大量多样的对抗性提示，并用偏好数据集微调攻击模型。

Result: 在攻击开源和专有模型（如GPT - 40和Claude 3.5）时，攻击成功率显著高于现有技术。

Conclusion: Jailbreak - Zero是识别和缓解大语言模型安全漏洞的更具可扩展性和全面性的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.

Method: 比较人类和大语言模型两类评估者，在三种尺度和六个基准上收集评分，用组内相关系数测量绝对一致性。

Result: 大语言模型在主观基准上跨尺度评分不一致，评分尺度选择会显著改变人机一致性，0 - 5评分尺度人机一致性最强；汇总可靠性会掩盖基准异质性，不同性别组存在系统性子组差异。

Conclusion: 评分尺度设计和子级诊断是大语言模型评估协议的重要组成部分。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, yet prior works demonstrate that these LLM judges often lack consistency in scoring when the prompt is altered. However, the effect of the grading scale itself remains underexplored. We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment. We further demonstrate that pooled reliability can mask benchmark heterogeneity and reveal systematic subgroup differences in alignment across gender groups, strengthening the importance of scale design and sub-level diagnostics as essential components of LLM-as-a-judge protocols.

Result: 为从业者提供有效评估大小语言模型在实际应用的工具，代码开源。

Conclusion: 新评估框架可用于实际应用，尤其在边缘和私有计算场景。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted language model evaluation toward reasoning and problem-solving tasks as measures of general intelligence. Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning. This work provides practitioners with tools to effectively benchmark both SLMs and LLMs for practical applications, particularly in edge and private computing scenarios. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/wraval.

TL;DR: 提出首个流行病学问答诊断基准EpiQAL，通过实验发现当前大语言模型流行病学推理能力有限，EpiQAL能提供细粒度诊断信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学问答基准很少系统评估基于证据的流行病学推断，为填补这一空白开展研究。

Method: 构建包含三个子集的EpiQAL基准，结合专家设计的分类学指导、多模型验证和基于检索的难度控制。在十个开源模型上进行实验。

Result: 当前大语言模型在流行病学推理上表现有限，多步推理挑战最大，模型排名在不同子集不同，规模不能预测成功，思维链提示对多步推理有益但其他方面结果不一。

Conclusion: EpiQAL为证据接地、推理和结论重建提供了细粒度的诊断信号。

Abstract: Reliable epidemiological reasoning requires synthesizing study evidence to infer disease burden, transmission dynamics, and intervention effects at the population level. Existing medical question answering benchmarks primarily emphasize clinical knowledge or patient-level reasoning, yet few systematically evaluate evidence-grounded epidemiological inference. We present EpiQAL, the first diagnostic benchmark for epidemiological question answering across diverse diseases, comprising three subsets built from open-access literature. The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere. EpiQAL provides fine-grained diagnostic signals for evidence grounding, inferential reasoning, and conclusion reconstruction.

Motivation: 自动提示优化依赖小的评估子集上的任务性能作为反馈信号，但评估子集选择常被视为实现细节，需进行研究。

Method: 提出SESS，将选择问题构建为最大化目标集合函数，证明在温和条件下其具有单调和子模性，可进行有理论保证的贪心选择。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和GPQA - Diamond上，子模选择的评估子集能产生比随机或启发式基线更好的优化提示。

Conclusion: 从原则性角度研究评估子集选择问题，SESS方法可有效提升提示优化效果。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization reduces manual prompt engineering, but relies on task performance measured on a small, often randomly sampled evaluation subset as its main source of feedback signal. Despite this, how to select that evaluation subset is usually treated as an implementation detail. We study evaluation subset selection for prompt optimization from a principled perspective and propose SESS, a submodular evaluation subset selection method. We frame selection as maximizing an objective set function and show that, under mild conditions, it is monotone and submodular, enabling greedy selection with theoretical guarantees. Across GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA-Diamond, submodularly selected evaluation subsets can yield better optimized prompts than random or heuristic baselines.

Motivation: 依赖验证困惑度监测大语言模型监督微调训练往往不足，难以区分风格模仿与真实事实内化。

Method: 引入KR - Test评估框架，利用自动生成的对比示例衡量正确与错误延续的可能性偏好，通过“盲 vs 神谕”基线分析验证框架完整性。

Result: 分析了Low - Rank Adaptation (LoRA)训练动态，揭示了语言收敛与知识保留的细粒度分离。

Conclusion: KR - Test增强了微调动态的可解释性。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for injecting domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, relying on validation perplexity to monitor training is often insufficient, as it confounds stylistic mimicry with genuine factual internalization. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge Retention (KR) Test , a lightweight, corpus-grounded evaluation framework designed to distinguish factual learning from linguistics. KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a "blind vs. oracle" baseline analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities of KR-Test by analyzing the training dynamics of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). By exposing the fine-grained dissociation between linguistic convergence and knowledge retention, KR-Test enhances the interpretability of fine-tuning dynamics.

Motivation: 大推理模型推理路径长带来不必要计算和延迟，现有加速方法昂贵或对输入和提示敏感，需要更轻量级的高效推理方法。

Method: 提出Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM)，先构建模式标记校准集为查询分配推理模式，再通过特征对齐优化分层合并系数，对比目标使合并模型远离未选模型。

Result: 在七个常用推理基准测试中，RPAM大幅降低推理成本，同时保持了较强性能。

Conclusion: 模型合并可作为高效推理的轻量级替代方案，RPAM是有效的方法。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.

Motivation: 解决现有预测大语言模型输出质量方法依赖外部分类器，存在上下文窗口有限、表示能力受限和额外计算开销等问题。

Method: 引入仅对自省标记激活的标记条件LoRA，让模型学习预测输出质量，同时保留原骨干行为，避免使用外部评估器。

Result: 在问答基准测试中，应用于Qwen3 8B的IntroLM成功预测的ROC AUC达90%，比DeBERTa分类器高14%；集成到多模型路由系统中，在相同可靠性下，降低延迟达33%，减少大模型使用达50%。

Conclusion: IntroLM方法能有效预测大语言模型输出质量，且在多模型路由系统中有出色的性价比。

Abstract: A major challenge for the operation of large language models (LLMs) is how to predict whether a specific LLM will produce sufficiently high-quality output for a given query. Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.

Method: 引入Mem - Gallery基准测试，构建基于该数据集的系统评估框架，从三个功能维度评估关键记忆能力。

Result: 对十三个记忆系统进行广泛基准测试，发现明确多模态信息保留和记忆组织的必要性、记忆推理和知识管理的持续局限性以及当前模型的效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: 强调需要更好的方法来解决多模态长期对话记忆评估中的问题，提高MLLM代理的长期记忆能力。

Abstract: Long-term memory is a critical capability for multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, particularly in conversational settings where information accumulates and evolves over time. However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on multi-hop reasoning, yet how they internally compose multiple facts remains unclear. Recent work proposes \emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge. Code is available at https://github.com/laquabe/Layer-Order-Inversion.

Motivation: 现有评估常孤立衡量隐私态度或共享意愿，难以确定模型表达的价值观能否像人类行为一样共同预测下游数据共享行为。

Method: 引入基于上下文的评估协议，使用多组结构方程模型（MGSEM）分析关系，提出价值 - 行动一致性率（VAAR）指标。

Result: 在多个大语言模型中观察到稳定但特定于模型的隐私 - 亲社会 - 数据共享接受度概况，以及价值 - 行动一致性的显著异质性。

Conclusion: 该评估方法能有效分析大语言模型在数据共享决策中的价值 - 行动一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate decision-making tasks involving personal data sharing, where privacy concerns and prosocial motivations can push choices in opposite directions. Existing evaluations often measure privacy-related attitudes or sharing intentions in isolation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a model's expressed values jointly predict its downstream data-sharing actions as in real human behaviors. We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs. Across multiple LLMs, we observe stable but model-specific Privacy-PSA-AoDS profiles, and substantial heterogeneity in value-action alignment.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in police operations is growing, yet an evaluation framework tailored to police operations remains absent. While LLM's responses may not always be legally incorrect, their unverified use still can lead to severe issues such as unlawful arrests and improper evidence collection. To address this, we propose PAS (Police Action Scenarios), a systematic framework covering the entire evaluation process. Applying this framework, we constructed a novel QA dataset from over 8,000 official documents and established key metrics validated through statistical analysis with police expert judgements. Experimental results show that commercial LLMs struggle with our new police-related tasks, particularly in providing fact-based recommendations. This study highlights the necessity of an expandable evaluation framework to ensure reliable AI-driven police operations. We release our data and prompt template.

Result: 在多个跨文化基准数据集上的实验表明，CALM始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CALM框架能有效赋予语言模型文化自我意识，在跨文化任务上表现更好。

Abstract: Cultural awareness in language models is the capacity to understand and adapt to diverse cultural contexts. However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型在开放域问答推理通常为线性且逻辑不一致，现有方法如CoT呈线性文本形式，会导致结论不一致，且缺乏对模型自身图结构推理的探索，因此探索图结构推理。

Method: 提出Self - Graph Reasoning (SGR)框架使大模型在给出最终答案前将推理过程表示为结构化图，构建图结构推理数据集用于模型训练。

Result: 在五个问答基准测试上，SGR持续提高推理一致性，比基础模型提升17.74%，基于SGR微调的LLaMA - 3.3 - 70B模型表现与GPT - 4o相当，超Claude - 3.5 - Haiku。

Conclusion: 图结构推理方法有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.

Abstract: Bikeability assessment is essential for advancing sustainable urban transportation and creating cyclist-friendly cities, and it requires incorporating users' perceptions of safety and comfort. Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution.

Abstract: We introduce EPAG, a benchmark dataset and framework designed for Evaluating the Pre-consultation Ability of LLMs using diagnostic Guidelines. LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: NeuronScope框架在处理大语言模型神经元多语义解释方面有效，优于现有单遍方法

Abstract: Neuron-level interpretation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally challenged by widespread polysemanticity, where individual neurons respond to multiple distinct semantic concepts. Existing single-pass interpretation methods struggle to faithfully capture such multi-concept behavior. In this work, we propose NeuronScope, a multi-agent framework that reformulates neuron interpretation as an iterative, activation-guided process. NeuronScope explicitly deconstructs neuron activations into atomic semantic components, clusters them into distinct semantic modes, and iteratively refines each explanation using neuron activation feedback. Experiments demonstrate that NeuronScope uncovers hidden polysemanticity and produces explanations with significantly higher activation correlation compared to single-pass baselines.

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.

Result: 选择相关性得分能预测示例集对模型预测的支持或破坏作用，常见选择策略通常不如随机选择。

Conclusion: 提出平衡影响和代表性的选择策略，能更好利用选择预算。

Abstract: Training data influence estimation methods quantify the contribution of training documents to a model's output, making them a promising source of information for example-based explanations. As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.

Conclusion: STEPS框架能有效解决组合泛化的数据瓶颈问题，提升相关系统的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based systems often struggle with compositional generalization due to a data bottleneck in which complex skill combinations follow a long-tailed, power-law distribution, limiting both instruction-following performance and generalization in agent-centric tasks. To address this challenge, we propose STEPS, a Skill Taxonomy guided Entropy-based Post-training data Synthesis framework for generating compositionally challenging data. STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations.

Motivation: 大语言模型在数学问题解决中逻辑推理能力有限，CoT - SFT无法显著减少逻辑关系理解错误。

Method: 提出First - Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR) 轻量级训练框架，针对逻辑关系理解，通过训练孤立的第一步规划步骤为模型提供明确监督。

Result: FSLR在分布内和分布外设置下均优于CoT - SFT，平均分别提升3.2%和4.6%，训练速度快4 - 6倍，训练令牌消耗减少超80%。

Conclusion: FSLR能有效提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力，在性能和训练效率上有优势。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited logical reasoning abilities in mathematical problem-solving, instead often relying on pattern-matching and memorization. We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\% and 4.6\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\%.

Motivation: 现有早期退出策略在推理过程中KV缓存成为瓶颈，限制早期退出优势。

Method: 提出ADEPT方法，采用自适应令牌级早期退出机制，根据令牌复杂度动态调整计算，并解耦跳过层的顺序依赖以优化KV生成过程。

Result: 在语言生成任务中效率提高达25%，下游分类任务速度提升4倍，性能提高达45%。

Conclusion: ADEPT能有效克服早期退出策略瓶颈，在不影响性能的情况下提升计算效率。

Abstract: The inference of large language models imposes significant computational workloads, often requiring the processing of billions of parameters. Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.

Abstract: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source large language models (LLMs) is largely attributed to disparities in access to high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data. Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework empowers open-source models across multiple scales, enabling them to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the major deep research benchmark. This work provides a scalable and effective pathway for advancing open-source LLMs without relying on proprietary data or models.

Motivation: 大语言模型在知识与外部检索的上下文冲突时，常依赖内置信息，产生不忠实输出，需要改进其上下文忠实度。

Method: 引入轻量级的激活引导方法ContextFocus，无需模型微调，推理时开销极小。

Result: 在ConFiQA基准上评估，与多个强基线方法对比，结果显示显著提高了上下文忠实度，且与提示策略互补，在更大模型上也有效。

Conclusion: ContextFocus在提高大语言模型输出的上下文忠实度方面具有有效性、稳健性和高效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of parametric knowledge during pre-training. As world knowledge evolves, effective deployment increasingly depends on their ability to faithfully follow externally retrieved context. When such evidence conflicts with the model's internal knowledge, LLMs often default to memorized facts, producing unfaithful outputs. In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness. Our results highlight the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of ContextFocus in improving contextual-faithfulness of LLM outputs.

Method: 覆盖1080种提示中不同个性化方面的组合，用16种不同语言模型生成共17280篇文本进行分析。

Result: 不同语言在针对人口群体和社交媒体平台进行个性化时，生成文本的个性化质量有差异；平台个性化对生成文本可检测性影响更大，英语中个性化质量最高。

Conclusion: 跨语言研究揭示了大语言模型个性化能力在不同语言中的特点及对文本可检测性的影响。

Abstract: Capabilities of large language models to generate multilingual coherent text have continuously enhanced in recent years, which opens concerns about their potential misuse. Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages. Personalization towards platforms affects detectability of the generated texts in a higher scale, especially in English, where the personalization quality is the highest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在多任务中会犯错且重复，收集大规模自然语言解释不可行，需用少量解释示例改进模型。

Method: 使用基于嵌入的聚类选择代表性模型错误，验证相关解释能纠正错误，将解释总结成提示前缀，推理时前置到输入。

Result: 在 CounterBench、GSM8K 和 ReasonIF 数据集评估，FLEx 始终优于 CoT 提示，最多减少 83%的 CoT 残余错误。

Conclusion: FLEx 方法能有效改进模型行为，避免新输入出现类似错误，且无需修改模型权重。

Abstract: Language models have become effective at a wide range of tasks, from math problem solving to open-domain question answering. However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\% of CoT's remaining errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数大语言模型代理内存系统无法保存人类 - 代理对话中的主题连续性，现有设计存在破坏叙事和因果流、偏向词汇相似性等问题。

Method: 引入以Topic Loom为核心的分层内存架构membox，用滑动窗口监控对话，将同主题对话分组为“记忆盒”，再由Trace Weaver将密封盒连接成长程事件时间线追踪。

Result: 在LoCoMo实验中，Membox在时间推理任务上F1值最多提升68%，优于竞争基线，且使用的上下文令牌更少。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模主题连续性，Membox为提高大语言模型代理的连贯性和效率提供了一种认知驱动机制。

Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.

Result: 构建了覆盖16种语言、75个翻译方向的数据集，开发搜索工具用于训练和评估。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法能助力提升新词感知机器翻译的质量。

Abstract: Neologism-aware machine translation aims to translate source sentences containing neologisms into target languages. This field remains underexplored compared with general machine translation (MT). In this paper, we propose an agentic framework, NeoAMT, for neologism-aware machine translation using a Wiktionary search tool. Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修正大语言模型记忆评估方法，解决将PII重建成功解释为记忆证据的问题，在低词汇提示条件下评估PII泄漏。

Method: 将CRM形式化为提示控制评估框架，进行跨32种语言和多种记忆范式的大规模多语言PII泄漏重新评估，研究基于重建的设置、无提示生成和成员推理。

Result: 基于重建设置的有效性主要由直接表面形式提示驱动，控制提示后重建成功率大幅降低，无提示生成和成员推理的真阳性率极低。

Conclusion: 之前报告的PII泄漏更宜用提示驱动行为解释，提示控制评估对可靠量化大语言模型中与隐私相关的记忆很重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to "leak" Personally Identifiable Information (PII), with successful PII reconstruction often interpreted as evidence of memorization. We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.

Conclusion: transformer模型中意义的位置反映了方法选择和架构约束之间的相互作用。

Abstract: Understanding where transformer language models encode psychologically meaningful aspects of meaning is essential for both theory and practice. We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning "lives" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has led to an increase in AI-generated text, with students increasingly using LLM-generated content as their own work, which violates academic integrity. This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.

Conclusion: 集成推理和自我反思机制对安全对齐有显著优势，训练阶段应将安全作为明确约束或核心优化目标，需对文本完成接口等采取架构和部署保障措施。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.

Abstract: We introduce Arctic-ABSA, a collection of powerful models for real-life aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our models are tailored to commercial needs, trained on a large corpus of public data alongside carefully generated synthetic data, resulting in a dataset 20 times larger than SemEval14. We extend typical ABSA models by expanding the number of sentiment classes from the standard three (positive, negative, neutral) to five, adding mixed and unknown classes, while also jointly predicting overall text sentiment and supporting multiple languages. We experiment with reasoning injection by fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples and introduce a novel reasoning pretraining technique for encoder-only models that significantly improves downstream fine-tuning and generalization. Our 395M-parameter encoder and 8B-parameter decoder achieve up to 10 percentage points higher accuracy than GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, while setting new state-of-the-art results on the SemEval14 benchmark. A single multilingual model maintains 87-91% accuracy across six languages without degrading English performance. We release ABSA-mix, a large-scale benchmark aggregating 17 public ABSA datasets across 92 domains.

Motivation: 以往研究未明确位置偏差在各层和输入位置的演变，以及与任务复杂度无关的变化情况，因此开展研究。

Method: 引入基于归因的框架，使用层电导和滑动窗口方法量化各层在输入位置上的重要性分布。

Result: 位置重要性分布有架构特异性、跨输入稳定、对词汇打乱不变；存在随深度增加的近期偏差和随深度减弱的首因偏差；早期层更重视实词，后期层失去词类型区分。

Conclusion: 通过新框架分析出语言模型中位置效应的特点和词类型权重的层间差异。

Abstract: Language models often show a preference for using information from specific positions in the input regardless of semantic relevance. While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.

Conclusion: 提出的InfiniteWeb系统有效。

Abstract: GUI agents that interact with graphical interfaces on behalf of users represent a promising direction for practical AI assistants. However, training such agents is hindered by the scarcity of suitable environments. We present InfiniteWeb, a system that automatically generates functional web environments at scale for GUI agent training. While LLMs perform well on generating a single webpage, building a realistic and functional website with many interconnected pages faces challenges. We address these challenges through unified specification, task-centric test-driven development, and a combination of website seed with reference design image to ensure diversity. Our system also generates verifiable task evaluators enabling dense reward signals for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that InfiniteWeb surpasses commercial coding agents at realistic website construction, and GUI agents trained on our generated environments achieve significant performance improvements on OSWorld and Online-Mind2Web, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算子学习模型需大量配对数据集，且在尖锐特征处表现不佳，旨在解决含间断系数和非光滑解的参数偏微分方程求解问题。

Method: 结合间断Galerkin方法和神经网络，用对称内罚Galerkin（SIPG）方案最小化基于DG的弱形式残差，通过神经网络预测元素级解系数。

Conclusion: 结合局部离散格式与机器学习，能在具有挑战性的PDE环境中实现鲁棒、能感知奇点的算子逼近。

Abstract: We introduce Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Operator Network (DG--FEONet), a data-free operator learning framework that combines the strengths of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with neural networks to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients and non-smooth solutions. Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对AI快速融入中国经济时，如何利用其增长潜力并管理其对传统资本和劳动力市场破坏效应的治理挑战。

Method: 在Lotka - Volterra捕食者 - 猎物框架下建模AI资本、实物资本和劳动力之间动态互动，用2016 - 2023年中国年度数据，量化互动强度、确定稳定均衡点并进行全局敏感性分析。

Result: AI资本作为‘猎物’刺激实物资本积累和劳动报酬，面临弱约束反馈；平衡点是稳定节点；劳动力市场均衡主要由AI相关参数驱动，实物资本均衡受自身饱和动态影响。

Conclusion: 为政策制定者校准AI推广政策、预见并缓解监管结构刚性、促进AI与传统经济互补增长及收益分配提供定量基础。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into China's economy presents a classic governance challenge: how to harness its growth potential while managing its disruptive effects on traditional capital and labor markets. This study addresses this policy dilemma by modeling the dynamic interactions between AI capital, physical capital, and labor within a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey framework. Using annual Chinese data (2016-2023), we quantify the interaction strengths, identify stable equilibria, and perform a global sensitivity analysis. Our results reveal a consistent pattern where AI capital acts as the 'prey', stimulating both physical capital accumulation and labor compensation (wage bill), while facing only weak constraining feedback. The equilibrium points are stable nodes, indicating a policy-mediated convergence path rather than volatile cycles. Critically, the sensitivity analysis shows that the labor market equilibrium is overwhelmingly driven by AI-related parameters, whereas the physical capital equilibrium is also influenced by its own saturation dynamics. These findings provide a systemic, quantitative basis for policymakers: (1) to calibrate AI promotion policies by recognizing the asymmetric leverage points in capital vs. labor markets; (2) to anticipate and mitigate structural rigidities that may arise from current regulatory settings; and (3) to prioritize interventions that foster complementary growth between AI and traditional economic structures while ensuring broad-base distribution of technological gains.

Result: 发现人工智能采用与技能组合扩展存在因果关系，明确两大作用机制，且显著增加对‘前瞻性’技能的需求。

Conclusion: 人工智能在稳定当前招聘信息和推动主动适应未来技能转变方面具有双重作用。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on skill requirements using 14 million online job vacancies from Chinese listed firms (2018-2022). Employing a novel Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) algorithm trained via contrastive learning and LLM-driven data augmentation, we map vacancy requirements to the ESCO framework. By benchmarking occupation-skill relationships against 2018 O*NET-ESCO mappings, we document a robust causal relationship between AI adoption and the expansion of skill portfolios. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms. First, AI reduces information asymmetry in the labor market, enabling firms to specify current occupation-specific requirements with greater precision. Second, AI empowers firms to anticipate evolving labor market dynamics. We find that AI adoption significantly increases the demand for "forward-looking" skills--those absent from 2018 standards but subsequently codified in 2022 updates. This suggests that AI allows firms to lead, rather than follow, the formal evolution of occupational standards. Our findings highlight AI's dual role as both a stabilizer of current recruitment information and a catalyst for proactive adaptation to future skill shifts.

Motivation: 探讨生成式人工智能（GenAI）采用中存在显著不平等的原因。

Method: 使用英国全国代表性调查数据，构建复合指数，进行交叉分析和合成双面板设计。

Result: 风险指数能解释9 - 18%的GenAI采用差异，对各年龄段女性预测性强；年轻数字化群体中性别差距大；增强乐观情绪可提高年轻女性使用率。

Conclusion: 性别对AI社会和伦理后果的感知是GenAI采用不平等的主因，对经济有影响。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is diffusing rapidly, yet its adoption is strikingly unequal. Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现更强大的跨域泛化的WiFi手势识别

Method: 使用CSI - ratio去噪等处理原始数据；采用类对抗学习和无监督聚类挖掘潜在域因素，用对抗学习对齐潜在域

Result: 在多组设置和多数据集、真实环境中评估，相比现有方法性能最高提升78%和50%，多数跨域任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: GesFi在跨域泛化的WiFi手势识别中表现优异，有更好的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose GesFi, a novel WiFi-based gesture recognition system that introduces WiFi latent domain mining to redefine domains directly from the data itself. GesFi first processes raw sensing data collected from WiFi receivers using CSI-ratio denoising, Short-Time Fast Fourier Transform, and visualization techniques to generate standardized input representations. It then employs class-wise adversarial learning to suppress gesture semantic and leverages unsupervised clustering to automatically uncover latent domain factors responsible for distributional shifts. These latent domains are then aligned through adversarial learning to support robust cross-domain generalization. Finally, the system is applied to the target environment for robust gesture inference. We deployed GesFi under both single-pair and multi-pair settings using commodity WiFi transceivers, and evaluated it across multiple public datasets and real-world environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, GesFi achieves up to 78% and 50% performance improvements over existing adversarial methods, and consistently outperforms prior generalization approaches across most cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的理论框架可应用于自编码器提升其性能，表明GENEOs在现代机器学习应用中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.

Conclusion: 晶格等变架构可用于将凝聚态晶格系统中的微观电子过程与涌现的动力学行为联系起来。

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.

Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.

Conclusion: 非局部架构对可泛化的MLFFs是必要的，能实现大规模化学和生物系统的高保真分子动力学。

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have revolutionized molecular simulations by providing quantum mechanical accuracy at the speed of molecular mechanical computations. However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.

Result: 基于嵌入的分类器能实现近乎完美的分离，即使生成音频有高感知质量和先进指标得分。

Conclusion: 音频超分辨率模型的感知质量和真实分布保真度之间存在持续差距。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution (ADSR), producing perceptually convincing wideband audio from narrowband inputs. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on signal-level or perceptual metrics, leaving open the question of how closely the distributions of synthetic super-resolved and real wideband audio match. Here we address this problem by analyzing the separability of real and super-resolved audio in various embedding spaces. We consider both middle-band ($4\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.

Motivation: 现有零样本 TTS 模型合成期望风格语音需精心选参考音频，可控 TTS 方法不支持连续和参考相对风格控制。

Method: 引入解耦无分类器引导（DCFG）独立控制文本和参考引导，使用特定风格 LoRA 和正交 LoRA 融合实现连续解耦多属性控制，引入音色一致性优化模块缓解音色漂移。

Result: ReStyle-TTS 能对音高、能量和多种情感进行用户友好、连续和相对的控制，同时保持可懂度和说话人音色，在不匹配参考 - 目标风格场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ReStyle-TTS 有效解决零样本 TTS 风格控制问题，实现连续和参考相对的风格控制。

Abstract: Zero-shot text-to-speech models can clone a speaker's timbre from a short reference audio, but they also strongly inherit the speaking style present in the reference. As a result, synthesizing speech with a desired style often requires carefully selecting reference audio, which is impractical when only limited or mismatched references are available. While recent controllable TTS methods attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on absolute style targets and discrete textual prompts, and therefore do not support continuous and reference-relative style control. We propose ReStyle-TTS, a framework that enables continuous and reference-relative style control in zero-shot TTS. Our key insight is that effective style control requires first reducing the model's implicit dependence on reference style before introducing explicit control mechanisms. To this end, we introduce Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), which independently controls text and reference guidance, reducing reliance on reference style while preserving text fidelity. On top of this, we apply style-specific LoRAs together with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion to enable continuous and disentangled multi-attribute control, and introduce a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to mitigate timbre drift caused by weakened reference guidance. Experiments show that ReStyle-TTS enables user-friendly, continuous, and relative control over pitch, energy, and multiple emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre, and performs robustly in challenging mismatched reference-target style scenarios.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning frameworks rely on extensive labeled datasets for robust performance on real-world tasks. However, there is a lack of large annotated datasets in audio and music domains, as annotating such recordings is resource-intensive, laborious, and often require expert domain knowledge. In this work, we explore the use of label propagation (LP), a graph-based semi-supervised learning technique, for automatically labeling the unlabeled set in an unsupervised manner. By constructing a similarity graph over audio embeddings, we propagate limited label information from a small annotated subset to a larger unlabeled corpus in a transductive, semi-supervised setting. We apply this method to two tasks in Indian Art Music (IAM): Raga identification and Instrument classification. For both these tasks, we integrate multiple public datasets along with additional recordings we acquire from Prasar Bharati Archives to perform LP. Our experiments demonstrate that LP significantly reduces labeling overhead and produces higher-quality annotations compared to conventional baseline methods, including those based on pretrained inductive models. These results highlight the potential of graph-based semi-supervised learning to democratize data annotation and accelerate progress in music information retrieval.

TL;DR: pintervals包提供统一框架构建预测区间和校准预测，可跨不同建模框架和应用使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有构建预测区间的R包和函数常针对特定建模框架或预测类型，或需手动定制，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提供模型无关的统一接口，包含构建共形、参数和自助法预测区间的例程。

Result: 实现了pintervals包，可用于不同建模框架和应用。

Conclusion: pintervals包能让研究人员在不同建模框架和应用中应用和比较多种预测区间构建方法。

Abstract: The \pkg{pintervals} package aims to provide a unified framework for constructing prediction intervals and calibrating predictions in a model-agnostic setting using set-aside calibration data. It comprises routines to construct conformal as well as parametric and bootstrapped prediction intervals from any model that outputs point predictions. Several R packages and functions already exist for constructing prediction intervals, but they often focus on specific modeling frameworks or types of predictions, or require manual customization for different models or applications. By providing a consistent interface for a variety of prediction interval construction approaches (all model-agnostic), \pkg{pintervals} allows researchers to apply and compare them across different modeling frameworks and applications.

Motivation: 智能辅导系统可靠评估自由形式数学推理仍有挑战。

Method: 使用大语言模型的模块化工作流，配置可读可编辑，允许预计算或教师注入中间步骤。

Result: 评估反馈质量与人类专家相当，在更具挑战性的测试中有差距也有成功。

Conclusion: 系统能处理自由形式输入，评估反馈质量较好且已集成到平台。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have long enabled automated immediate feedback on student work when it is presented in a tightly structured format and when problems are very constrained, but reliably assessing free-form mathematical reasoning remains challenging.
  We present a system that processes free-form natural language input, handles a wide range of edge cases, and comments competently not only on the technical correctness of submitted proofs, but also on style and presentation issues. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the evaluation of such a system, and show that by the metrics we evaluate, the quality of the feedback generated is comparable to that produced by human experts when assessing early undergraduate homework. We stress-test our system with a small set of more advanced and unusual questions, and report both significant gaps and encouraging successes in that more challenging setting.
  Our system uses large language models in a modular workflow. The workflow configuration is human-readable and editable without programming knowledge, and allows some intermediate steps to be precomputed or injected by the instructor.
  A version of our tool is deployed on the Imperial mathematics homework platform Lambdafeedback. We report also on the integration of our tool into this platform.

TL;DR: 工程教育面临双重挑战，本文研究AI聊天机器人能否促进学生掌握知识而非仅提供信息，发现学生接受其解决技术问题，但对其道德等判断能力存疑，建议构建融合人类智慧和AI的辅导框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程教育中传统学徒模式受冲击，生成式AI兴起，引发关于AI和认知哲学问题，探讨AI聊天机器人能否有效辅导。

Method: 综合数十年关于专业知识、隐性知识和人机交互的批判性观点，开展混合方法研究，涉及75名学生和7名教师。

Result: 参与者接受AI用于技术问题解决，但对其道德、情感和情境判断能力存疑，教师更关注风险，隐私是关键要求。

Conclusion: 生成式AI虽能提供认知和程序支持，但无法复制人类指导的价值维度，提议构建融合人类智慧和AI的多重辅导框架。

Abstract: Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.

Abstract: The development of more powerful Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has expanded its capabilities and the variety of outputs. This has introduced significant legal challenges, including gray areas in various legal systems, such as the assessment of criminal liability for those responsible for these models. Therefore, we conducted a multidisciplinary study utilizing the statutory interpretation of relevant German laws, which, in conjunction with scenarios, provides a perspective on the different properties of GenAI in the context of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) generation. We found that generating CSAM with GenAI may have criminal and legal consequences not only for the user committing the primary offense but also for individuals responsible for the models, such as independent software developers, researchers, and company representatives. Additionally, the assessment of criminal liability may be affected by contextual and technical factors, including the type of generated image, content moderation policies, and the model's intended purpose. Based on our findings, we discussed the implications for different roles, as well as the requirements when developing such systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 系统评估14种病理基础模型对扫描器诱导变异性的鲁棒性，发现当前模型对扫描器导致的域转移不具不变性，开发和评估模型需超越以准确率为中心的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管病理基础模型（PFMs）在基准测试中表现良好，但对现实世界中扫描器设备等技术域转移的鲁棒性仍不清楚。

Method: 使用多扫描器数据集隔离扫描器影响，通过无监督嵌入分析和临床病理监督预测任务评估鲁棒性。

Result: 当前PFMs对扫描器诱导的域转移不具不变性，多数模型在嵌入空间中编码了明显的扫描器特定变异性，鲁棒性与训练数据规模、模型大小或新颖度无关，多样化数据训练的模型在下游监督任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PFMs的开发和评估需要超越以准确率为中心的基准测试，明确评估和优化嵌入稳定性和校准。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have become central to computational pathology, aiming to offer general encoders for feature extraction from whole-slide images (WSIs). Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.

TL;DR: 针对计算昂贵正向模型的逆问题，提出期望后验（EP）作为不确定性感知后验近似的通用基线，分析期望未归一化后验（EUP）与EP的偏差，还提出RKpCN算法用于实际EP近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝叶斯推理方案对计算昂贵正向模型的逆问题不可行，常用替代模型，但需传播其不确定性，且对现有不确定性传播方法差异了解不足。

Method: 提出期望后验（EP）作为基线，分析期望未归一化后验（EUP）与EP的偏差，提出随机核预条件Crank - Nicolson（RKpCN）算法。

Result: 当替代模型不确定性在设计空间高度不均匀时，EUP启发式方法可能失效，如对数似然由高斯过程模拟时。

Conclusion: 期望后验（EP）可作为不确定性感知后验近似的通用基线，RKpCN算法可在涉及无限维高斯过程替代模型的具有挑战性的环境中提供实际的EP近似。

Abstract: Standard Bayesian inference schemes are infeasible for inverse problems with computationally expensive forward models. A common solution is to replace the model with a cheaper surrogate. To avoid overconfident conclusions, it is essential to acknowledge the surrogate approximation by propagating its uncertainty. At present, a variety of distinct uncertainty propagation methods have been suggested, with little understanding of how they vary. To fill this gap, we propose a mixture distribution termed the expected posterior (EP) as a general baseline for uncertainty-aware posterior approximation, justified by decision theoretic and modular Bayesian inference arguments. We then investigate the expected unnormalized posterior (EUP), a popular heuristic alternative, analyzing when it may deviate from the EP baseline. Our results show that this heuristic can break down when the surrogate uncertainty is highly non-uniform over the design space, as can be the case when the log-likelihood is emulated by a Gaussian process. Finally, we present the random kernel preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (RKpCN) algorithm, an approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme that provides practical EP approximation in the challenging setting involving infinite-dimensional Gaussian process surrogates.

Method: 假设两个群体，用卡方检验样本量近似公式，非参数估计误差率，对比其他常用统计量。

Result: 提出的衡量方法与其他两种常用统计量本质不同，能对算法偏差进行不同排序。

Conclusion: 该衡量方法有优势，部分理想特性源于方法本身，有望用于多群体复杂场景。

Abstract: We propose the use of a simple intuitive principle for measuring algorithmic classification bias: the significance of the differences in a classifier's error rates across the various demographics is inversely commensurate with the sample size required to statistically detect them. That is, if large sample sizes are required to statistically establish biased behavior, the algorithm is less biased, and vice versa. In a simple setting, we assume two distinct demographics, and non-parametric estimates of the error rates on them, e1 and e2, respectively. We use a well-known approximate formula for the sample size of the chi-squared test, and verify some basic desirable properties of the proposed measure. Next, we compare the proposed measure with two other commonly used statistics, the difference e2-e1 and the ratio e2/e1 of the error rates. We establish that the proposed measure is essentially different in that it can rank algorithms for bias differently, and we discuss some of its advantages over the other two measures. Finally, we briefly discuss how some of the desirable properties of the proposed measure emanate from fundamental characteristics of the method, rather than the approximate sample size formula we used, and thus, are expected to hold in more complex settings with more than two demographics.

Result: 实现支持插入、删除和查询操作，最坏情况各操作时间复杂度为O(n)，平均时间复杂度为O(log(n))。

Abstract: We present an approach to implement binary search trees in the rule-based graph programming language GP 2. Our implementation uses GP 2's rooted graph transformation rules to be fast and supports insertion, deletion and query operations. We argue that the worst-case runtime for each of the operations is O(n) for a tree with n nodes. In addition, we expect that, on average, the operations run in time O(log(n)). Hence the implementation would match the time complexity of binary search trees implementations in imperative languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on code completion tasks in general-purpose programming languages. However, existing repository-level code completion benchmarks focus almost exclusively on software code and largely overlook hardware description languages. In this work, we present \textbf{MHRC-Bench}, consisting of \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Train} and \textbf{MHRC-Bench-Eval}, the first benchmark designed for multilingual hardware code completion at the repository level. Our benchmark targets completion tasks and covers three major hardware design coding styles. Each completion target is annotated with code-structure-level and hardware-oriented semantic labels derived from concrete syntax tree analysis. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of models on MHRC-Bench-Eval. Comprehensive evaluation results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of MHRC-Bench.

Result: 在CodeContests+数据集上的实验表明，CSSG在单语言和跨语言设置下，在区分代码相似度方面始终优于现有指标。

Conclusion: 依赖感知图表示为基于表层或语法的相似度度量提供了更有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Existing code similarity metrics, such as BLEU, CodeBLEU, and TSED, largely rely on surface-level string overlap or abstract syntax tree structures, and often fail to capture deeper semantic relationships between programs.We propose CSSG (Code Similarity using Semantic Graphs), a novel metric that leverages program dependence graphs to explicitly model control dependencies and variable interactions, providing a semantics-aware representation of code.Experiments on the CodeContests+ dataset show that CSSG consistently outperforms existing metrics in distinguishing more similar code from less similar code under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings, demonstrating that dependency-aware graph representations offer a more effective alternative to surface-level or syntax-based similarity measures.

Conclusion: 更严谨动态的叙事建模方法有价值，所提算法框架有效。

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithmic framework for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLRs), designed to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and selection quality assessment in the literature review process. The proposed method integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools to automate and structure the selection and analysis of academic publications. The framework is applied to a case study focused on financial narratives, an emerging area in financial economics that examines how structured accounts of economic events, formed by the convergence of individual interpretations, influence market dynamics and asset prices. Drawing from the Scopus database of peer-reviewed literature, the review highlights research efforts to model financial narratives using various NLP techniques. Results reveal that while advances have been made, the conceptualization of financial narratives remains fragmented, often reduced to sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or their combination, without a unified theoretical framework. The findings underscore the value of more rigorous and dynamic narrative modeling approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic SLR methodology.

TL;DR: 项目自2025年11月开展，至2026年1月自动形式化了 Munkres 教材中大部分一般拓扑内容，成本低且进度快，认为2026年形式化将变简单和普遍。


<details>

Motivation: 实现对一般拓扑学内容的自动形式化，探索形式化过程的高效低成本方法。

Method: 在大语言模型和证明检查器之间建立长期反馈循环，使用特定的LLM（如 ChatGPT、Claude Sonnet）、证明检查器（Megalodon）和核心库进行形式化，辅以提示工程。

Result: 在约两个月内生成160k行形式化拓扑内容，包含多个重要定理证明，超1.5k个引理/定理，成本约100美元。

Conclusion: 无论使用何种证明辅助工具，（自动）形式化在2026年可能会变得容易且普遍。

Abstract: This is a brief description of a project that has already autoformalized a large portion of the general topology from the Munkres textbook (which has in total 241 pages in 7 chapters and 39 sections). The project has been running since November 21, 2025 and has as of January 4, 2026, produced 160k lines of formalized topology. Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \$100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems). The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library. The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc). The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here. Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.

Motivation: 传统的正常逻辑程序语义有一定局限性，为了提供一种新的、全面的理解程序行为的方法，需要推广陷阱空间概念。

Method: 将陷阱空间概念从Datalog¬程序推广到任意正常逻辑程序，建立新语义的基础性质并与现有语义建立联系。

Result: 陷阱空间语义同时具有模型论和动力学特征，能提供统一精确的框架证明支持类、严格稳定支持类和正则模型的存在性，并揭示现有语义间的深层关系。

Conclusion: 陷阱空间语义是理解正常逻辑程序语义的有效新方法，提供了统一且精确的框架。

Abstract: The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.

Abstract: We present automated theorem provers for the first-order logic of here and there (HT). They are based on a native sequent calculus for the logic of HT and an axiomatic embedding of the logic of HT into intuitionistic logic. The analytic proof search in the sequent calculus is optimized by using free variables and skolemization. The embedding is used in combination with sequent, tableau and connection calculi for intuitionistic first-order logic. All provers are evaluated on a large benchmark set of first-order formulas, providing a foundation for the development of more efficient HT provers.

Abstract: We present a systematic framework of indices designed to characterize Large Language Model (LLM) responses when challenged with rebuttals during a chat. Assessing how LLMs respond to user dissent is crucial for understanding their reliability and behavior patterns, yet the complexity of human-LLM interactions makes systematic evaluation challenging. Our approach employs a fictitious-response rebuttal method that quantifies LLM behavior when presented with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges to their fictitious previous response. The indices are specifically designed to detect and measure what could be characterized as sycophantic behavior (excessive agreement with user challenges) or stubborn responses (rigid adherence to the fictitious response in the chat history) from LLMs. These metrics allow investigation of the relationships between sycophancy, stubbornness, and the model's actual mastery of the subject matter. We demonstrate the utility of these indices using two physics problems as test scenarios with various OpenAI models. The framework is intentionally generalizable to any multiple-choice format question, including on topics without universally accepted correct answers. Our results reveal measurable differences across OpenAI model generations, with trends indicating that newer models and those employing greater "Reasoning Effort" exhibit reduced sycophantic behavior. The FR pairing method combined with our proposed indices provides a practical, adaptable toolkit for systematically comparing LLM dialogue behaviors across different models and contexts.

Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.

Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.

Abstract: Effectively encoding inequality constraints is a primary obstacle in applying quantum algorithms to financial optimization. A quantum model for Markowitz portfolio optimization is presented that resolves this by embedding slack variables directly into the problem Hamiltonian. The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become a fundamental tool for large-scale learning systems; however, most existing methods rely on the classical Lipschitz smoothness assumption, which is often violated in problems with rapidly varying gradients. Motivated by this limitation, we study decentralized optimization under the generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness framework, in which the Hessian norm is allowed to grow linearly with the gradient norm, thereby accommodating rapidly varying gradients beyond classical Lipschitz smoothness. We integrate gradient-tracking techniques with gradient clipping and carefully design the clipping threshold to ensure accurate convergence over directed communication graphs under generalized smoothness. In contrast to existing distributed optimization results under generalized smoothness that require a bounded gradient dissimilarity assumption, our results remain valid even when the gradient dissimilarity is unbounded, making the proposed framework more applicable to realistic heterogeneous data environments. We validate our approach via numerical experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including LIBSVM and CIFAR-10, using regularized logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, demonstrating superior stability and faster convergence over existing methods.

Abstract: We consider the densest submatrix problem, which seeks the submatrix of fixed size of a given binary matrix that contains the most nonzero entries. This problem is a natural generalization of fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization, e.g., the densest subgraph, maximum clique, and maximum edge biclique problems, and has wide application the study of complex networks. Much recent research has focused on the development of sufficient conditions for exact solution of the densest submatrix problem via convex relaxation. The vast majority of these sufficient conditions establish identification of the densest submatrix within a graph containing exactly one large dense submatrix hidden by noise. The assumptions of these underlying models are not observed in real-world networks, where the data may correspond to a matrix containing many dense submatrices of varying sizes.
  We extend and generalize these results to the more realistic setting where the input matrix may contain \emph{many} large dense subgraphs. Specifically, we establish sufficient conditions under which we can expect to solve the densest submatrix problem in polynomial time for random input matrices sampled from a generalization of the stochastic block model. Moreover, we also provide sufficient conditions for perfect recovery under a deterministic adversarial. Numerical experiments involving randomly generated problem instances and real-world collaboration and communication networks are used empirically to verify the theoretical phase-transitions to perfect recovery given by these sufficient conditions.

Abstract: Optimal control of obstacle problems arises in a wide range of applications and is computationally challenging due to its nonsmoothness, nonlinearity, and bilevel structure. Classical numerical approaches rely on mesh-based discretization and typically require solving a sequence of costly subproblems. In this work, we propose a single-loop bilevel deep learning method, which is mesh-free, scalable to high-dimensional and complex domains, and avoids repeated solution of discretized subproblems. The method employs constraint-embedding neural networks to approximate the state and control and preserves the bilevel structure. To train the neural networks efficiently, we propose a Single-Loop Stochastic First-Order Bilevel Algorithm (S2-FOBA), which eliminates nested optimization and does not rely on restrictive lower-level uniqueness assumptions. We analyze the convergence behavior of S2-FOBA under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments on benchmark examples, including distributed and obstacle control problems with regular and irregular obstacles on complex domains, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to classical numerical methods.
