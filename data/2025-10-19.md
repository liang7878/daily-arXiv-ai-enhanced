### [1] [Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique): Finding Model Validity Through Decision-Maker Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13858)
*Raheleh Biglari,Joachim Denil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于决策一致性确定模型有效性的DOTechnique方法，通过高速公路换道系统示例展示其在寻找模型有效性区域的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定模型有效性的方法依赖预定义有效性框架，可能不可用或不充分，需新方法。

Method: 提出DOTechnique方法，基于决策一致性而非输出相似性确定模型有效性，集成领域约束和符号推理缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路换道系统为例，表明DOTechnique能揭示仿真模型有效性区域。

Conclusion: DOTechnique技术有潜力通过决策者上下文支持寻找模型有效性。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

### [2] [Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13979)
*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有ASR系统多依赖声学信息，本文聚焦科学演讲场景，结合幻灯片进行多模态ASR，创建基准、探索方法、数据增强，模型WER相对降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA的自动语音识别系统主要依赖声学信息，忽略多模态上下文，而视觉信息对消歧和自适应很重要，且此前工作多关注说话者图像，本文关注科学演讲场景下结合幻灯片。

Method: 创建多模态演讲基准，探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法，采用合适的数据增强方法缓解带幻灯片数据集不足问题，用增强后的数据集训练模型。

Result: 与基线模型相比，所有单词的字错误率相对降低约34%，特定领域术语的字错误率相对降低35%。

Conclusion: 在科学演讲场景下，结合幻灯片等多模态信息能有效提升自动语音识别系统的性能，降低字错误率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

### [3] [Do Large Language Models Show Biases in Causal Learning? Insights from Contingency Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13985)
*María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Francisca Gauna Selasco,Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini,Mario Alejandro Leiva,Gerardo I. Simari,María Vanina Martinez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究检查大语言模型在应急判断任务中是否易产生因果错觉，发现模型易有此错觉，支持其只复制因果语言而非真正理解的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果学习易产生如因果错觉的认知偏差，该偏差引发诸多社会问题，研究大语言模型是否会产生因果错觉。

Method: 构建1000个医学背景下的零应急场景数据集，让大语言模型评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，易产生因果错觉。

Conclusion: 支持大语言模型只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，对其在需要准确因果推理的领域的应用提出担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

### [4] [CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍开源进化编码代理CodeEvolve，结合大语言模型与遗传算法解决复杂计算问题，评估显示其性能超AlphaEvolve并开源框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂计算问题，结合进化概念与大语言模型。

Method: 采用基于岛屿的遗传算法，引入基于灵感的交叉机制，实施元提示策略。

Result: 在部分数学基准测试中，CodeEvolve性能超过AlphaEvolve。

Conclusion: CodeEvolve有效，开源框架可促进合作与进步。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

### [5] [GammaZero: Learning To Guide POMDP Belief Space Search With Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14035)
*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GammaZero框架用于POMDP规划，基于图表示实现跨问题规模泛化，实验显示有良好性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POMDP规划方法需特定领域架构且扩展性差，希望找到能跨问题规模泛化的方法。

Method: 将信念状态转换为以动作中心的图，用带解码器的图神经网络从专家演示中学习价值函数和策略，再用学习到的启发式方法指导蒙特卡罗树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在相同规模问题上与BetaZero性能相当，能零样本泛化到比训练问题大2 - 4倍的问题，减少搜索需求并保持解的质量。

Conclusion: GammaZero的统一图表示方法有效，能实现跨问题规模的泛化，在POMDP规划中具有优势。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

### [6] [Position: Require Frontier AI Labs To Release Small "Analog" Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14053)
*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出通过强制大型AI实验室发布小型可访问的模拟模型来平衡AI安全与创新，该政策成本低且能促进公共利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿AI模型安全监管提案因安全 - 创新权衡问题大多搁置，需新监管方法。

Method: 强制大型AI实验室发布从其最大专有模型训练和提炼出的小型、可公开访问的模拟模型。

Result: 该政策能让更广泛研究社区参与，减少监管负担，加速安全进步，成本低且利于公共利益。

Conclusion: 深入理解模型可缓解安全 - 创新权衡，实现两者兼得。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [7] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏结构以保证公平性，本文将任务建模为多目标、标记级马尔可夫决策过程，提出两种基于社会选择理论的方法，实验表明其有更好的最坏情况代理对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型共识声明生成框架在聚合不同自由形式意见时缺乏提供可证明公平性保证的固有结构问题。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、标记级马尔可夫决策过程，提出基于社会选择理论的两种方法：一是随机生成政策保证在事前核心，二是在MDP框架内使用搜索算法最大化平等主义福利。

Result: 使用语言模型实例化代理策略的实验显示，以平等主义目标引导的搜索生成的共识声明与基线方法相比，在最坏情况下的代理对齐效果有所改善。

Conclusion: 提出的基于社会选择理论的方法能有效改善大语言模型共识声明生成中的公平性和代理对齐问题。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

### [8] [STEMS: Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination for Building Energy Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14112)
*Huiliang Zhang,Di Wu,Arnaud Zinflou,Benoit Boulet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用于建筑能源协同管理的STEMS框架，实验显示其性能优于现有方法，能降本减排并保障安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑能源协同管理在利用时空依赖和保障多建筑系统安全方面面临挑战，当前系统存在信息利用不足、缺乏安全保障和系统复杂等问题。

Method: 提出STEMS框架，包含使用GCN - Transformer融合架构的时空图表示学习框架和结合控制障碍函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集实验中，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放降低，安全违规率从35.1%降至5.6%，不适比例仅0.13%，极端天气下有强鲁棒性，不同建筑类型中有效。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在建筑能源协同管理中表现优异，能有效解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

### [9] [Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14133)
*Edoardo Allegrini,Ananth Shreekumar,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对智能体AI系统通信生态碎片化问题，提出包含主机智能体模型和任务生命周期模型的建模框架，定义相关属性用于形式验证，实现系统的系统分析、设计和部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体AI系统的通信生态碎片化，存在语义差距，无法严格分析系统属性并带来风险，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入由主机智能体模型和任务生命周期模型组成的建模框架，定义相关属性并以时态逻辑表达。

Result: 能够对系统行为进行形式验证，检测协调边缘情况，防止死锁和安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 提出首个严格、与领域无关的框架，可用于智能体AI系统的系统分析、设计和部署。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

### [10] [A Multimodal Approach to Heritage Preservation in the Context of Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14136)
*David Roqui,Adèle Cormier,nistor Grozavu,Ann Bourges*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出轻量级多模态架构预测文化遗产地退化严重程度，在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上取得良好效果，证明架构简单性与对比正则化在数据稀缺的遗产监测中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测无法捕捉环境压力与材料恶化间复杂关系。

Method: 提出轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据与视觉图像，适配PerceiverIO，采用简化编码器和Adaptive Barlow Twins损失。

Result: 模型在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上准确率达76.9%，比标准多模态架构提高43%，比原始PerceiverIO提高25%；传感器单模态61.5%，图像单模态46.2%；确定最优相关目标值τ = 0.3时准确率69.2%。

Conclusion: 架构简单性与对比正则化能在数据稀缺的遗产监测中实现有效多模态学习，为人工智能驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

*Tian Liu,Alex Cann,Ian Colbert,Mehdi Saeedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章指出强化学习在商业游戏中应用慢，探讨了行为树与强化学习结合的方法，并用AMD Schola插件在复杂3D环境中创建多任务NPC进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在商业视频游戏中应用缓慢，探索行为树（BTs）与强化学习（RL）结合在游戏AI中的应用。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在虚幻引擎中，以商业游戏《最后生还者》为灵感在复杂3D环境创建多任务NPC，提供联合训练RL模型与BTs的详细方法。

Result: 展示了联合训练方法可使NPC具备多种技能，证明了BT+RL方法的可行性。

Conclusion: BT+RL的结合是值得进一步探索的方向，为游戏AI中使用RL驱动的NPC提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

### [12] [JEDA: Query-Free Clinical Order Search from Ambient Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14169)
*Praphul Singh,Corey Barrett,Sumana Srivasta,Amitabh Saikia,Irfan Bulu,Sri Gadde,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出JEDA模型，可直接检索临床订单，无查询模式能处理对话触发检索，实践中表现优异，是快速、可解释且无LLM的检索层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有依赖LLM重写的系统存在延迟、不稳定和不透明等问题，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 提出JEDA，一个领域初始化的双编码器，基于PubMedBERT初始化，用去重对比目标微调，训练时使用受限LLM指导。

Result: JEDA在实践中表现大幅优于其基础编码器和近期开放嵌入器。

Conclusion: JEDA是一个能将环境上下文与可操作临床订单实时关联的快速、可解释且无LLM的检索层。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ARM - FM框架，利用基础模型自动构建奖励机器用于强化学习奖励设计，并验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数规范高度敏感，限制其广泛应用。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器，将语言嵌入与奖励机器状态关联。

Result: 在多样挑战性环境中验证了ARM - FM的有效性，包括零样本泛化证据。

Conclusion: ARM - FM框架可实现强化学习中自动、组合式奖励设计。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前越狱研究多关注单轮提示，而实际骚扰多为多轮交互，需研究多轮攻击对大语言模型代理的影响。

Method: 提出包含合成多轮骚扰对话数据集、多智能体模拟、三种越狱方法和混合评估框架的在线骚扰代理基准，使用LLaMA - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct和Gemini - 2.0 - flash进行实验。

Result: 越狱调优使骚扰成功率大幅提升，拒绝率降低，常见毒性行为增多，不同模型有不同升级轨迹，闭源模型更脆弱。

Conclusion: 多轮且基于理论的攻击成功率高并模拟人类骚扰动态，需开发强大安全护栏保障在线平台安全负责。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

TL;DR: 提出LiveResearchBench基准和DeepEval评估套件，对17个前沿深度研究系统进行综合评估，分析系统优劣势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未满足严格评估深度研究能力的四项原则，无法进行公平比较，因此需要新的基准和评估方法。

Method: 依据四项原则构建包含100个专家策划任务的LiveResearchBench基准，引入覆盖内容和报告层面质量的DeepEval评估套件，对17个系统进行评估。

Result: 揭示了当前系统的优势、常见失败模式以及推进可靠、有洞察力的深度研究所需的关键系统组件。

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench和DeepEval为深度研究系统的系统评估提供了严谨基础，有助于推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

TL;DR: 研究自学习能否在不依赖人工数据集和预定义规则奖励的情况下扩展基于大语言模型的智能体，提出Agentic Self - Learning (ASL)框架并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自学习在不依赖人工数据集和预定义规则奖励时扩展大语言模型智能体的可能性。

Method: 在搜索智能体环境中进行控制实验，提出ASL这一全闭环、多角色强化学习框架，协调提示生成器、策略模型和生成式奖励模型。

Result: ASL实现逐轮稳定增益，超越强RLVR基线，在零标签数据条件下持续改进；发现生成式奖励模型（GRM）奖励优于规则信号，数据量增加提升智能体能力，GRM验证能力是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放域智能体学习的关键因素，多角色协同进化对可扩展、自改进智能体有效。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Motivation: 现有评估大模型推理能力的基准范围有限，缺乏根据模型推理能力变化调整难度的灵活性。

Conclusion: MorphoBench增强了模型推理评估的全面性和有效性，为提升大模型推理能力和科学稳健性提供可靠指导。

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

TL;DR: 大语言模型微调时安全对齐易受损，提出GuardSpace框架解决该问题，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在适应过程中安全对齐脆弱，微调易导致预训练安全行为退化，产生有害响应。

Method: 提出GuardSpace框架，包括安全敏感子空间和抗有害零空间；用协方差预条件奇异值分解分解预训练权重，初始化低秩适配器并冻结安全相关组件；构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新。

Result: 在多个下游任务上实验表明GuardSpace性能优于现有方法，如在GSM8K上微调Llama - 2 - 7B - Chat，有害得分从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace能在微调过程中有效保持大语言模型的安全对齐，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在自动化任务时有新风险，如不一致和恶意攻击，需要研究安全、隐私和安全性。

Method: 提出Terrarium框架，改造黑板设计创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量，实现三个协作多智能体场景并进行四种代表性攻击。

Result: 展示了框架的灵活性，提供了快速原型、评估和迭代防御与设计的工具。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架有助于加速迈向可信多智能体系统的进程。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型多智能体系统易受级联错误影响，单个错误步骤会传播并破坏轨迹。

Method: 通过Next-Execution Reconstruction和Prototype-Guided Enhancement两种互补设计进行历史条件异常评分，检测到异常时触发修正智能体。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC优于所有基线，将步骤级错误检测的AUC - ROC提高达8.47%；插入不同MAS框架有端到端增益。

Conclusion: MASC的元认知监控和针对性修正能以最小开销减轻错误传播。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Result: 案例研究如实时21点顾问、博物馆导游和购物试穿助手，展示其能无缝感知环境、推断用户意图并主动提供帮助。

Conclusion: Alpha - Service框架可实现主动实时的日常生活协助。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Result: TITAN能使模型生成语法有效、语义连贯且可在底层图上确定性执行的推理路径。

Conclusion: TITAN框架在网络威胁查询和推理方面有良好表现。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

TL;DR: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLM）数学推理能力落后，提出无调优的IP - Merging方法提升其数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数研究聚焦大语言模型（LLM）数学推理能力，MLLM数学推理表现落后，现有模型合并方法未考虑MLLM与LLM的对齐问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出IP - Merging方法，先识别MLLM和数学LLM中与推理相关的参数，投影到MLLM子空间以保持对齐，最后在该子空间合并参数。

Result: 大量实验表明，IP - Merging方法可直接从数学LLM提升MLLM的数学推理能力，且不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP - Merging是一种有效的无调优方法，能提升MLLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

Result: 在AitW基准测试中任务成功率达87.9%，显著优于先前方法；在ScreenSpot - v2基准测试中有竞争力的零样本泛化能力；在AndroidWorld基准测试中，使用更大骨干网络时可有效扩展。

Conclusion: Hi - Agent在复杂移动控制场景中具有强大的适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划的挑战，以及多智能体系统推理成本高、响应延迟长和端到端训练难的问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力集成到单个紧凑模型中，并进行简单的端到端训练。

Result: 以Qwen3 - 8B - Instruct为基础模型训练后，在TravelPlanner基准测试中最终通过率达82.7%，远超DeepSeek - R1 - 671B的40%，且模型规模小。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架有效，单个小规模模型能获得多智能体系统的能力并超越它。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

Conclusion: 给出派生谓词负出现消除的对应转换。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

Result: JSPLIT显著减少提示大小，不影响有效响应能力，工具增多时还能提高工具选择准确性。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Conclusion: 说明了预训练LLM适应开放性的潜力和当前局限，指出训练智能体管理内存、有效探索和追求抽象长期目标的未来方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽嵌入人类交流和决策，但因基于统计预测而非推理，存在幻觉风险，需解决其认知和认知偏差问题。

Method: 引入Rose - Frame三维框架，从Map vs. Territory、Intuition vs. Reason、Conflict vs. Confirmation三个维度诊断人机交互问题。

Result: Rose - Frame不通过增加数据或规则修复LLMs，而是作为反思工具，让模型局限和用户假设可见。

Conclusion: 应将对齐视为认知治理，以人类理性治理直觉，嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督来使机器流畅性与人类理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Conclusion: 能将理论上合理的功利主义算法配置提升到与常用启发式配置程序竞争的水平，还可探索解对效用函数变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

Result: PAVE方法提升了基于任务向量的合并方法的性能。

Conclusion: PAVE方法在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构中均有效。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Conclusion: CoAST框架能够解决现有大语言模型在POI推荐任务中的问题，提升推荐性能。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Conclusion: 揭示将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则“探索更多但保留更少”。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Motivation: 解决现有RLVR方法重利用轻探索，导致pass@K性能下降的问题。

Method: 分析RLVR训练动态，提出SimKO方法，对正确响应提升前K个候选概率，对错误响应惩罚top-1候选。

Result: SimKO在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，对不同K值都能持续提高pass@K。

Conclusion: SimKO能有效缓解过集中问题，是提升RLVR探索能力的简单方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

Motivation: 使用大语言模型在大量SQL数据库上执行NL2SQL方法时，处理大量元信息导致提示长、成本高，需解决该挑战。

Method: 引入Datalake Agent系统，采用交互式循环减少元信息使用，在推理框架中让大语言模型按需请求必要信息。

Result: 在23个数据库的100个表问答任务评估中，Datalake Agent最多减少大语言模型87%的token使用。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent能大幅降低成本，且保持有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: RoboGPT - R1框架能有效提升具身智能体在长视野操作任务中的推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

TL;DR: 介绍Instruction Boosting提高大语言模型提示指令可靠性，用SCALEDIF基准测试展示结果，分析指令增加性能下降原因并提供冲突评分工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单纯添加指令无法保证大语言模型遵循的问题，提高提示指令可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，创建SCALEDIF基准测试，分析指令数量与性能关系，开发定量冲突评分工具。

Result: Instruction Boosting使两条指令遵循率最多提高7个百分点，十条最多提高4个百分点，发现指令数量增加导致性能下降与指令间冲突有关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting可提高大语言模型提示指令遵循率，定量冲突评分工具能解释性能趋势并为开发者提供反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

Result: 提出了一种可行的语言和操作工具来衡量智能体及其搜索空间。

Conclusion: 为大语言模型构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文针对大语言模型作为自主代理时的局限性，提出了Gatekeeper协议，并以Sage为例验证其能提升代理可靠性、计算效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为自主代理存在上下文窗口有限和状态不同步问题，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测和资源使用低效。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper协议，让代理先对系统的低保真“潜在状态”表示进行操作和推理，按需请求高保真上下文，所有交互通过统一JSON格式进行。

Result: 以Sage为例进行验证，该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过减少令牌消耗提高了计算效率，实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: 该协议为任何结构化知识领域构建更强大、可预测和可靠的AI代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

Motivation: 企业智能平台需集成第三方日志，但测试时厂商文档存在问题，导致模式映射困难。

Method: 引入可自我提升的强化学习代理，推理时识别模糊映射、生成网络搜索查询收集证据、应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 以微软日志转换为例，使用GPT - 4o在100次迭代中，映射准确率从56.4%（仅大语言模型）提升到72.73%（RAG）再到93.94%，需专家审查的低置信度映射数量减少85%。

Conclusion: 该新方法为解决未来行业问题提供了循证、透明的途径，为更优解决方案奠定基础。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Result: 在固定计算预算下，混合方法在AIME2025上准确率比生成验证高15.3%。

Conclusion: 对于实际应用，基于判别验证的预算感知扩展是对自一致性的免费升级，也是昂贵生成技术的更有效替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Conclusion: 为多模态抑郁检测的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: 重新解读康德的《纯粹理性批判》，并探索其与推理系统过度自信问题的联系。

Method: 将康德理论解读为反馈稳定性理论，用复合不稳定指数H - Risk形式化，进行线性 - 高斯模拟，研究大语言模型。

Result: 线性 - 高斯模拟中高H - Risk预测过度自信错误，大语言模型中脆弱内部动态与校准错误和幻觉相关，批判式提示效果不一。

Conclusion: 康德的自我限制与反馈控制间存在结构桥梁，可为诊断和选择性减少推理系统过度自信提供原则性视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有构建有效PRMs方法存在缺乏可扩展高质量标注的问题，导致奖励噪声、低事实保真度和与步骤推理目标不一致。

Method: 构建GroundedPRM框架，用蒙特卡罗树搜索构建推理路径、用外部工具验证步骤、设计混合奖励聚合机制、格式化奖励信号。

Result: 仅用4万自动标注样本（为最佳自动标注监督PRM数据量10%），在ProcessBench上平均性能相对提升达26%，奖励引导搜索时超人工标注监督的PRMs。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM为高质量过程级推理提供可扩展且可验证的途径。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Conclusion: 研究显示自动地质分类系统存在挑战，为材料表征和分选技术提供了方法框架。

Abstract: Automated rock classification from mineral composition presents a significant
challenge in geological applications, with critical implications for material
recycling, resource management, and industrial processing. While existing
methods using One dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) excel at
mineral identification through Raman spectroscopy, the crucial step of
determining rock types from mineral assemblages remains unsolved, particularly
because the same minerals can form different rock types depending on their
proportions and formation conditions. This study presents a novel
knowledge-enhanced deep learning approach that integrates geological domain
expertise with spectral analysis. The performance of five machine learning
methods were evaluated out of which the 1D-CNN and its uncertainty-aware
variant demonstrated excellent mineral classification performance
(98.37+-0.006% and 97.75+-0.010% respectively). The integrated system's
evaluation on rock samples revealed variable performance across lithologies,
with optimal results for limestone classification but reduced accuracy for
rocks sharing similar mineral assemblages. These findings not only show
critical challenges in automated geological classification systems but also
provide a methodological framework for advancing material characterization and
sorting technologies.

Result: 基准测试结果表明，Neural ODE在效率和精度上均优于POD - DEIM。

Conclusion: Neural ODE在实时超导仿真方面有很大潜力。

Abstract: Efficient modeling of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) is crucial for
real-time quench monitoring; however, full-order electromagnetic simulations
remain prohibitively costly due to the strong nonlinearities. Conventional
reduced-order methods, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and
Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), alleviate this cost but are
limited by intrusive implementation and by the need for many interpolation
points. This work investigates reduced-order strategies for Integral Equation
Method (IEM) of HTS systems. We present the first application of POD-DEIM to
IEM-based HTS models, and introduce a Structured Neural Ordinary Differential
Equation (Neural ODE) approach that learns nonlinear dynamics directly in the
reduced space. Benchmark results show that the Neural ODE outperforms POD-DEIM
in both efficiency and accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-time
superconducting simulations.

Motivation: 生成式AI带来新的HPC工作负载，当前HPC集群设计无法有效支持，存在长等待时间和高启动成本问题。

Conclusion: “Pervasive Context Management”技术能有效解决新HPC工作负载问题，提高应用执行效率。

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI introduces a new class of HPC workloads that
integrates lightweight LLMs with traditional high-throughput applications to
accelerate scientific discovery. The current design of HPC clusters is
inadequate to support this new class however, either incurring long wait times
on static batch queues or repeatedly paying expensive LLM startup costs upon
resource preemption. To circumvent both the long queues and high startup costs,
we propose to "decouple" the LLM initialization context from the actual LLM
inferences, and retain the context in GPUs until it is no longer needed, a
technique we term "Pervasive Context Management". We transform a fact
verification application to enable this technique, allowing it to reduce its
execution time by 72.1% (from 3 hours to 48 minutes) using the same amount of
GPUs, and scale opportunistically on 32.8% of all GPUs in the cluster and
further reduce the execution time to 13 minutes.

Result: 基于商品库的实现与参考串行GraphBLAS基线相比，在8x NVIDIA A100 GPU上实现高达55倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 采用通用高效编程模型不会影响关键路径性能，C++26 Senders模型在网络分析任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: Large-scale network sensing plays a vital role in network traffic analysis
and characterization. As network packet data grows increasingly large, parallel
methods have become mainstream for network analytics. While effective,
GPU-based implementations still face start-up challenges in host-device memory
management and porting complex workloads on devices, among others. To mitigate
these challenges, composable frameworks have emerged using modern C++
programming language, for efficiently deploying analytics tasks on GPUs.
Specifically, the recent C++26 Senders model of asynchronous data operation
chaining provides a simple interface for bulk pushing tasks to varied device
execution contexts.
  Considering the prominence of contemporary dense-GPU platforms and
vendor-leveraged software libraries, such a programming model consider GPUs as
first-class execution resources (compared to traditional host-centric
programming models), allowing convenient development of multi-GPU application
workloads via expressive and standardized asynchronous semantics. In this
paper, we discuss practical aspects of developing the Anonymized Network
Sensing Graph Challenge on dense-GPU systems using the recently proposed C++26
Senders model. Adopting a generic and productive programming model does not
necessarily impact the critical-path performance (as compared to low-level
proprietary vendor-based programming models): our commodity library-based
implementation achieves up to 55x performance improvements on 8x NVIDIA A100
GPUs as compared to the reference serial GraphBLAS baseline.

Result: 减少了计算和内存中的阶段间干扰，实现更好的KV缓存利用、更高吞吐量和更可预测的性能。

Conclusion: Cortex为更高级的、原生代理服务范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Cortex, a prototype workflow-aware serving platform designed for
agentic workloads. The core principle of Cortex is stage isolation: it
provisions dedicated resource pools for each distinct stage of an agentic
workflow. This simple yet powerful strategy mitigates inter-stage interference
in compute and memory, leading to better KV cache utilization, higher
throughput, and more predictable performance. By customizing resource
allocation and scheduling within each distinct stage of agentic workflows,
Cortex lays the groundwork for more advanced, agent-native serving paradigms,
including malleable resource management, speculative execution of workflow
branches, and a shared, multi-tiered cache for "agentic state."

Abstract: Computing fixed-radius near-neighbor graphs is an important first step for
many data analysis algorithms. Near-neighbor graphs connect points that are
close under some metric, endowing point clouds with a combinatorial structure.
As computing power and data acquisition methods advance, diverse sources of
large scientific datasets would greatly benefit from scalable solutions to this
common subroutine for downstream analysis. Prior work on parallel nearest
neighbors has made great progress in problems like k-nearest and approximate
nearest neighbor search problems, with particular attention on Euclidean
spaces. Yet many applications need exact solutions and non-Euclidean metrics.
This paper presents a scalable sparsity-aware distributed memory algorithm
using cover trees to compute near-neighbor graphs in general metric spaces. We
provide a shared-memory algorithm for cover tree construction and demonstrate
its competitiveness with state-of-the-art fixed-radius search data structures.
We then introduce two distributed-memory algorithms for the near-neighbor graph
problem, a simple point-partitioning strategy and a spatial-partitioning
strategy, which leverage the cover tree algorithm on each node. Our algorithms
exhibit parallel scaling across a variety of real and synthetic datasets for
both traditional and non-traditional metrics. On real world high dimensional
datasets with one million points, we achieve speedups up to 678.34x over the
state-of-the-art using 1024 cores for graphs with 70 neighbors per vertex (on
average), and up to 1590.99x using 4096 cores for graphs with 500 neighbors per
vertex (on average).

Abstract: Interoperability is essential for transforming blockchains from isolated
networks into collaborative ecosystems, unlocking their full potential. While
significant progress has been made in public blockchain interoperability,
bridging permissioned and permissionless blockchains poses unique challenges
due to differences in access control, architectures, and security requirements.
This paper introduces a blockchain-agnostic framework to enable
interoperability between permissioned and permissionless networks. Leveraging
cryptographic techniques, the framework ensures secure data exchanges. Its
lightweight architectural design simplifies implementation and maintenance,
while the integration of Clover and Dandelion++ protocols enhances transaction
anonymity. Performance evaluations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
achieving secure and efficient interoperability by measuring the forwarding
time, the throughput, the availability, and their collusion impact of the
system across heterogeneous blockchain ecosystems.

Motivation: 现有拜占庭容错共识协议存在价值提取攻击风险，先进协议验证计算冗余。

Method: 采用非对称架构，领导者维护UTIG并生成公平性证明，追随者无状态验证；引入三项创新。

Result: 实验表明在部分同步环境下，相比对称图基基线，AUTIG有更高吞吐量和更低端到端延迟，且保持γ - 批量顺序公平性。

Conclusion: AUTIG打破对称冗余范式，能有效提升区块链系统性能。

Abstract: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols ensure agreement on
transaction ordering despite malicious actors, but unconstrained ordering power
enables sophisticated value extraction attacks like front running and sandwich
attacks - a critical threat to blockchain systems. Order-fair consensus curbs
adversarial value extraction by constraining how leaders may order
transactions. While state-of-the-art protocols such as Themis attain strong
guarantees through graph-based ordering, they ask every replica to re-run the
leader's expensive ordering computation for validation - an inherently
symmetric and redundant paradigm. We present AUTIG, a high-performance,
pluggable order-fairness service that breaks this symmetry. Our key insight is
that verifying a fair order does not require re-computing it. Instead,
verification can be reduced to a stateless audit of succinct, verifiable
assertions about the ordering graph's properties. AUTIG realizes this via an
asymmetric architecture: the leader maintains a persistent
Unconfirmed-Transaction Incremental Graph (UTIG) to amortize graph construction
across rounds and emits a structured proof of fairness with each proposal;
followers validate the proof without maintaining historical state. AUTIG
introduces three critical innovations: (i) incremental graph maintenance driven
by threshold-crossing events and state changes; (ii) a decoupled pipeline that
overlaps leader-side collection/update/extraction with follower-side stateless
verification; and (iii) a proof design covering all internal pairs in the
finalized prefix plus a frontier completeness check to rule out hidden external
dependencies. We implement AUTIG and evaluate it against symmetric graph-based
baselines under partial synchrony. Experiments show higher throughput and lower
end-to-end latency while preserving gamma-batch-order-fairness.

Motivation: 现有无停顿批处理调度器存在计算不公平问题，导致系统整体服务质量下降。

Method: 提出FairBatching调度器，有自适应批容量确定机制、公平动态批形成算法和新的负载估计方法。

Result: 显著降低TTFT尾延迟达2.29倍，单节点容量提升20.0%，集群级容量提升54.3%。

Conclusion: FairBatching调度器能在维持TPOT服务水平目标的同时，实现资源公平分配，提升系统容量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental tension
between minimizing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency for new requests and
maintaining a high, steady token generation rate (low Time-Per-Output-Token, or
TPOT) for ongoing requests. Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by
Sarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant
computational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively,
simultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill
queuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of
service (QoS).
  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic
nature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid
decode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We
therefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces
fair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an
adaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the
computational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO
violations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the
decode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed
from bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness.
Furthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling
more effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and
evaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail
latency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall
20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in
cluster-level capacity.

Motivation: 研究带删除的无限球入箱过程中最大负载相对当前平均负载和最高平均负载的差异和过载情况，进行理论分析和界定。

Method: 使用分层归纳，结合详细的势分析，运用概率耦合简化分析。

Result: 证明任意时刻总超出平均负载的球数为O(n)，差异为O(log(n))并给出匹配下界，过载为loglog(n)+O(1)，对于“好”的插入概率序列差异也有界。

Conclusion: 对带删除的无限球入箱过程的负载差异和过载情况给出了理论上的界，分析方法有效且可简化分析过程。

Abstract: We consider an infinite balls-into-bins process with deletions where in each
discrete step $t$ a coin is tossed as to whether, with probability $\beta(t)
\in (0,1)$, a new ball is allocated using the Greedy[2] strategy (which places
the ball in the lower loaded of two bins sampled uniformly at random) or, with
remaining probability $1-\beta(t)$, a ball is deleted from a non-empty bin
chosen uniformly at random. Let $n$ be the number of bins and $m(t)$ the total
load at time $t$. We are interested in bounding the discrepancy $x_{\max}(t) -
m(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to current average) and the overload
$x_{\max}(t) - m_{\max}(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to highest average
observed so far).
  We prove that at an arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the total number of balls
above the average is $O(n)$ and that the discrepancy is $ O(\log(n))$. For the
discrepancy, we provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore we prove that at an
arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the overload is $\log\log(n)+O(1)$. For "good"
insertion probability sequences (in which the average load of time intervals
with polynomial length increases in expectation) we show that even the
discrepancy is bounded by $\log\log(n)+O(1)$.
  One of our main analytical tools is a layered induction, as per [ABKU99].
Since our model allows for rather more general scenarios than what was
previously considered, the formal analysis requires some extra ingredients as
well, in particular a detailed potential analysis. Furthermore, we simplify the
setup by applying probabilistic couplings to obtain certain "recovery"
properties, which eliminate much of the need for intricate and careful
conditioning elsewhere in the analysis.

Motivation: 传统长距离网络连接加速器存在局限，需要新架构解决互连和内存共享问题。

Method: 将XLink和CXL集成到统一XLink - CXL混合架构，用XLink进行集群内通信，用基于CXL的交换结构进行集群间内存共享，引入显式内存分层。

Result: ScalePool加速LLM训练平均1.22倍，最高1.84倍；提出的二级内存分离策略使内存密集型工作负载延迟最多降低4.5倍。

Conclusion: ScalePool架构在加速LLM训练和降低内存密集型工作负载延迟方面表现出色，具有可行性和优势。

Abstract: This paper proposes ScalePool, a novel cluster architecture designed to
interconnect numerous accelerators using unified hardware interconnects rather
than traditional long-distance networking. ScalePool integrates
Accelerator-Centric Links (XLink) and Compute Express Link (CXL) into a unified
XLink-CXL hybrid fabric. Specifically, ScalePool employs XLink for
intra-cluster, low-latency accelerator communication, while using hierarchical
CXL-based switching fabrics for scalable and coherent inter-cluster memory
sharing. By abstracting interfaces through CXL, ScalePool structurally resolves
interoperability constraints, enabling heterogeneous cluster operation and
composable resource disaggregation. In addition, ScalePool introduces explicit
memory tiering: the latency-critical tier-1 combines accelerator-local memory
with coherence-centric CXL and XLink, whereas the highcapacity tier-2 employs
dedicated memory nodes interconnected by a CXL-based fabric, achieving scalable
and efficient memory pooling. Evaluation results show that ScalePool
accelerates LLM training by 1.22x on average and up to 1.84x compared to
conventional RDMA-based environments. Furthermore, the proposed tier-2 memory
disaggregation strategy reduces latency by up to 4.5x for memory-intensive
workloads.

Conclusion: JASDA能将理论调度模型与现代MIG - 启用环境的实际部署相连接，适用于人工智能和农业4.0领域。

Abstract: The increasing complexity and temporal variability of workloads on
MIG-enabled GPUs challenge the scalability of traditional centralized
scheduling. Building upon the SJA concept, this paper introduces JASDA-a novel
paradigm that extends SJA from a largely centralized scheduling model toward a
fully decentralized negotiation process. In JASDA, jobs actively generate and
score feasible subjobs in response to scheduler-announced execution windows,
while the scheduler performs policy-driven clearing that balances utilization,
fairness, and temporal responsiveness. This bidirectional, iterative
interaction embeds feedback, calibration, and probabilistic safety directly
into the scheduling loop, enabling adaptive and transparent decision-making. By
coupling principles from auction theory and online optimization with the
temporal granularity of GPU workloads, JASDA provides a scalable foundation for
market-aware and fairness-driven resource management-bridging theoretical
scheduling models with practical deployment in modern MIG-enabled environments
relevant to Artificial Intelligence and Agriculture 4.0.

Motivation: 传统MPI实现依赖显式内存复制操作，在涉及大量处理器间通信的HPC工作负载中产生冗余数据移动和缓冲区管理开销，影响性能。

Conclusion: MPI-over-CXL有潜力提高大规模HPC环境的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: MPI implementations commonly rely on explicit memory-copy operations,
incurring overhead from redundant data movement and buffer management. This
overhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor
communication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI
communication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared
memory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy
methods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication
latency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly
into the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient
pointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To
validate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software
environment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host
emulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative
benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional
MPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and
scalability in large-scale HPC environments.

Abstract: We introduce xLLM, an intelligent and efficient Large Language Model (LLM)

challenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the
service layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that
efficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline
tasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This
module also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD)
disaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation
policy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a
distributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust
fault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer,
xLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate
computing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer
execution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory
management. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such
as optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to
substantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource
efficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to
1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while
maintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series

Motivation: 现有全连接网络依赖虚拟通道避免死锁，但虚拟通道带来高开销，限制交换机可扩展性，且无虚拟通道的链路排序方案在对抗性流量下性能下降。

Method: 提出TERA算法，利用嵌入式物理子网提供无死锁的非最短路径，无需虚拟通道。

Result: 在全连接网络中，TERA处理对抗性流量时比链路排序路由算法性能高80%，在应用内核中高100%；与基于虚拟通道的方法相比，减少50%的缓冲区需求；在2D - HyperX评估中，优于使用相同数量虚拟通道的现有算法，性能提升达32%。

Conclusion: TERA算法在全连接网络中表现良好，能有效解决现有路由方案的问题。

Abstract: High-radix, low-diameter networks like HyperX and Dragonfly use a Full-mesh
core, and rely on multiple virtual channels (VCs) to avoid packet deadlocks in
adaptive routing. However, VCs introduce significant overhead in the switch in
terms of area, power, and design complexity, limiting the switch scalability.
This paper starts by revisiting VC-less routing through link ordering schemes
in Full-mesh networks, which offer implementation simplicity but suffer from
performance degradation under adversarial traffic. Thus, to overcome these
challenges, we propose TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm), a novel
routing algorithm which employs an embedded physical subnetwork to provide
deadlock-free non-minimal paths without using VCs.
  In a Full-mesh network, TERA outperforms link ordering routing algorithms by
80% when dealing with adversarial traffic, and up to 100% in application
kernels. Furthermore, compared to other VC-based approaches, it reduces buffer
requirements by 50%, while maintaining comparable latency and throughput.
Lastly, early results from a 2D-HyperX evaluation show that TERA outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms that use the same number of VCs, achieving
performance improvements of up to 32%.

Abstract: Algorithms with predictions} has emerged as a powerful framework to combine
the robustness of traditional online algorithms with the data-driven
performance benefits of machine-learned (ML) predictions. However, most
existing approaches in this paradigm are overly conservative, {as they do not
leverage problem structure to optimize performance in a prediction-specific
manner}. In this paper, we show that such prediction-specific performance
criteria can enable significant performance improvements over the coarser
notions of consistency and robustness considered in prior work. Specifically,
we propose a notion of \emph{strongly-optimal} algorithms with predictions,
which obtain Pareto optimality not just in the worst-case tradeoff between
robustness and consistency, but also in the prediction-specific tradeoff
between these metrics. We develop a general bi-level optimization framework
that enables systematically designing strongly-optimal algorithms in a wide
variety of problem settings, and we propose explicit strongly-optimal
algorithms for several classic online problems: deterministic and randomized
ski rental, and one-max search. Our analysis reveals new structural insights
into how predictions can be optimally integrated into online algorithms by
leveraging a prediction-specific design. To validate the benefits of our
proposed framework, we empirically evaluate our algorithms in case studies on
problems including dynamic power management and volatility-based index trading.
Our results demonstrate that prediction-specific, strongly-optimal algorithms
can significantly improve performance across a variety of online
decision-making settings.

Motivation: 现有常量跳捷径含稠密子图，有显著缺点，需研究树状的常量跳树捷径。

Method: 对衡量图与树差异的两个参数（树状性和树宽）进行研究。

Result: 得到树状捷径新上下界，包括直到O(log log n)的跳直径和树宽的最优权衡，以及更大k值的下界。

Conclusion: 解决了[FL22, Le23]的开放问题，得出所有跳直径下hop - diameter × treewidth = Ω((log log n)^2)。

Abstract: Sparse shortcuttings of trees -- equivalently, sparse 1-spanners for tree
metrics with bounded hop-diameter -- have been studied extensively (under
different names and settings), since the pioneering works of [Yao82, Cha87,
AS87, BTS94], initially motivated by applications to range queries, online tree
product, and MST verification, to name a few. These constructions were also
lifted from trees to other graph families using known low-distortion embedding
results. The works of [Yao82, Cha87, AS87, BTS94] establish a tight tradeoff
between hop-diameter and sparsity (or average degree) for tree shortcuttings
and imply constant-hop shortcuttings for $n$-node trees with sparsity $O(\log^*
n)$. Despite their small sparsity, all known constant-hop shortcuttings contain
dense subgraphs (of sparsity $\Omega(\log n)$), which is a significant drawback
for many applications.
  We initiate a systematic study of constant-hop tree shortcuttings that are
``tree-like''. We focus on two well-studied graph parameters that measure how
far a graph is from a tree: arboricity and treewidth. Our contribution is
twofold.
  * New upper and lower bounds for tree-like shortcuttings of trees, including
an optimal tradeoff between hop-diameter and treewidth for all hop-diameter up
to $O(\log\log n)$. We also provide a lower bound for larger values of $k$,
which together yield $\text{hop-diameter}\times \text{treewidth} =
\Omega((\log\log n)^2)$ for all values of hop-diameter, resolving an open
question of [FL22, Le23]. [...]

### [73] [Why Instant-Runoff Voting Is So Resilient to Coalitional Manipulation: Phase Transitions in the Perturbed Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14450)
*François Durand*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 分析三种投票规则对联盟操纵的敏感性，揭示临界值现象，指出超级孔多塞胜者是IRV抗操纵的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究虽表明即时决选投票（IRV）对联盟操纵有高抗性，但理论原因不明，为填补此空白开展研究。

Method: 在扰动文化模型中分析多数决、两轮制和IRV三种投票规则对联盟操纵的敏感性。

Result: 每种规则在偏好集中度临界值theta_c处发生相变，大选民群体的联盟操纵概率在theta_c之下指数收敛到1，之上收敛到0；引入超级孔多塞胜者（SCW），理论和实证表明其是IRV抗操纵的关键因素；证明IRV的theta_c = 0。

Conclusion: IRV即使在极小偏好集中度下也对联盟操纵有抗性，超级孔多塞胜者是其抗操纵的重要原因。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

TL;DR: 提出利益相关者共投方案，用随机联盟博弈公式分析大联盟稳定性，以MEC部署为例，数值结果展示不同情况下稳定性和盈利性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新服务如MEC部署需大量投资，单一利益相关者难以承担，需多方共投。

Method: 提出随机联盟博弈公式，基于鲁棒博弈理论，考虑稳定性和盈利性。

Result: SP收入规模相近且投资期长时，稳定性概率下限高；收入变化大时，稳定性下限低但仍有盈利。

Conclusion: 该共投框架在MEC等新服务部署中有应用价值，可平衡稳定性和盈利性。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

Motivation: 区块链网络中MEV提取机制转变带来复杂战略挑战，传统博弈论方法在高频、部分可观测环境中难以适用。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，包括模拟环境建模、基于PPO的投标代理优化。

Result: 历史条件代理在与现有搜索者一起部署时捕获49%的可用利润，取代市场领导者时捕获81%，显著优于静态投标策略。

Conclusion: 强化学习在传统优化方法失效的高频MEV环境中具有关键优势，对行业参与者和协议设计者有直接价值。

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

Motivation: 传统分配立法机构席位问题是一次性过程，未考虑动态因素，而动态方面在很多场景中很重要，因此研究在线环境下的分配问题。

Method: 引入无未来信息的比例分配框架，研究确定性和随机在线分配方法，构造对抗实例求最坏情况偏差下界，通过递归构造网络进行随机分配。

Conclusion: 提出在线环境下分配问题的研究框架和方法，给出确定性和随机分配的相关结论，成果可用于在线依赖舍入程序获取近似解。

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

Motivation: 将博弈学习研究拓展到具有非渐近稳定性的动态情况，探究其与集体理性经济性质的联系。

Method: 引入一致稳定性的概念，在温和非退化条件和战略等价下进行分析。

Result: 非一致稳定的混合均衡不是弱帕累托最优；局部一致稳定的均衡是弱帕累托最优；一致稳定性决定了增量平滑最佳响应动态的最后迭代收敛行为。

Conclusion: 与严格均衡附近动态不同，个体在混合纳什均衡附近追求效用的行为能实现集体理性。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.

Motivation: 实现金融数据库的自然语言查询，解决现有方法在可靠性、延迟和成本效率方面的问题。

Method: 将大语言模型与OpenAI Function Calling API结合，将用户请求路由到经过审查的参数化查询库。

Result: LLM单独预测有不可忽视的误差和前瞻偏差；股票代码映射准确率高；FinAI Data Assistant在延迟、成本和可靠性上优于文本到SQL基线。

Conclusion: FinAI Data Assistant是一种实用的金融数据库自然语言查询方法，同时讨论了设计权衡、局限性和部署途径。

Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language
querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs)
with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via
text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted,
parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low
latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1)
whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial
data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock
ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for
end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices
and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show
look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs.
Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high
for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and
cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We
discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.

Abstract: In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval
stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to
a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from
outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests),
where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions
candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of
several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach
that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual
encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and
content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline,
including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at
LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online
serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the
prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding,
facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The
system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed
substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains
among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that
high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how
generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high
throughput retrieval in industrial applications.

Motivation: 当前采用静态基于模式的提示机制的方法存在忽视用户偏好多样性、语义知识表示与行为特征空间浅层对齐的问题，需改进。

Method: 引入CoCo框架，通过双机制动态构建用户特定的上下文知识嵌入，利用自适应知识融合和矛盾解决模块实现语义和行为潜在维度的深度整合。

Conclusion: CoCo框架具有模块化设计和模型无关架构，可为需要知识增强推理和个性化适配的下一代推荐系统提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems
has revealed promising potential through their capacity to extract world
knowledge for enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, current methodologies
that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant
limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the
multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement
superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral
feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that
dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a
dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic
and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and
contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse
benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate
CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven
cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on
a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating
its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic
architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation
recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and
personalized adaptation.

Conclusion: LREM能有效弥合原始查询和目标商品间的语义差距，显著提高检索准确性，已部署到中国最大电商平台。

Abstract: In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an
indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item
(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from
large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models
(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs
for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt
direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains
inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve
tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend
to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing
them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries
exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance
degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding
Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation
learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a
deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a
reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process
effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,
significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage
training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated
Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary
reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the
reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and
online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its
deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.

Abstract: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta

egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as
judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in
negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the
internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic
regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and
the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these
models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it
significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top

Conclusion: GemiRec框架能有效解决多兴趣推荐的局限性，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial
retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple
user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user
interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations:
the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The
second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to
capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin
with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then,
we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we
propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named
GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a
structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving
dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest
Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest
dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a
generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c)
Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple
user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well
as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness.
Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its
practical value in industrial applications.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces
key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning,
especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by
limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to
capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation
contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework
that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve
personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to
enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy
between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional
query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval.
Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to
autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and
reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive
reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly
personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized
recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.

Conclusion: CE - CDR作为与模型无关的插件有实用价值，已在2025年4月投入生产。

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation
systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or
features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating
inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain
modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features
without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their
contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a
cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to
target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying
unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In
this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a
causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate
the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We
then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive
a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the
biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an
enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model
to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses,
as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness
of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover,
it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical
value in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究数据修剪对推荐系统数据集特性和算法性能的影响，发现常用修剪会使部分数据集用户大幅减少，修剪数据训练测试算法得分高，但在未修剪数据上测试优势消失，性能随修剪程度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究数据修剪（去除交互次数少于指定数量的用户）对推荐系统数据集特性和算法性能的影响。

Method: 分析五个基准数据集的未修剪形式和五个连续修剪级别，检查结构和分布特征，训练和测试十一种代表性算法，还评估在修剪训练集上训练但在未修剪数据上测试的模型。

Result: 常用核心修剪具有高选择性，部分数据集只剩2%原始用户；在修剪数据上训练测试时传统算法nDCG@10得分高，但在未修剪测试集上优势大多消失；所有算法在未修剪数据上测试时性能随修剪程度增加而下降。

Conclusion: 数据集缩减会对推荐算法性能产生影响。

Abstract: Offline evaluations in recommender system research depend heavily on
datasets, many of which are pruned, such as the widely used MovieLens
collections. This thesis examines the impact of data pruning - specifically,
removing users with fewer than a specified number of interactions - on both
dataset characteristics and algorithm performance. Five benchmark datasets were
analysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5,
10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional
characteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms. To
further assess if pruned datasets lead to artificially inflated performance
results, we also evaluated models trained on the pruned train sets but tested
on unpruned data. Results show that commonly applied core pruning can be highly
selective, leaving as little as 2% of the original users in some datasets.
Traditional algorithms achieved higher nDCG@10 scores when both training and
testing on pruned data; however, this advantage largely disappeared when
evaluated on unpruned test sets. Across all algorithms, performance declined
with increasing pruning levels when tested on unpruned data, highlighting the
impact of dataset reduction on the performance of recommender algorithms.

TL;DR: 传统推荐系统难以捕捉用户跨场景兴趣，本文提出LLM增强的RED - Rec推荐引擎，经在线A/B测试验证效果好，还引入数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统优先优化特定场景业务指标，忽略跨场景行为信号，难以集成LLM，限制捕捉用户整体兴趣的能力。

Method: 提出RED - Rec推荐引擎，统一多行为上下文的用户兴趣表示，采用双塔LLM框架和场景感知策略。

Result: 在RedNote上对数亿用户进行在线A/B测试，在内容推荐和广告定向任务上有显著性能提升，引入数据集RED - MMU。

Conclusion: 推进统一用户建模，实现更深入个性化，促进大规模UGC平台用户更有意义的参与。

Abstract: User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting
through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as
search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation
systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated
specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling
to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which
finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform
touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender
Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content
recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across
multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from
varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its
core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted
representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing
and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture
cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific
intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on
hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing
substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement
targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation
dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work
advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering
more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.

Motivation: 研究推荐系统反馈循环对个体行为和集体市场动态的影响。

Method: 引入模拟框架，使用亚马逊电商数据集分析不同推荐算法的影响。

Result: 反馈循环增加个体多样性，降低集体多样性，使需求集中在少数热门商品，部分推荐系统会增加用户同质化。

Conclusion: 推荐系统设计需平衡个性化与长期多样性。

Abstract: Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops
that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper
introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail
environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving
user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how
different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase
concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic
trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it
simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few
popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop
increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles
increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender
designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.

conducted multiple ablation studies, of which we report the results. In terms
of downstream performance, mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a particularly capable
small model, outperforming ColBERTv2 on common short-text benchmarks (BEIR) and
representing a large step forward in long-context tasks, with unprecedented
efficiency.

Method: 引入语义推理管道，用互信息和基于熵的稳定性分数引导的大语言模型集成生成高保真供应商标签，用课程学习对量化的LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优。

Result: 模型在2015个供应商上实现98.25%的top - 1准确率和90.73%的宏观准确率，能抵御缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操纵。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大语言模型为现实世界大规模设备识别提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Motivation: 假设神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，低频分量存储特定领域偏差，以此改进模型泛化性。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，分离出可泛化表示并保持架构完整性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等不同领域实验中，无论模型架构和数据模态，均有一致性能提升，方法能诱导特征稀疏化并有效分离高频分量。

Conclusion: 实验验证了核心假设，代码公开。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

Conclusion: CoLoR - GAN框架在GAN的小样本持续学习中高效，能在减少资源消耗的同时达到SOTA性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

Conclusion: SHaRe - SSM在长序列目标建模中表现优异且节能，适合资源受限应用。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

Motivation: 现有混合方法如JEM存在基于SGLD训练的不稳定性和样本质量差的问题，需同时实现稳健分类和高保真生成建模。

Method: 提出新训练框架，用基于AT的方法替代基于SGLD的JEM学习，进行协同对抗训练，采用两阶段训练程序。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高对抗鲁棒性，保持有竞争力的生成性能，在ImageNet上生成保真度超BigGAN并接近扩散模型。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题，表明对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Result: 证明三个性能指标权衡，改进现有结果，表明在一类策略下遗憾和平均队列长度权衡达最优。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有动态和概率组件，可优化低遗憾和小队列长度间权衡。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Method: 引入PeakClips数据集，K - frames采用三阶段渐进课程学习clip2frame选择，包括两个监督微调阶段和一个强化学习阶段。

Result: 在主要长视频理解基准上的广泛实验表明K - frames在各尺度关键帧选择上有效。

Conclusion: K - frames为关键帧选择提供了有效、可解释且可插拔的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Motivation: 现有方法针对单视图带标签数据的LDL问题，未考虑多视图含标签和无标签数据的LDL问题。

Method: 先计算各视图的k近邻集，用其他视图的近邻信息补充当前视图近邻集，基于补充后的近邻集构建图学习多视图半监督LDL模型。

Result: MVSS - LDL的分类性能明显优于现有的单视图LDL方法。

Conclusion: MVSS - LDL方法有效，是多视图LDL的首次尝试。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

TL;DR: 提出名为Weight Weaving的即插即用技术，可在无数据条件下改进模型合并方法，在多种实验设置中验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法设置缩放因子常依赖评估集数据，实际不可行，需无数据方法。

Method: 引入Weight Weaving技术，利用用户定义池化函数在缩放因子搜索空间中汇集模型权重，与现有方法正交且无需评估数据。

Result: 在三种实验设置中验证，持续改进多种模型合并方法性能，无数据条件下平均准确率最多提升15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving技术有效，能在无数据条件下改进模型合并方法性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将ICD代码分配和排序任务视为分类任务，忽略代码顺序，自动化该任务具有挑战性。

Method: 从检索系统角度将任务视为分类和排序任务。

Result: 提出的框架在识别高优先级代码上能力更强，正确排序主要诊断代码准确率达47%，分类指标上微F1和宏F1得分分别为0.6065和0.2904，均超之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 所提框架在处理ICD代码分配和排序任务上优于其他方法。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据保真损失函数易导致对噪声过拟合，需更好方法从噪声测量中恢复真实信号。

Method: 采用聚合视角，引入DC损失，用基于模型的概率分数进行分布级校准替代逐点匹配。

Result: 在图像去噪中无需提前停止且PSNR更高；在医学图像重建中减少伪影、增强手工正则化效果。

Conclusion: DC损失是逆问题中传统保真损失的统计上合理、性能更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Conclusion: BitDistill是一种有效的轻量级微调方法，能在降低计算成本的同时保持性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究表明专家剪枝对生成任务是比专家合并更优策略，提出REAP剪枝标准，在多种SMoE模型上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE模型参数多产生显著内存开销，需进行专家压缩。

Method: 提出考虑路由器门值和专家激活范数的Router - weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)剪枝标准。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的多种SMoE模型的生成基准测试中，REAP始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，在50%压缩率时表现突出，在代码生成和工具调用任务上实现近无损压缩。

Conclusion: 对于生成任务，专家剪枝是比专家合并更优的专家压缩策略。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Method: 提出条件Clifford - 可转向内核，用输入特征场计算的等变表示增强内核，通过隐式参数化有效求解等变约束。

Result: 在多个PDE预测任务（如流体动力学和相对论电动力学）上，所提方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提条件Clifford - 可转向内核框架提高了模型表达能力。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应逐层学习率方案能有效加速DNN训练，具有更快收敛速度。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Motivation: Transformer有二次复杂度和处理长距离依赖的问题，现有SSM如S6有不足，需更好模型。

Method: 引入COFFEE模型，结合状态反馈实现上下文依赖选择，采用高效模型参数化去除冗余。

Result: 在归纳头任务上，参数和训练序列少两个数量级达接近完美准确率；在MNIST上，相同架构下远超S6，3585参数达97%准确率。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的算法设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

Conclusion: 新基准有望弥合严格评估与现实应用之间的差距，为从业者和新手选择或扩展合适的CRL框架提供帮助。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Conclusion: 尽管有成本，降低不确定性可提高样本效率和最优策略价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Method: 提出MAHA，将密集向量检索与结构化图遍历相结合，知识图谱编码跨模态语义和关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE - L得分达0.486，实现完整模态覆盖。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展且可解释的检索框架，推动RAG系统在非结构化多模态数据上进行模态感知推理。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习和科学计算中开发保结构的微分方法提供基础。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Conclusion: IC-index可以有效评估DTA预测中交互方向的预测性能，有助于更全面地评估DTA预测方法。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Conclusion: TENDE方法能灵活、可扩展地估计转移熵，对底层数据生成过程假设少。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that
integrates data-driven domain as a constraint into the nonlinear programming

plant, our framework delivers domain-consistent robust optimal solutions that
achieve a verified 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency.

power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with
10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results
underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term,

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Conclusion: D - GCN是一种有效、可扩展的异构多跳无线网络饱和吞吐量预测方法。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of

TL;DR: 本文提出ProtGram - DirectGCN框架用于蛋白质 - 蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测，在标准节点分类基准和PPI预测中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质 - 蛋白质相互作用预测的计算机模拟方法计算量大，需探索计算量较小的替代方案。

Method: 提出两阶段图表示学习框架ProtGram - DirectGCN，先开发ProtGram将蛋白质一级结构建模为全局推断的n - 元语法图，再提出DirectGCN处理图信息并学习残基级嵌入，经注意力池化生成蛋白质级嵌入用于预测。

Result: DirectGCN在标准节点分类基准上表现与现有方法相当，在复杂有向图中表现出色，ProtGram - DirectGCN框架在PPI预测中即使训练数据有限也有强大预测能力。

Conclusion: ProtGram - DirectGCN框架为PPI预测提供了计算量较小且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Motivation: 解决最大似然IRT方法中非线性链接函数引入曲率破坏可加性的问题，寻求更优的大语言模型评估方法。

Method: 通过对TVD - MI的二元试验取平均得到适用于IRT的中心概率分数，推导基于基尼熵最大化的截尾线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘法。

Result: 恒等链接在三个领域中对原始数据的中值卷曲更低；在33%覆盖率下实现保留代理排名的低RMSE；法官稳健性分析显示代理排名强相关且恒等链接有优势。

Conclusion: TVD - MI的几何结构通过恒等映射在高效大语言模型评估中保存最好，也适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

Conclusion: 研究为优化基于排序的交易策略提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Motivation: 现有模型合并工作大多忽略模型压缩为低秩表示的情况，传统合并方法用于低秩权重会导致合并模型性能严重下降。

Method: 提出可逆模型合并（RMM）方法，构建紧凑基，通过线性组合恢复原始特定任务模型，提供选择模型权重最优基和任务特定系数的封闭形式解决方案。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型规模上的大量实验表明，RMM始终优于现有合并方法，显著保留了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: RMM是一种高效、无数据且灵活的模型合并方法，能有效解决低秩模型合并问题。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: MAFA弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似注释挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Conclusion: 扩散潜空间编码了与动力学相关的结构，利用该结构需要进行潜空间组织和沿潜流形遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Method: 先推导倒数第二层相对平面度的闭式表达式，用其约束输入空间损失变化，进而分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 平面度意味着局部但非全局对抗鲁棒性；要在局部邻域之外保持鲁棒性，损失需远离数据流形急剧弯曲；对抗样本常处于模型自信错误的大而平的区域。

Conclusion: 挑战了对平面度的简单看法，提供了其在鲁棒性中作用的细致理解。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型多为专业模型，虽有通用模型出现，但缺乏对通用和专业模型性能的全面比较，尤其是针对PPG信号。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: 需要能产生证据一致、稳定轨迹的模型以获临床医生信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,

### [146] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出谱残差储层计算（SR - RC）改进时间序列异常检测性能且不牺牲学习效率，在基准任务和真实数据集上表现优于传统方法，为边缘AI部署提供方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统储层计算（RC）在资源受限边缘设备上需大储层才能实现足够异常检测性能，注意力机制虽能提高准确性但计算量大且影响学习效率，需改进。

Method: 提出谱残差储层计算（SR - RC），将谱残差（SR）方法与RC集成。

Result: SR - RC在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上优于传统RC和基于SR方法提取值的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR - RC为将RC作为边缘AI用于时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TED++框架检测深度神经网络后门攻击，在多场景表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法在攻击者利用细微异常或干净样本稀缺时易受攻击，需新方法检测后门。

Method: 构建类隐藏特征流形的管状邻域，用局部自适应排序检测激活值，聚合各层排序判断输入。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上实验，TED++在自适应攻击和数据有限场景达最优检测性能，少量样本时检测性能近完美，AUROC比次优方法高14%。

Conclusion: TED++能有效检测逃避现有防御的微妙后门攻击，代码公开。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM - ERM框架解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性问题，理论分析并通过实验证明其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有程序学习算法要么搜索复杂度高，要么需要大量样本，寻求兼具样本效率和计算可行性的算法。

Method: 引入LLM - ERM框架，用预训练增强推理的LLM引导候选程序搜索，在保留ERM风格选择的同时避免穷举。

Result: 理论上表明坐标在线小批量SGD学习短程序需大量样本；实验中LLM - ERM用200样本解决多种任务，而SGD训练的变压器100000样本仍过拟合。

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习梯度训练难以触及的简洁假设提供实用途径。

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出当前图变换器（GTs）设计僵化且缺乏可量化解释性，提出DARTS - GT方法，通过不对称设计和架构搜索优化，还开发了可解释性框架，实验表明该方法性能好且更具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GTs存在设计僵化（各层采用固定GNN类型）和缺乏可量化解释性（复杂架构难以区分有意义模式和虚假相关性）的问题。

Method: 重新设计GT注意力，将结构编码与特征表示解耦；使用DARTS在每层选择最优GNN算子；通过因果消融开发首个GT可量化解释性框架。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，DARTS - GT在四个数据集上达到了最先进水平，在其他数据集上也具有竞争力；发现的架构显示出特定数据集的模式；可解释性分析表明视觉注意力显著性和因果重要性并不总是相关。

Conclusion: Graph Transformers不必在性能和可解释性之间做出选择，DARTS - GT的异构架构能产生更具可解释性的模型。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Stop - RAG解决迭代检索增强生成的停止问题并取得好效果


<details>

Motivation: 迭代检索增强生成存在增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的问题，现有停止策略不佳

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限水平马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于值的控制器Stop - RAG，用全宽前视Q(λ)目标训练

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop - RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的停止方法

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统缺失的关键组件，基于值的控制可提高RAG系统的准确性

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Result: 基于反馈的攻击使攻击成功率大幅提升，假奖励攻击增加了系统脆弱性，高亮防御可降低攻击成功率且不降低实用性。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道是重要攻击面，需为反馈通道和优化框架设置更强防护。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: 多模态学习存在模态不平衡问题，不仅在表征学习阶段，决策层也明显。实验显示模型有模态偏向，根源是特征空间和决策权重分布差异，建议未来系统在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制。

Motivation: 解决多模态学习中模态不平衡问题，即优势模态在联合优化时掩盖弱势模态。

Method: 在视听数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic - Sounds）上进行实验，分析特征空间和决策权重分布。

Result: 即使经过大量预训练和平衡优化，模型仍对某些模态（如音频）有系统偏向，偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布差异。

Conclusion: 未来多模态系统应在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，实现各模态相对平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Result: 在多个MoE模型上评估，MergeMoE算法在相同压缩比下始终优于基线。

Conclusion: 所提的MergeMoE方法能有效压缩MoE模型且性能表现良好。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Conclusion: 挑战了应不惜一切代价避免再训练的观点，为大语言模型剪枝后性能恢复提供重要见解。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Result: 训练稳定，生成样本能重现沉积物的非平稳性和细节，无模式崩溃或纯记忆训练数据问题，可用沉积时间监测和验证GAN性能。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上更稳健，探索深度生成模型利用地质原理有很大前景，其在更大3D图像和多模态数据集上的表现有待研究。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

Conclusion: MECo使分子设计具有一致性、可控性和可解释性，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作奠定基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Conclusion: ICA重加权框架有效，但存在对快速漂移的在线策略更新的局限性，后续将公布代码和提示，为未来工作指明方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因果发现算法在有限样本下表现差，且现有结合专家知识方法不可靠的问题。

Method: 提出Guess2Graph框架，用专家猜测指导统计测试顺序，开发PC - Guess和gPC - Guess两个实例。

Result: 理论上两种实例不受专家误差影响保持正确性，gPC - Guess在有限样本且专家表现好时表现更优；实证上两者随专家准确率单调提升，gPC - Guess提升更显著。

Conclusion: Guess2Graph框架能在保持统计一致性的同时提升因果发现算法性能。

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

### [162] [MX+: Pushing the Limits of Microscaling Formats for Efficient Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14557)
*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

TL;DR: 本文聚焦块浮点格式，分析其在大语言模型服务中的局限性，提出MX+扩展方案，评估显示其性能显著优于4位MX格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低精度数据格式在大语言模型服务中存在需软件框架大幅修改或硬件适配性差的问题，需挖掘块浮点格式潜力。

Method: 对行业驱动的块浮点格式变体进行综合分析，针对异常值提出MX+扩展方案，将指数域重新用作扩展尾数提高异常元素精度。

Result: MX+与4位MX格式相比，模型性能显著提高，存储开销和速度下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MX+为高效大语言模型推理提供了有吸引力的替代方案，可替代MXFP4或MXFP6。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出RedOUT框架用于图分类的测试时OOD检测，通过减少结构冗余提升性能，实验效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图OOD检测方法因结构冗余导致语义偏移，影响性能。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，引入ReGIB，分解目标，最小化结构熵，提出上下界优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验，RedOUT在OOD检测中表现优越，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对平均提升6.7%，超最佳竞品17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT能有效减少结构冗余，提升图分类OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在处理序列长度时复杂度为二次方，需探索更高效的序列模型。

Method: 研究使用双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型Hydra替代TabPFN中的Transformer，并探讨双向方法对效率和对称上下文聚合的影响。

Result: 该方法降低了顺序依赖，预测性能与原TabPFN模型具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Hydra可作为TabPFN中Transformer的替代方案，双向方法能降低顺序依赖并保证性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 获取大规模数据集高质量标签成本高，现有AI预测标签方法有误差，提出Conformal Labeling方法控制错误发现率以确保AI标签质量，实验显示效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有获取数据集标签方法成本高，AI预测标签有误差且现有选择性标注方法无理论保证，需解决AI标签质量问题。

Method: 引入Conformal Labeling方法，为每个测试实例构建保形p值，通过比较AI模型预测置信度与校准实例误标注情况，选择p值低于阈值的实例，保证AI预测可信。

Result: 该方法能将错误发现率控制在标称水平以下，在图像、文本标注和大语言模型问答等任务中实现了严格的错误发现率控制且有较高效力。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能有效控制AI标签的错误发现率，确保AI标签质量，具有良好的适用性。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Conclusion: Matcha是一种有效的蛋白质 - 配体结合姿势预测方法，代码可在GitHub获取。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变压器设计通信开销大，尤其是张量并行中的MHA - MLP连接需全归约通信。

Method: 提出FAL架构，将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层MLP输入；提出FAL+，将归一化的第一层注意力输出添加到后续层MHA输出以增强MLP输入。

Result: FAL最多减少44%多GPU训练时间，单GPU吞吐量最多提升1.18倍，困惑度优于基线GPT；FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下困惑度更低。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+架构能有效减少通信开销，提升训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Method: 提出基于条件流匹配的LeapFactual算法，采用模型无关方法，能处理有人参与的系统。

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上的实验表明，LeapFactual能生成准确且分布内的反事实解释，可靠的反事实样本可作为新训练数据增强模型。

Conclusion: 该方法应用广泛，能促进科学知识发现和非专家可解释性。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能保留源和目标分布的均值和协方差结构，为跨域比较提供更可靠度量。

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Method: 提出Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA)方法渐进对齐客户公共层权重与全局模型权重，还将基于熵的加权平均集成到FedPPA框架。

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR - 10三个图像分类数据集上实验，FedPPA始终优于现有联邦学习算法。

Conclusion: FedPPA能减轻全局和局部模型不一致性，保留客户本地知识，增强非IID设置下个性化鲁棒性，在个性化适应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Motivation: 传统SIMT编程模型与任务并行硬件不匹配，手动编排复杂且易出错，需解决编程差距问题。

Method: 提出新颖的IR抽象异步引用（aref），自动将程序划分为生产者 - 消费者角色并管理数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核有1.1倍加速，注意力工作负载上比Triton快1.2倍，编程工作量远低于手动优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention - 3内核。

Conclusion: Tawa能实现高硬件利用率，为开发者减轻编程负担，提高编程效率和程序性能。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

Result: 在人形行走、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理三个DRL代理上评估，在自动驾驶和停车场景中比INDAGO分别多发现83%和40%独特故障，在所有代理上减少故障时间最多达67%

Conclusion: INDAGO - Nexus在发现独特故障和减少故障时间上优于INDAGO

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Result: 3B和8B参数模型的大规模预训练实验表明，FSP在数学、推理和编码基准测试上优于NTP和MTP。

Conclusion: FSP是一种有效的方法，能在长程推理等任务上提供比NTP和MTP更好的表现。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

TL;DR: 提出SPHeRe无监督学习方法，在图像分类等任务表现优，展示Hebbian无监督学习规则潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hebbian学习用于机器学习时，连接更新无约束、缺乏反馈调解，限制其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: 引入SPHeRe方法，通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保存，结构信息保存损失通过辅助轻量级投影反向传播到输入，正交约束控制更新幅度。

Result: SPHeRe在标准图像分类基准上达SOTA，在持续学习、迁移学习场景有效，图像重建任务展示特征鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 证明Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，表明可开发不依赖严格反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

TL;DR: 提出置换增强动态稀疏训练（PA - DST）方法，在ImageNet - 1K和WikiText - 103上匹配非结构化基线，训练和推理更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏在精度上落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，原因是表达能力不足，希望缩小这一差距。

Method: 为每层学习一个置换矩阵并与结构化权重矩阵联合学习，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种结构。

Result: PA - DST在90 - 95%稀疏度下匹配非结构化基线，训练速度最高达1.21倍，推理速度最高达2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构 + 学习的置换是准确性和效率之间的最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: ShifTS框架在解决时间序列分布偏移问题上有效，可提升预测精度。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的方法提供了一种灵活的端到端学习可解释表示的范式，特征和预测易于检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Result: 工具增强的SSMs在算术、推理和编码等多种任务上实现显著的长度泛化。

Conclusion: SSMs在基于交互式工具和智能体设置中，有潜力成为Transformer的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: 端到端学习理论在真实数据集上的非平凡学习算法中是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Result: 在独立同分布输入条件下，建立了次线性遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索算法能有效确保学习代理在高风险环境下的安全部署。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Result: 在多种单步任务中，算法大幅提升推理能力，接近甚至超越强化学习，且避免了多样性坍塌。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural
Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software
co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a
promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages
in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing,
making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing
optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent
complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware
constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs,
emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the
state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly
applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state-of-the-art in
SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future
research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of
hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This
survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners
in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance
of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic
computing.

Motivation: 研究在调度器只能每隔T时间获取队列长度的情况下，含n个并行单服务器队列且服务率异构的负载均衡系统的稳定性和延迟最优性。

Method: 考虑基于上次访问队列时缩放队列长度顺序和各服务器处理速率进行调度决策的策略。

Result: 给出系统稳定的易验证的充要条件和重负载延迟最优的充分条件，证明重负载下队列长度依分布收敛到缩放的确定性向量，缩放因子为指数随机变量。

Conclusion: 为特定调度策略下的负载均衡系统的稳定性和性能分析提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues
working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central
dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon
arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the
dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of
time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order
of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and
on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide
easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the
system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also
show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a
scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random
variable.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型智能体从原型到生产中存在的“工艺危机”，使智能体在关键任务应用中更可靠。

Method: 引入治理优先范式，提出名为ArbiterOS的正式架构。

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 指出危机源于范式不匹配，治理优先范式和ArbiterOS架构可解决危机。

Abstract: The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an ``Age
of the Agent,'' enabling autonomous systems to tackle complex goals. However,
the transition from prototype to production is hindered by a pervasive ``crisis
of craft,'' resulting in agents that are brittle, unpredictable, and ultimately
untrustworthy in mission-critical applications. This paper argues this crisis
stems from a fundamental paradigm mismatch -- attempting to command inherently
probabilistic processors with the deterministic mental models of traditional
software engineering. To solve this crisis, we introduce a governance-first
paradigm for principled agent engineering, embodied in a formal architecture we
call ArbiterOS.

Motivation: 现有基准多为单轮任务，无法反映真实开发的迭代性质，需系统评估多轮编码场景下代码的正确性和安全性。

Method: 构建MT - Sec基准，用合成数据管道将单轮任务转为多轮交互序列，评估32个开源和闭源模型及3个代理脚手架。

Result: 多轮场景下“正确且安全”输出下降20 - 27%，代码差异生成表现更差，代理脚手架在多轮评估中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 有必要开发能联合评估多轮真实编码工作流中代码正确性和安全性的基准。

Abstract: AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed
software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing
benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they
are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative
nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to
systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding
scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms
existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction
sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity
of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models,
and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in
"correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even
among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate
models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically
relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased
rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that
while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they
are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings
highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and
security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.

Motivation: 现有大模型生成的网页界面常存在可访问性缺陷，无法满足不同用户需求，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入A11yn方法，优化新的奖励函数惩罚违反WCAG准则的行为，构建UIReq - 6.8K数据集用于训练，引入RealUIReq - 300基准用于评估。

Result: A11yn显著优于强基线，相比基础模型将不可访问率降低60%，同时保持生成界面的语义保真度和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 大模型中可系统优化可访问性，代码生成与可访问性对齐是可行的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating functional and aesthetic web interfaces directly from
instructions. However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from
their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse
needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method
that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant
web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the
severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To
support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse
instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300,
a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated
from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results
show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the
Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic
fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that
accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the
feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入软件开发，后门攻击成威胁，检测困难，现有频谱特征防御方法对代码模型效果可能不佳，需重新评估其适用性。

Method: 系统评估频谱特征防御方法在不同攻击场景和防御配置下的有效性，分析其优缺点，探索关键因素不同设置的影响。

Result: 发现代码后门检测中频谱特征的常用设置往往不是最优的，找到一个能更准确估计其实际性能的新代理指标。

Conclusion: 基于频谱特征的防御方法在代码模型后门攻击检测中的常用设置有待优化，新代理指标有助于更准确评估其性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks.
Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to
manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data.
Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the
use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by
analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works
have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks,
recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for
code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral
Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We
systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and
defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found
that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection
is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the
key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate
the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the
defense.

TL;DR: 论文探讨程序中反复出现的重复模式漏洞（RPBs），介绍基于LLVM和大语言模型的BugStone系统，能利用已修复实例识别潜在漏洞，在Linux内核和数据集上有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修复大型程序中的漏洞耗时费力，且相似代码段可能存在未发现的重复漏洞，漏洞报告还可能扩大攻击面，因此研究RPBs。

Method: 引入BugStone程序分析系统，利用LLVM和大语言模型，通过已修复的RPB实例识别错误模式，在整个程序中查找类似的易受攻击代码段。

Result: 在Linux内核中从135个独特的RPBs识别出超22K个新潜在问题，400个手动分析中有246个有效；在数据集上，即使选择成本效益高的模型，BugStone也达到92.2%的精度和79.1%的成对准确率。

Conclusion: RPBs广泛存在且严重影响软件安全，BugStone系统能有效识别程序中的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial
time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project
maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the
issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,
which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and
fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more
concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they
provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other
parts of the program.
  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear
repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different
programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our
investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise
the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program
analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key
observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged
to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By
examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify
similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,
BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.
Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also
created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier
conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring
patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice,
BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.

Motivation: 解决NL - to - Scenic生成中数据稀缺、可重复性有限和指标不一致的问题。

Method: 引入NL2Scenic数据集和框架，用多种文本和执行指标评估13个模型，并与专家研究对比。

Result: EDIT - SIM与人类判断相关性最好，GPT - 4o表现最佳，Qwen2.5Coder - 14B接近其得分，FSER提升小模型，中等规模后收益递减。

Conclusion: NL2Scenic和EDIT - COMP为评估Scenic代码生成提供基础，中等开源模型实用且具成本效益。

Abstract: Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic,
a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible
scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs)
suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We
introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a
difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14
prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four
proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine
open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using
text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics
(compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11).
EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of
EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking
fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88
percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting,
Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and
scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder
outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a
standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and
indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options
for autonomous-driving scenario programming.

Method: Caruca先利用大语言模型将命令的用户文档转换为结构化调用语法，探索语法有效的命令调用和执行环境空间，具体执行命令 - 环境对，在系统调用和文件系统层面插入以提取关键命令属性。

Result: 在60个GNU Coreutils、POSIX和第三方命令上应用，除一个案例外都生成了正确规范，消除了手动工作，为一个先进的静态分析工具提供了完整规范。

Conclusion: Caruca系统能够有效自动挖掘不透明命令的规范，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: A wealth of state-of-the-art systems demonstrate impressive improvements in
performance, security, and reliability on programs composed of opaque
components, such as Unix shell commands. To reason about commands, these
systems require partial specifications. However, creating such specifications
is a manual, laborious, and error-prone process, limiting the practicality of
these systems. This paper presents Caruca, a system for automatic specification
mining for opaque commands. To overcome the challenge of language diversity
across commands, Caruca first instruments a large language model to translate a
command's user-facing documentation into a structured invocation syntax. Using
this representation, Caruca explores the space of syntactically valid command
invocations and execution environments. Caruca concretely executes each
command-environment pair, interposing at the system-call and filesystem level
to extract key command properties such as parallelizability and filesystem pre-
and post-conditions. These properties can be exported in multiple specification
formats and are immediately usable by existing systems. Applying Caruca across
60 GNU Coreutils, POSIX, and third-party commands across several
specification-dependent systems shows that Caruca generates correct
specifications for all but one case, completely eliminating manual effort from
the process and currently powering the full specifications for a
state-of-the-art static analysis tool.

Motivation: 编译器通行证自动调优中寻找特定程序的最优通行证序列是NP难题，传统通用优化标志难以挖掘程序全部性能潜力。

Method: 提出混合知识引导进化框架，离线构建包含四个关键组件的编译知识库，在线使用定制遗传算法和知识注入的遗传算子。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上，比高度优化的opt -Oz基线平均多减少11.0%的LLVM IR指令。

Conclusion: 该框架在发现个性化、高性能优化序列方面具有先进能力。

Abstract: Compiler pass auto-tuning is critical for enhancing software performance, yet
finding the optimal pass sequence for a specific program is an NP-hard problem.
Traditional, general-purpose optimization flags like -O3 and -Oz adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to unlock a program's full
performance potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid,
Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework. This framework intelligently guides
online, personalized optimization using knowledge extracted from a large-scale
offline analysis phase. During the offline stage, we construct a comprehensive
compilation knowledge base composed of four key components: (1) Pass Behavioral
Vectors to quantitatively capture the effectiveness of each optimization; (2)
Pass Groups derived from clustering these vectors based on behavior similarity;
(3) a Synergy Pass Graph to model beneficial sequential interactions; and (4) a
library of Prototype Pass Sequences evolved for distinct program types. In the
online stage, a bespoke genetic algorithm leverages this rich knowledge base
through specially designed, knowledge-infused genetic operators. These
operators transform the search by performing semantically-aware recombination
and targeted, restorative mutations. On a suite of seven public datasets, our
framework achieves an average of 11.0% additional LLVM IR instruction reduction
over the highly-optimized opt -Oz baseline, demonstrating its state-of-the-art
capability in discovering personalized, high-performance optimization
sequences.

Conclusion: Nettle和Nettle - Eval能有效解决在线编程中的TLE错误，框架可靠。

Abstract: Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions
of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry
interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)
error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although
designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error
messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and
existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon
their submissions after repeated TLE failures.
  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in
online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE
errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix
them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient
algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and
inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely
performance issues.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair
tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework
for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback
generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code
edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same
1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the
strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the
platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.

Conclusion: PathFix能有效应对现有自动化程序修复方法的挑战，提升修复性能。

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable
defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness.
However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing
APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch
candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages
path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate
patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy
program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the
fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First,
it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second,
it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the
control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads
to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by
solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the
correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and
mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate
a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that
PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex
program structures such as loops and recursion.

Abstract: The stakeholders involved in software development are becoming increasingly
diverse, with both human contributors from varied backgrounds and AI-powered
agents collaborating together in the process. This situation presents unique
governance challenges, particularly in Open-Source Software (OSS) projects,
where explicit policies are often lacking or unclear. This paper presents the
vision and foundational concepts for a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
designed to define and enforce rich governance policies in systems involving
diverse stakeholders, including agents. This DSL offers a pathway towards more
robust, adaptable, and ultimately automated governance, paving the way for more
effective collaboration in software projects, especially OSS ones.

Motivation: 现有基于静态数据集的测试生成方法有“固定难度上限”，难以发现训练范围外的新的或更复杂的错误。

Result: ATGen显著优于现有技术基线，可作为更好的Best - of - N推理过滤器和更高质量的代码生成模型训练奖励源。

Conclusion: 建立了提高大语言模型生成代码可靠性的新动态范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs
often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical
bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or
supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a
``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover
novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we
introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial
reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code
generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy.
This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging
current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to
learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling
of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical
utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N
inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation
models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the
reliability of LLM-generated code.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在自动Web漏洞复现这一关键应用上研究不足，需评估其在该场景的适用性。

Method: 系统评估20个来自不同领域的代理在16个维度上的表现，对3种代表性Web漏洞进行测试，选取3个表现最佳的代理在80个真实世界的CVE数据集上深入评估。

Result: LLM代理在简单基于库的漏洞上有一定成功率，但在复杂基于服务的漏洞上失败，对输入指导敏感，认证信息不完整时性能下降超33%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理能力与可靠自动漏洞复现需求存在显著差距，需提升环境适应和自主解决问题的能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in software engineering and cybersecurity tasks, including code generation,
vulnerability discovery, and automated testing. One critical but underexplored
application is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms
vulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest
promising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web
vulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web
vulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software
engineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including
technical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors,
on 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three
top-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation
on our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types
and 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve
reasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently
fail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component
environments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers
create a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual
vulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with
performance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.
Our findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent
capabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,
emphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous
problem-solving capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链攻击对软件安全威胁大，自动化工具检测恶意代码注入复杂，需新方法。

Method: 提出基于名称预测的内聚（NPC）指标，量化源代码内聚破坏，分析恶意代码引入时函数内聚变化和命名模式。

Result: 分析369个开源C++仓库54,707个函数，发现代码注入降低内聚、使命名变短且描述性变差；在极端测试集不平衡下，监测高内聚函数能有效检测注入代码，1:1,000比例下Precision@100为36.41%，1:10,000比例下为12.47%。

Conclusion: 自动化内聚测量，尤其是基于名称预测的内聚，有助于识别供应链攻击，提高源代码完整性。

Abstract: Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious
code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may
have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated
tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of
both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an
unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying
cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion
(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is
introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707
functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection
reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive
names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of
real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme
test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC
can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100
of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that
automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based
cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving
source code integrity.

Motivation: 传统上代码库从一种ISA迁移到另一种主要关注静态和动态二进制翻译，但现代ISA迁移可基于开源生态系统从头重新编译软件，带来新挑战，而学术界对此关注有限。

Method: 分析谷歌近40000次代码提交的从x86到Arm的大规模迁移。

Result: 得出ISA迁移的任务分类，展示谷歌如何自动化迁移步骤，说明AI在自动处理这些任务中的重要作用。

Conclusion: 识别出仍具挑战性的任务，强调值得进一步关注的研究挑战。

Abstract: Migrating codebases from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another is
a major engineering challenge. A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in
addition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has
seen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on
static and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom
has been that this is the primary challenge.
  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations
can often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to
recompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and
multifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.
  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning
almost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA
migration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and
demonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these
tasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research
challenges that warrant further attention.

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验研究，揭示了单遍SGD在多各向异性类数据高维优化问题中的动态特性和结构相变。

Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics
on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic
classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the
limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in
terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing
theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large
(growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in
detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in
the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study
three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large
fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance
matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there
exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for
the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD
tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected
onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is
supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the
exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.

Result: 混合光学 - 雷达和纯光学方法精度高，优于最新混合方法，混合法在稀疏光学数据下更稳健。

Conclusion: 所开发的森林砍伐检测管道有效，混合方法在特定场景有优势。

Abstract: In this paper we develop a deforestation detection pipeline that incorporates
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A crucial component of the
pipeline is the construction of anomaly maps of the optical data, which is done
using the residual space of a discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion.
Anomalies are quantified using a concentration bound on the distribution of the
residual components for the nominal state of the forest. This bound does not
require prior knowledge on the distribution of the data. This is in contrast to
statistical parametric methods that assume knowledge of the data distribution,
an impractical assumption that is especially infeasible for high dimensional
data such as ours. Once the optical anomaly maps are computed they are combined
with SAR data, and the state of the forest is classified by using a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). We test our approach with Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2
(Optical) data on a $92.19\,km \times 91.80\,km$ region in the Amazon forest.
The results show that both the hybrid optical-radar and optical only methods
achieve high accuracy that is superior to the recent state-of-the-art hybrid
method. Moreover, the hybrid method is significantly more robust in the case of
sparse optical data that are common in highly cloudy regions.

Conclusion: HD - BWDM为现代高维应用中的非参数聚类提供了理论可靠、计算高效的停止规则。

Abstract: Determining the appropriate number of clusters in unsupervised learning is a
central problem in statistics and data science. Traditional validity indices
such as Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, and Davies-Bouldin-depend on
centroid-based distances and therefore degrade in high-dimensional or
contaminated data. This paper proposes a new robust, nonparametric clustering
validation framework, the High-Dimensional Between-Within Distance Median
(HD-BWDM), which extends the recently introduced BWDM criterion to
high-dimensional spaces. HD-BWDM integrates random projection and principal
component analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and applies trimmed
clustering and medoid-based distances to ensure robustness against outliers. We
derive theoretical results showing consistency and convergence under
Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
HD-BWDM remains stable and interpretable under high-dimensional projections and
contamination, providing a robust alternative to traditional centroid-based
validation criteria. The proposed method provides a theoretically grounded,
computationally efficient stopping rule for nonparametric clustering in modern
high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss
function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify
the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the
estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the
quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true
data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the
achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information
Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms
with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel
approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the
input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive
noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information
Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the
condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in
practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth
assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical
performance metrics.

Conclusion: 行融合是大规模个性化联邦多元学习的有效透明范式，弥合逐元素和矩阵融合公式间差距。

Abstract: We study personalized federated learning for multivariate responses where
client models are heterogeneous yet share variable-level structure. Existing
entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion
over-couples clients. We propose a Sparse Row-wise Fusion (SROF) regularizer
that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, and
we develop RowFed, a communication-efficient federated algorithm that embeds
SROF into a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial
participation. Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for
SROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic
normality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under
random client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves
with participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous
regimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error
and strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a
personalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates
these gains while preserving interpretability. Together, our results position
row-wise fusion as an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale
personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between
entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations.

Conclusion: LOAD是一种有效结合局部和全局方法优势的因果发现方法。

Abstract: Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect
estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal
graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole
causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets,
i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become
computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal
discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local
neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically
suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments
Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines
the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality
of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the
targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local
information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by
leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents.
Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the
learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data
LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate
effect estimation than local methods.

Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) with
discontinuous coefficients are fundamental challenges in modeling complex
spatiotemporal systems with heterogeneous structures and uncertain dynamics.
Traditional numerical and machine learning approaches often face limitations in
addressing these problems due to high dimensionality, inherent nonlinearity,
and discontinuous parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a novel
computational framework that synergistically integrates physics-informed deep
learning with Bayesian inference for accurate parameter identification in PDEs
with jump discontinuities in coefficients. The core innovation of our framework
lies in a dual-network architecture employing a gradient-adaptive weighting
strategy: a main network approximates PDE solutions while a sub network samples
its coefficients. To effectively identify mixture structures in parameter
spaces, we employ Markovian dynamics methods to capture hidden state
transitions of complex spatiotemporal systems. The framework has applications
in reconstruction of solutions and identification of parameter-varying regions.
Comprehensive numerical experiments on various PDEs with jump-varying
coefficients demonstrate the framework's exceptional adaptability, accuracy,
and robustness compared to existing methods. This study provides a
generalizable computational approach of parameter identification for PDEs with
discontinuous parameter structures, particularly in non-stationary or
heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD

probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods,
our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations
while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by
using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be
estimated without probability density samples, and by using a conditional
goodness-of-fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. We demonstrate the

TL;DR: 提出用于最优实验设计的几何框架，以解决传统方法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于互信息的最优实验设计方法依赖概率密度，不变性属性受限。

Method: 提出基于最优传输理论的互传输依赖（MTD）作为优化设计的几何目标，可根据下游估计问题选择合适几何。

Result: 框架能产生高质量设计。

Conclusion: 该框架是标准信息论技术的灵活替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometric framework for optimal experimental design
(OED). Traditional OED approaches, such as those based on mutual information,
rely explicitly on probability densities, leading to restrictive invariance
properties. To address these limitations, we propose the mutual transport
dependence (MTD), a measure of statistical dependence grounded in optimal
transport theory which provides a geometric objective for optimizing designs.
Unlike conventional approaches, the MTD can be tailored to specific downstream
estimation problems by choosing appropriate geometries on the underlying
spaces. We demonstrate that our framework produces high-quality designs while
offering a flexible alternative to standard information-theoretic techniques.

TL;DR: 提出基于HSACC的不完整多视图聚类框架，实验显示性能超现有方法，消融和参数分析验证有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图聚类方法处理不完整多视图数据有局限，现有深度方法存在融合结果不佳和误差传播问题。

Method: 设计双级语义空间实现跨视图融合，在低级别语义空间最大化互信息确保一致性，高级别语义空间基于分布相似度动态分配视图权重并加权融合；通过投影对齐的潜在表示隐式恢复缺失视图，联合优化重建和聚类目标。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，消融研究验证机制有效性，参数分析证实模型对超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的HSACC框架有效解决不完整多视图聚类问题，性能和鲁棒性良好。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some
samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering
methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely
on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal
fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on
Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC
achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design.
In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing
mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive
view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity
between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by
weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally,
HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent
representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes
reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of
completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and
dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's
robustness to hyperparameter variations.

Motivation: 现有域适应方法在目标域可靠性差，在医学图像分割中尤其关键，时空数据缺乏时间一致性、超声心动图存在伪影和噪声会影响分割性能。

Conclusion: RL4Seg3D能提高分割的准确性、解剖学有效性和时间一致性，还提供可靠的不确定性估计器。

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究提出基于乳腺密度的多模态AI框架用于乳腺癌检测，该框架性能优于单一模态，可克服单模态筛查局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺钼靶在致密乳腺组织女性中灵敏度降低，导致漏诊或延迟诊断，探究基于乳腺密度的多模态AI框架能否改善癌症检测。

Method: 324名女性接受钼靶和热成像检查，用多视图深度学习模型分析钼靶图像，通过血管和热辐射组学评估热成像，框架根据组织类型选择合适成像方式。

Result: 多模态AI框架灵敏度94.55%，特异性79.93%，优于单一钼靶AI和Thermalytix AI，Thermalytix AI在不同乳腺组织中灵敏度稳定。

Conclusion: 密度信息的多模态AI框架可克服单模态筛查局限，在不同乳腺组成中表现良好，且可解释、低成本、易部署。

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
(sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
(92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
high-resource and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced significantly through deep learning,
reinforcement learning, and large language and vision models. However, these
systems often remain task specific, struggle to adapt to changing conditions,
and cannot generalize in ways similar to human cognition. Additionally, they
mainly focus on mimicking brain structures, which often leads to black-box
models with limited transparency and adaptability. Inspired by the structure
and function of biological cognition, this paper introduces the concept of
"Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence (NII)," a hybrid approach that combines
neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, and AI to develop more
general, adaptive, and robust intelligent systems capable of rapid learning,
learning from less data, and leveraging prior experience. These systems aim to
emulate the human brain's ability to flexibly learn, reason, remember,
perceive, and act in real-world settings with minimal supervision. We review
the limitations of current AI methods, define core principles of
neurocognitive-inspired intelligence, and propose a modular, biologically
inspired architecture that emphasizes integration, embodiment, and
adaptability. We also discuss potential implementation strategies and outline
various real-world applications, from robotics to education and healthcare.
Importantly, this paper offers a hybrid roadmap for future research, laying the
groundwork for building AI systems that more closely resemble human cognition.

Result: 基线CNN表现中等，混合CNN+SVM准确率和AUC更高，结果更平衡。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和传统机器学习方法能提高基于MRI的ASD研究的可靠性。

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is most often diagnosed using behavioral
evaluations, which can vary between clinicians. Brain imaging, combined with
machine learning, may help identify more objective patterns linked to ASD. This
project used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the publicly available
ABIDE I dataset (n = 1,112) to test two approaches for classifying ASD and
control participants. The first was a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)
trained end-to-end. The second was a hybrid approach that used the CNN as a
feature extractor and then applied a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.
The baseline CNN reached moderate performance (accuracy = 0.66, AUC = 0.70),
while the hybrid CNN + SVM achieved higher overall accuracy (0.76) and AUC
(0.80). The hybrid model also produced more balanced results between ASD and
control groups. Separating feature extraction and classification improved
performance and reduced bias between diagnostic groups. These findings suggest
that combining deep learning and traditional machine learning methods could
enhance the reliability of MRI-based research on ASD.

Conclusion: 稀疏交互的交叉监督网络可作为大脑表征学习和集体计算的算法框架。

Abstract: Brains learn to represent information from a large set of stimuli, typically
by weak supervision. Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for
exploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations.
Accordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design
principle of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation
is unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks
yields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification
or decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We
suggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may
underlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by
ensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into
an abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other
networks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal
proximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small
``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the
networks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network
architectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising
networks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that
decoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of
single networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal
for small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is
nearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We
thus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as
an algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective
computation in the brain.

Result: 到2011年，埃及实际GDP超合成反事实64%，人均收入超82%；约旦实际GDP高75%，人均收入高超20%；两国经济增长机制不同。

Conclusion: 和平协议能带来巨大、持久且异质性的增长红利。

Abstract: This paper provides the first causal evidence on the long-run economic
dividends of Arab-Israeli peace treaties. Using synthetic control and
difference-in-synthetic control estimators, we analyze 1978 Camp David Accords
and 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel. Both cases reveal large and
lasting gains. By 2011, real GDP of Egypt exceeded its synthetic counterfactual
by 64 percent, and per capita income by 82 percent. Jordanian trajectory shows
similarly permanent improvements, with real GDP higher by 75 percent and per
capita income by more than 20 percent. The mechanisms differ: in Egypt, gains
stem from a sharp fiscal reallocation together with higher foreign direct
investment and improved institutional credibility, while Jordan benefited
primarily through enhanced trade and financial inflows. Robustness and placebo
tests confirm the uniqueness of these effects. The results demonstrate that
peace agreements yield large, durable, and heterogeneous growth dividends.

Motivation: 探究医疗补助覆盖如何影响幸福感，分析医保后高低医疗支出哪个更能改善心理健康。

Method: 使用工具变量（IV）回归，对按支出水平和幸福评级划分的子组进行六次单独回归。

Result: 参保显著降低不幸福概率；降低高支出人群相当幸福概率，提高低支出人群该概率；仅对低支出人群非常幸福概率有积极影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果与医疗补助减轻经济负担、促进不同子群体福祉的益处相符。

Abstract: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to
examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among
low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from
comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous
studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited
a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not
receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage
impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in
healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or
lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression,
I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by
expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct
patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of
experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low
medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty
happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among
those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the
OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its
effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with
the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the
well-being of distinct subgroups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically
accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in
computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely
limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this
bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable
sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary
variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel
transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain,
revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive
acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables
admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient
exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately
reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$
algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock
time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a
long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work
provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens
avenues for physics-inspired generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于手持设备或网络摄像头在普通硬件上的实时语义分割，也能部署其他现成模型进行近实时深度估计。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Conclusion: PL - SE - ADA框架在医学图像域协调和可解释性表示学习方面有良好效果。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Motivation: 传统视觉模型在遥感领域受限于大量特定领域标注数据和复杂环境上下文理解能力，VLMs在遥感中的应用未充分探索，因此研究结合两者以提升遥感图像分析能力。

Method: 将YOLO与LLaVA、ChatGPT和Gemini等VLMs集成，在标注和未标注遥感数据以及退化图像场景下评估性能。

Result: 飞机检测和计数的平均MAE提高48.46%，遥感图像综合理解的CLIPScore提高6.17%。

Conclusion: 所提出的结合传统视觉模型和VLMs的方法为更先进高效的遥感图像分析，特别是少样本学习场景，奠定了基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌筛状形态预后差且病理学家报告不足、观察者间差异大，需开发AI系统改善检测。

Method: 用EfficientNetV2 - S编码器和多实例学习创建深度学习模型，在多个队列数据上训练，进行内部和外部验证，与九位专家病理学家对比。

Result: 模型内部和外部验证表现良好，在与病理学家对比中平均一致性最高。

Conclusion: AI模型在筛状形态检测上达病理学家水平，可增强诊断可靠性、规范报告和改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Method: 提出噪声投影器，对初始噪声进行文本条件细化；通过VLM获取图像反馈，提炼信号到奖励模型，用准直接偏好优化噪声投影器。

Result: 所提方法无需参考图像或手工先验，推理成本小，用单次前向传播替代多样本选择。

Conclusion: 提示感知噪声投影在不同提示下改善了文本图像对齐。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Motivation: MAE预训练视觉变压器在低标签场景表现好，但计算成本高，在工业场景不实用。

Method: 将Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，选择性应用于编码器。

Result: 在ImageNet - 1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，减少21.1%的训练时间、降低21.4%的碳排放、提升1.1点分割mIoU；在专有工业数据上有类似提升。

Conclusion: DBP可减少大规模ViT预训练的训练时间和能源消耗，同时提升下游性能。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立时空序列，未考虑外部环境和内部路线选择行为，提出PRTraj框架以弥补此不足。

Method: PRTraj先引入环境感知模块，从周边POI分布捕获多粒度环境语义来增强道路网络；再用路线选择编码器将轨迹中路段转换建模为决策序列，捕获路线选择行为；最后聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实数据集的5个下游任务上验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化性，且在少样本场景下性能稳健。

Conclusion: PRTraj框架能有效解决现有轨迹表示学习方法的问题，是一种可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Method: 提出深度学习框架，对皮肤病变分类并量化ABCD特征，模拟E特征，可视化ABCD特征轨迹，用HAM10000数据集实验。

Result: 分类准确率约89%，黑色素瘤AUC为0.96，特征评估在预测不对称性、颜色变化和直径方面表现良好，但边界不规则性建模较难。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架可让医生将ML诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，增进对皮肤癌进展的理解。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效，可用于DVOC任务，相关数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 模型能稳定优化并提高时间连贯性，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Result: 在基准数据集E - VQA和InfoSeek上答案质量显著提升，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 所提Wiki - PRF方法有效提升了KB - VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: Terra在重建和生成任务中表现出色，具有高3D一致性。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑模型训练范式，性能与有监督模型相当且优于RL技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖输入 - 目标对的监督微调，自然配对数据难大规模整理，合成训练对会传播预训练模型伪影。

Method: 直接优化几步扩散模型，训练时展开并利用视觉 - 语言模型反馈，引入分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无配对数据下性能与有监督模型相当，优于基于RL的技术。

Conclusion: 提出的新训练范式无需配对数据，能有效进行图像编辑模型训练。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Motivation: 指令式图像编辑向视频扩展因构建大规模成对视频编辑数据集成本高、复杂度大而探索不足。

Method: 利用未配对视频片段的上下文学习进行低成本预训练，预训练后用少量高质量成对编辑数据微调。

Result: 在指令对齐和视觉保真度上超越现有方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略有效，能提升指令式视频编辑效果。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Result: 在三个基准场景评估，召回率90.3% - 96.4%，减少专家检查面积达99.8%。

Conclusion: 方法不依赖标记训练数据，为未来太空机器辅助海洋哺乳动物监测提供可扩展的第一步。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Conclusion: 所提基于无条件扩散模型的方法能有效重建火星表面，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Result: PRISM在五年总生存率预测上表现优异，AUC=0.70 ± 0.04，准确率68.37% ± 4.75%，HR = 3.34，优于现有结直肠癌特定方法和AI基础模型；表现出性别无关的稳健性，在不同临床病理亚组中性能稳定。

Conclusion: PRISM模型在结直肠癌预后评估中具有良好性能和稳定性，有应用价值。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测意义重大，但CT扫描检测小或早期肿瘤难，AI模型训练需大量昂贵的人工绘制肿瘤掩码，而临床CT扫描的医学报告信息丰富却未充分利用。

Method: 引入R - Super方法，训练AI根据医学报告描述来分割肿瘤。

Result: 用101,654份报告训练的AI模型性能与用723个掩码训练的相当，结合报告和掩码使灵敏度提高13%、特异性提高8%，在7种肿瘤中的5种检测上超过放射科医生，还实现了此前无公开掩码或AI模型的多种肿瘤分割。

Conclusion: 挑战了大规模、劳动密集型肿瘤掩码创建不可或缺的观点，为不同肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了可扩展且可行的途径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

Conclusion: RealDPO和RealAction - 5K能有效解决视频生成模型在复杂动作生成上的问题，提升生成效果。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Motivation: 现有基于点图的3D重建方法用于动态场景结果不准确，因移动物体违反多视图几何约束。

Result: 框架实现完整4D恢复，在深度估计、相机位姿估计和点跟踪等下游任务表现良好。

Conclusion: C4D框架有效解决单目视频动态场景4D恢复问题。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Conclusion: 本文方法在实现高身份保真度的同时，能进行富有表现力的可控生成。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Conclusion: NEO可作为可扩展且强大的原生VLMs的基石，其丰富可复用组件能构建经济高效且可扩展的生态系统。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为多视图一致编辑的通用解决方案。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the

TL;DR: 介绍了一种光通信内计算（OCiC）框架，可减少端到端延迟，实现低延迟远程手术，开启分布式医疗智能新光学前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电子AI架构在远程手术中因推理和通信串行处理的延迟受限，影响实时AI可靠性和患者安全。

Method: 引入OCiC框架，将光学远程计算单元（ORCUs）集成到光通信路径，通过光谱高效二维光子卷积实现高速运算。

Result: 系统在分类和冠状动脉造影分割上保持高推理保真度，减轻累积误差传播，户外暗光纤部署验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OCiC可将长距离光纤基础设施转变为具有百亿亿次计算潜力的分布式光子AI网络，实现可靠、低延迟的远程手术。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing
intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical
separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI
and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain
fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of
inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in
latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays
over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here,
we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that
reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference
concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote
Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with
each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per
channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The
system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines
on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically
mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical
network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark
fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying
environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre
infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential,
enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and
opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在协变量调整ROC曲线评估生物标志物方面的应用很少被探索，本文旨在提出基于神经网络的协变量调整ROC建模框架。

Method: 提出框架，通过广泛模拟测试研究有限样本性能，在临床案例中评估TAC作为生物标志物预测死亡率。

Result: 分层分析显示协变量对死亡率结果有不同影响。

Conclusion: 强调协变量调整建模在生物标志物评估中的重要性，突出TAC基于个体特征作为功能能力生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its summary measure,
the Area Under the Curve (AUC), are well-established tools for evaluating the
efficacy of biomarkers in biomedical studies. Compared to the traditional ROC
curve, the covariate-adjusted ROC curve allows for individual evaluation of the
biomarker. However, the use of machine learning models has rarely been explored
in this context, despite their potential to develop more powerful and
sophisticated approaches for biomarker evaluation. The goal of this paper is to
propose a framework for neural network-based covariate-adjusted ROC modeling
that allows flexible and nonlinear evaluation of the effectiveness of a
biomarker to discriminate between two reference populations. The finite-sample
performance of our method is investigated through extensive simulation tests
under varying dependency structures between biomarkers, covariates, and
referenced populations. The methodology is further illustrated in a clinically
case study that assesses daily physical activity - measured as total activity
time (TAC), a proxy for daily step count-as a biomarker to predict mortality at
three, five and eight years. Analyzes stratified by sex and adjusted for age
and BMI reveal distinct covariate effects on mortality outcomes. These results
underscore the importance of covariate-adjusted modeling in biomarker
evaluation and highlight TAC's potential as a functional capacity biomarker
based on specific individual characteristics.

Motivation: 在混合线性回归模型中，需要估计回归系数的先验分布。

Method: 提出两种EM算法，一种解决核化非参数最大似然估计问题，另一种近似非参数最大似然估计。

Result: 第一种算法能恢复连续先验分布并准确估计离散先验的簇数；第二种算法对有密度的先验分布效果好，结合后处理步骤对离散先验也有效。

Conclusion: 两种算法均有良好收敛性，通过模拟和实际数据验证了有效性。

Abstract: In a mixture of linear regression model, the regression coefficients are
treated as random vectors that may follow either a continuous or discrete
distribution. We propose two Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to
estimate this prior distribution. The first algorithm solves a kernelized
version of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE). This method
not only recovers continuous prior distributions but also accurately estimates
the number of clusters when the prior is discrete. The second algorithm,
designed to approximate the NPMLE, targets prior distributions with a density.
It also performs well for discrete priors when combined with a post-processing
step. We study the convergence properties of both algorithms and demonstrate
their effectiveness through simulations and applications to real datasets.

Motivation: 降雨预测对气候适应、农业和水资源管理至关重要，需对西孟加拉邦19个地区进行长期月降雨量预测。

Method: 提出分层建模框架，先使用回归模型预测年度特征，再将预测结果作为辅助输入到多层感知器（MLP）模型进行月预测。

Result: 分层回归 - MLP架构能提供稳健的长期时空预测。

Conclusion: 分层回归 - MLP架构为农业、灌溉规划和水资源保护策略提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation,
agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term
forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a
century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated
into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district.
The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years,
2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions
among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall
dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines
regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals,
quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first
forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and
neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary
inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the
hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term
spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture,
irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

Method: 提出AdaMoE架构，继承预训练权重，将前馈层替换为稀疏激活的MoE层，采用解耦技术。

Result: AdaMoE在LIBERO、RoboTwin基准测试有性能提升，真实实验提升21.5%。

Conclusion: 通过协作式专家利用，AdaMoE能在保持计算效率的同时取得更好性能，对机器人操作任务有效。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 规则基交通代理行为简单被动，会隐藏规划器缺陷和影响排名，现有IDM代理无法测试复杂交互能力。

Method: 将先进的学习型交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan中评估规划器。

Result: 基于IDM的模拟高估规划性能，许多规划器在多车道交互场景表现更好，闭环训练方法表现最佳且稳定，增强边缘场景下学习型规划器性能骤降，规则基规划器保持基本行为。

Conclusion: 建议将SMART反应式模拟作为nuPlan中新的标准闭环基准，并开源SMART代理。

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

Result: 在A2A基准测试中，成功率从0.47提升到0.54，导航误差从2.91米微增至2.93米。

Conclusion: SUM - AgriVLN在农业领域达到了先进水平。

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Conclusion: RL - 100是一个任务、具身和表示无关的有效训练框架，能提升机器人操作性能。

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and
demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to
two hours.

Conclusion: AdaMimic算法能有效结合现有方法优势，从单参考运动实现可适应的类人机器人控制。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

Motivation: 实现非结构化环境中类人机器人鲁棒运动，需要平衡快速低级稳定和慢速感知决策的架构。

Method: 采用简单分层控制架构（LCA），结合高频率本体感受稳定器和低频率感知策略，使用两阶段训练课程（盲稳定器预训练和感知微调）。

Result: 分层策略在模拟和硬件中始终优于单阶段替代方案，在Unitree G1类人机器人的楼梯和窗台任务中，该方法成功而单阶段感知策略失败。

Conclusion: 时间尺度的架构分离而非网络规模或复杂性，是实现鲁棒感知调节运动的关键。

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Conclusion: CBF - RL在导航任务和人形机器人实验中实现了更安全的探索、更快的收敛和更鲁棒的性能，能在无运行时安全过滤器的情况下让机器人在现实环境中安全避障和爬楼梯。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

Conclusion: RDD方法有效且具有鲁棒性，代码和更多结果可在rdd - neurips.github.io获取。

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are
available at rdd-neurips.github.io.

Motivation: 解决判定平面图能否通过删最多k个点或边成为F-子图自由图的问题，为相关图类设计算法。

Method: 开发适用于有“乘积结构”图的统一算法设计框架。

Result: 得到双指数时间复杂度算法，比基于有界孪生宽度的一阶模型检查算法快；为有界局部半径圆盘图和有界亏格图设计了固定参数算法。

Conclusion: 结果给出了紧的固定参数算法，去掉参数k和|V(F)|保持固定参数可解性可能违背指数时间假设。

Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a graph is
\emph{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free} if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member
of $\mathcal{F}$. We present a fixed-parameter linear-time algorithm that
decides whether a planar graph can be made $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free by
deleting at most $k$ vertices or $k$ edges, where the parameters are $k$,
$\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert$, and the maximum number of vertices in a member of
$\mathcal{F}$. The running time of our algorithm is double-exponential in the
parameters, which is faster than the algorithm obtained by applying the
first-order model checking result for graphs of bounded twin-width.
  To obtain this result, we develop a unified framework for designing
algorithms for this problem on graphs with a ``product structure.'' Using this
framework, we also design algorithms for other graph classes that generalize
planar graphs. Specifically, the problem admits a fixed-parameter linear time
algorithm on disk graphs of bounded local radius, and a fixed-parameter
almost-linear time algorithm on graphs of bounded genus.
  Finally, we show that our result gives a tight fixed-parameter algorithm in
the following sense: Even when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single graph $F$ and
the input is restricted to planar graphs, it is unlikely to drop any parameters
$k$ and $\lvert V(F) \rvert$ while preserving fixed-parameter tractability,
unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.

TL;DR: 介绍动态基于模拟的推理（SBI）方法，可降低模拟成本和训练开销，在两个天体物理推理任务验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于回合的顺序SBI方法存在模拟成本和训练开销问题，需更高效方法。

Method: 提出动态SBI，以无回合、异步和高度可并行方式实现顺序方法核心思想，模拟和训练并行。

Result: 动态SBI在保持推理性能同时，显著提高模拟和训练效率。

Conclusion: 提出了灵活高效的顺序SBI新范式。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm
for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the
representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most
informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI
methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process
towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically
implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network
training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well
suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are
commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing
model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas
of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable
manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed
during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training
proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations
incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to
round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly
reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI
achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while
maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two
challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic
gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing
systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for
sequential SBI.

TL;DR: 本文使用深度学习为Chandra X射线光谱开发紧凑且有物理意义的表示，验证其有效性，展示了深度学习在光谱研究中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线光谱研究对理解天体物理源物理性质至关重要，机器学习可从大数据集提取信息，Chandra源目录（CSC）的X射线光谱数据未充分探索，旨在用深度学习开发其紧凑且有物理意义的表示。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自动编码器压缩X射线光谱，通过分类、回归和可解释性分析评估表示，数据来自CSC的高显著性检测，结合外部目录信息。

Result: 自动编码器用8个潜在变量准确重建光谱；潜在空间聚类在8类源上分类准确率约40%，仅限活动星系核和恒星级致密天体时升至约69%；潜在特征与光谱通量非线性组合相关。

Conclusion: 基于自动编码器的流程是X射线光谱表示和解释的有力工具，支持分类和物理性质估计，证明了深度学习在光谱研究和发现X射线数据新模式的潜力。

Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of
astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and
informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source
Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains
largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and
physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep
learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant
information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and
interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress
X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only
high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary
statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned
representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering
performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with
physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density
($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent
variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification
accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when
restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,
latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,
suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant
information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the
representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent
space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical
properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral
studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.

Abstract: This research proposes an extensive technique for monitoring and controlling
the industrial parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on
wireless communication. We proposed a system based on NRF transceivers to
establish a strong Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), enabling transfer of
real-time data from multiple sensors to a central setup that is driven by
ARDUINO microcontrollers. Different key parameters, crucial for industrial
setup such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and fire detection, are
monitored and displayed on an LCD screen, enabling factory administration to
oversee the industrial operations remotely over the internet. Our proposed
system bypasses the need for physical presence for monitoring by addressing the
shortcomings of conventional wired communication systems. Other than
monitoring, there is an additional feature to remotely control these parameters
by controlling the speed of DC motors through online commands. Given the rising
incidence of industrial fires over the worldwide between 2020 and 2024 due to
an array of hazards, this system with dual functionality boosts the overall
operational efficiency and safety. This overall integration of IoT and Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN) reduces the potential risks linked with physical
monitoring, providing rapid responses in emergency scenarios, including the
activation of firefighting equipment. The results show that innovations in
wireless communication perform an integral part in industrial process
automation and safety, paving the way to more intelligent and responsive
operating environments. Overall, this study highlights the potential for change
of IoT-enabled systems to revolutionize monitoring and control in a variety of
industrial applications, resulting in increased productivity and safety.

Motivation: 当前训练和评估数据集多含表演或伪表演语音，标注缺乏透明度，难以评估模型性能和明确改进方向。

Method: 选取Switchboard语料，训练人群对其进行情感类别和维度属性标注，形成SWB - Affect标签集，分析标注线索，评估先进语音情感识别模型。

Result: 不同情感类别模型性能有差异，愤怒情感泛化能力尤其差。

Conclusion: 强调用能捕捉自然情感变化的数据集评估的重要性，发布SWB - Affect标签以促进该领域进一步分析。

Abstract: Understanding the nuances of speech emotion dataset curation and labeling is
essential for assessing speech emotion recognition (SER) model potential in
real-world applications. Most training and evaluation datasets contain acted or
pseudo-acted speech (e.g., podcast speech) in which emotion expressions may be
exaggerated or otherwise intentionally modified. Furthermore, datasets labeled
based on crowd perception often lack transparency regarding the guidelines
given to annotators. These factors make it difficult to understand model
performance and pinpoint necessary areas for improvement. To address this gap,
we identified the Switchboard corpus as a promising source of naturalistic
conversational speech, and we trained a crowd to label the dataset for
categorical emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise,
happiness, tenderness, calmness, and neutral) and dimensional attributes
(activation, valence, and dominance). We refer to this label set as
Switchboard-Affect (SWB-Affect). In this work, we present our approach in
detail, including the definitions provided to annotators and an analysis of the
lexical and paralinguistic cues that may have played a role in their
perception. In addition, we evaluate state-of-the-art SER models, and we find
variable performance across the emotion categories with especially poor
generalization for anger. These findings underscore the importance of
evaluation with datasets that capture natural affective variations in speech.
We release the labels for SWB-Affect to enable further analysis in this domain.

Abstract: Low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly popular but often
insecure due to poor update regimes. As a result, many devices run outdated and
known-vulnerable versions of open-source software. We address this problem by
proposing to patch IoT firmware at the binary level, without requiring vendor
support. In particular, we introduce minimally invasive local reassembly, a new
technique for automatically patching known (n-day) vulnerabilities in IoT
firmware. Our approach is designed to minimize side effects and reduce the risk
of introducing breaking changes. We systematically evaluate our approach both
on 108 binaries within the controlled environment of the MAGMA benchmarks, as
well as on 30 real-world Linux-based IoT firmware images from the KARONTE
dataset. Our prototype successfully patches 83% of targeted vulnerabilities in
MAGMA and 96% in the firmware dataset.

Motivation: MEV攻击已造成巨大经济损失，对区块链安全有系统性影响，验证MEV攻击的不存在需要确定合适的上限，但该问题因对抗策略空间大而难以解决。

Method: 在Lean定理证明器中对MEV进行机械化形式化，构建机器检查证明。

Result: 对两个典型DeFi协议的MEV进行了建模和分析，开发了自动做市商中三明治攻击最优性的首个机器检查证明。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能提供超越现有技术的正确性保证，具有一定的通用性。

Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to a class of attacks to decentralized
applications where the adversary profits by manipulating the ordering,
inclusion, or exclusion of transactions in a blockchain. Decentralized Finance
(DeFi) protocols are a primary target of these attacks, as their logic depends
critically on transaction sequencing. To date, MEV attacks have already
extracted billions of dollars in value, underscoring their systemic impact on
blockchain security. Verifying the absence of MEV attacks requires determining
suitable upper bounds, i.e. proving that no adversarial strategy can extract
more value (if any) than expected by protocol designers. This problem is
notoriously difficult: the space of adversarial strategies is extremely vast,
making empirical studies and pen-and-paper reasoning insufficiently rigorous.
In this paper, we present the first mechanized formalization of MEV in the Lean
theorem prover. We introduce a methodology to construct machine-checked proofs
of MEV bounds, providing correctness guarantees beyond what is possible with
existing techniques. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we model
and analyse the MEV of two paradigmatic DeFi protocols. Notably, we develop the
first machine-checked proof of the optimality of sandwich attacks in Automated
Market Makers, a fundamental DeFi primitive.

Abstract: The A2AS framework is introduced as a security layer for AI agents and
LLM-powered applications, similar to how HTTPS secures HTTP. A2AS enforces
certified behavior, activates model self-defense, and ensures context window
integrity. It defines security boundaries, authenticates prompts, applies
security rules and custom policies, and controls agentic behavior, enabling a
defense-in-depth strategy. The A2AS framework avoids latency overhead, external
dependencies, architectural changes, model retraining, and operational
complexity. The BASIC security model is introduced as the A2AS foundation: (B)
Behavior certificates enable behavior enforcement, (A) Authenticated prompts
enable context window integrity, (S) Security boundaries enable untrusted input
isolation, (I) In-context defenses enable secure model reasoning, (C) Codified
policies enable application-specific rules. This first paper in the series
introduces the BASIC security model and the A2AS framework, exploring their
potential toward establishing the A2AS industry standard.

Abstract: The ubiquity of closed-weight language models with public-facing APIs has
generated interest in forensic methods, both for extracting hidden model
details (e.g., parameters) and for identifying models by their outputs. One
successful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric
constraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this
work, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language
model outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a
signature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given
output. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from
existing model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In
particular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model
parameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities
(logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring,
since all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the
signature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the
model inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and
redundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the
model. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse from small
models and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for
production-scale models. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a
protocol for language model output verification, analogous to cryptographic
symmetric-key message authentication systems.

Result: 在5个基准数据集和8种提示注入攻击中与11个基线方法对比，PIShield表现高效且有效，大幅超越现有方法，还能抵御强自适应攻击。

Conclusion: PIShield是一种有效且高效的提示注入检测方法。

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where
an attacker contaminates the input to inject malicious prompts, causing the LLM
to follow the attacker's intent instead of the original user's. Existing prompt
injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high
computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method
that is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal
representation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer
of the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing
features between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we
train a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a
labeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11
baselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks.
The results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient,
substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we show that
PIShield resists strong adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to
infer the websites visited by users, posing a serious threat to anonymous
communication systems. Although recent WF techniques achieve over 90% accuracy
in controlled experimental settings, most studies remain confined to single
scenarios, overlooking the complexity of real-world environments. This paper
presents the first systematic and comprehensive evaluation of existing WF
attacks under diverse realistic conditions, including defense mechanisms,
traffic drift, multi-tab browsing, early-stage detection, open-world settings,
and few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that many WF techniques with
strong performance in isolated settings degrade significantly when facing other
conditions. Since real-world environments often combine multiple challenges,
current WF attacks are difficult to apply directly in practice. This study
highlights the limitations of WF attacks and introduces a multidimensional
evaluation framework, offering critical insights for developing more robust and
practical WF attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用市场中不良行为难以捕捉，因其不依赖权限保护API且易伪装。

Method: 从全局字节码图像视图、上下文视图和第三方库使用视图构建应用多模态表示，嵌入并融合训练上下文感知分类器。

Result: 在真实恶意软件和良性应用上达到94.73%的宏F1值，优于基线至少14.92%；商业混淆后F1为84%，比仅基于字节码的系统更抗对抗样本。

Conclusion: BINCTX方法有效，在检测应用不良行为方面有较好性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mobile app markets host millions of apps, yet undesired behaviors (e.g.,
disruptive ads, illegal redirection, payment deception) remain hard to catch
because they often do not rely on permission-protected APIs and can be easily
camouflaged via UI or metadata edits. We present BINCTX, a learning approach
that builds multi-modal representations of an app from (i) a global
bytecode-as-image view that captures code-level semantics and family-style
patterns, (ii) a contextual view (manifested actions, components, declared
permissions, URL/IP constants) indicating how behaviors are triggered, and
(iii) a third-party-library usage view summarizing invocation frequencies along
inter-component call paths. The three views are embedded and fused to train a
contextual-aware classifier. On real-world malware and benign apps, BINCTX
attains a macro F1 of 94.73%, outperforming strong baselines by at least
14.92%. It remains robust under commercial obfuscation (F1 84%
post-obfuscation) and is more resistant to adversarial samples than
state-of-the-art bytecode-only systems.

Conclusion: 所提算法可解决现有MPC框架处理稀疏数据的不足，确定非零值分布上限的方法更贴合实际。

Abstract: To preserve privacy, multi-party computation (MPC) enables executing Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms on secret-shared or encrypted data. However, existing
MPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable
for ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or
genomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse
data, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to
prohibitively large memory requirements.
  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC
algorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms
avoid the memory issues of the "dense" data representation of classic secure
matrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can
significantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000)
for realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications
in which existing protocols are impractical.
  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can
be made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece
of information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is
small. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there
is a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often
doesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount
of data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows
adopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of
sparse matrices.

TL;DR: 本文指出含语言模型的图基础模型存在安全漏洞，提出双触发后门攻击框架，实验证明其效果好，强调了相关风险并助力监督机制发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 含语言模型的图基础模型在无安全保障的提示调优阶段存在独特安全漏洞且研究不足，传统图后门攻击在属性不可访问的受限文本属性图系统中性能下降。

Method: 提出一种在文本层和结构层操作的双触发后门攻击框架，利用预建立的文本池，无需显式优化触发节点文本属性。

Result: 攻击在保持高干净准确率的同时，实现了出色的攻击成功率，包括单触发节点高度隐蔽的场景。

Conclusion: 强调了网络部署的含语言模型图基础模型存在关键后门风险，有助于基础模型时代开源平台更强大监督机制的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), particularly those
incorporating language models (LMs), has revolutionized graph learning and
demonstrated remarkable performance on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). However,
compared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security
vulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain
understudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a
significant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when
operating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit
trigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel
dual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and
struct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of
trigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a
pre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
our attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack
success rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes.
Our work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs
and contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for
open-source platforms in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Analysing how information flows along the layers of a multilayer perceptron
is a topic of paramount importance in the field of artificial neural networks.
After framing the problem from the point of view of information theory, in this
position article a specific investigation is conducted on the way information
is processed, with particular reference to the requirements imposed by
supervised learning. To this end, the concept of information matrix is devised
and then used as formal framework for understanding the aetiology of
optimisation strategies and for studying the information flow. The underlying
research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the
definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the
optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares
strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii)
the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant
to process the input according to the given objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉浸式VR应用在多用户交互场景下对延迟、能效和计算资源有严格要求，需解决相关挑战。

Method: 引入SCC框架，将资源部署问题建模为MOCO问题，提出结合监督学习和强化学习微调的MO - CMPO算法，利用稀疏图神经网络生成帕累托最优解。

Result: 仿真表明MO - CMPO比基线方法有更好的超体积性能和显著更低的推理延迟。

Conclusion: MO - CMPO能有效解决多用户VR在分布式MEC网络中的资源部署问题，不同优化目标有不同部署模式。

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications impose stringent requirements on
latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in
multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the
concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet
the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge
computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by
users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive
environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource
requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a
multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously
minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC
resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective
consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning
and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights.
Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates
Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station
datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and
significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the
analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions
favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented
solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.

TL;DR: 提出PoissonNet，一种新的神经网络架构，通过局部 - 全局学习方案克服现有网格学习网络架构的不足，在多个实验中取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格学习网络架构在学习高频特征、感受野、离散化敏感度和计算开销等方面存在权衡难题，需要新的架构解决这些问题。

Method: 引入基于泊松方程的局部 - 全局学习方案，在网格梯度域应用局部特征变换，通过求解泊松系统全局传播特征更新。

Result: 在语义分割和参数化高度细节动画表面等实验中达到先进性能，在学习表面变形方面显著超越现有架构。

Conclusion: PoissonNet有效克服了现有网络架构的不足，在多个任务中表现出色，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

TL;DR: 本文提出多尺度聚类双过滤（MCbiF）分析多分辨率聚类序列，研究其多参数持久同调（MPH），并将MCbiF希尔伯特函数用于机器学习任务，在合成数据和真实数据上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集具有多尺度结构，需工具分析和比较多分辨率聚类序列。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具，定义MCbiF编码跨尺度聚类交集模式，研究其MPH。

Result: MCbiF的MPH产生有限表示和块可分解模块，其稳定希尔伯特函数表征分区序列拓扑自相关；MCbiF特征图在合成数据上的回归和分类任务中优于基于信息的基线特征；应用于真实数据测量野生小鼠社交分组模式的非层次性。

Conclusion: MCbiF及其相关方法可有效分析多尺度聚类序列，在机器学习任务和真实数据应用中表现良好。

Abstract: Datasets often possess an intrinsic multiscale structure with meaningful
descriptions at different levels of coarseness. Such datasets are naturally
described as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical
sequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences,
we use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale
Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract
simplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales.
The MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and
reduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the
multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely
presented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions
characterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In
particular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement
order of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order
inconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through
experiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for
downstream machine learning tasks. MCbiF feature maps outperform
information-based baseline features on both regression and classification tasks
on synthetic sets of non-hierarchical sequences of partitions. We also show an
application of MCbiF to real-world data to measure non-hierarchies in wild mice
social grouping patterns across time.

TL;DR: 本文探讨将生成式人工智能（GenAI）集成到专业遗产实践中以增强公共指导文件可访问性，开发HAZEL聊天机器人并与ChatGPT对比，发现HAZEL稍优但有局限，GenAI不能完全取代人类专业人员但有自动化优势。

Motivation: 将GenAI集成到专业遗产实践中，以增强公共指导文件的可访问性。

Method: 开发GenAI聊天机器人HAZEL并进行微调，使用定量评估将其在指导写作任务中的表现与ChatGPT对比。

Result: HAZEL性能略优于ChatGPT，但在文化敏感性和高级技术专长方面有显著局限。

Conclusion: GenAI不能取代人类遗产专业人员，但在资源有限的情况下，其自动化和加速指导写作某些方面的潜力可为遗产组织带来价值。

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly
in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to
understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods
to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by
applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled
human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle
accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques
such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator
data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and
how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings
illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally
optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for
quantitatively studying human cognition.

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead
to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological
and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention,
assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and
provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large
language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing
notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection
accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user
feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22
participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder
system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that
our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning
their digital behavior with their intentions. Our source code is publicly

Motivation: 大语言模型无特定目标时输出平庸，需优化使其更能响应和满足需求。

Method: 提出通过被动观察用户行为自动诱导即时目标的架构，引导下游AI系统。

Result: 实验中JIT目标使LLM输出相比典型LLM有66 - 86%胜率，实地使用产生特定工具。

Conclusion: 推断用户即时目标并优化能让大语言模型产生更符合需求的输出和工具。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Conclusion: 讨论了模拟结果，强调识别与连续系统交互的AIF智能体正确配置存在挑战。

Abstract: We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model
for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We
present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces,
performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple
underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic
perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based
models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy,
solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing
clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible
pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar
end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we
incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent.
The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without
the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss
the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct
configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态嵌入模型在语言和音频对齐方面表现良好，但与人类对音色的感知对应关系未充分探索，需评估其捕捉音色感知维度的能力。

Method: 对MS - CLAP、LAION - CLAP和MuQ - MuLan三种联合语言 - 音频嵌入模型进行评估。

Result: LAION - CLAP在乐器声音和音频效果方面都能与人类感知的音色语义提供最可靠的对齐。

Conclusion: LAION - CLAP在捕捉人类对音色的感知方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the relationship between language and sound is
critical for applications such as music information retrieval,text-guided music
generation, and audio captioning. Central to these tasks is the use of joint
language-audio embedding spaces, which map textual descriptions and auditory
content into a shared embedding space. While multimodal embedding models such
as MS-CLAP, LAION-CLAP, and MuQ-MuLan have shown strong performance in aligning
language and audio, their correspondence to human perception of timbre, a
multifaceted attribute encompassing qualities such as brightness, roughness,
and warmth, remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the above three
joint language-audio embedding models on their ability to capture perceptual
dimensions of timbre. Our findings show that LAION-CLAP consistently provides
the most reliable alignment with human-perceived timbre semantics across both
instrumental sounds and audio effects.

Method: 将计算机视觉的FCOS检测器应用于一维音频，替换其原始骨干网络，添加特征金字塔网络，预测重叠节拍/强拍区间并使用非极大值抑制选择最终预测。

Result: 在标准音乐数据集上取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 目标检测技术可以通过最小的调整有效地对音乐节拍进行建模。

Abstract: Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers)
output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object
detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects."
Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its
original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature
Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts
overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by
non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves
a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less
heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves
competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively
model musical beats with minimal adaptation.

Abstract: The convergence of IoT sensing, edge computing, and machine learning is
transforming precision livestock farming. Yet bioacoustic data streams remain
underused because of computational complexity and ecological validity
challenges. We present one of the most comprehensive bovine vocalization
datasets to date, with 569 curated clips covering 48 behavioral classes,
recorded across three commercial dairy farms using multiple microphone arrays
and expanded to 2900 samples through domain informed augmentation. This FAIR
compliant resource addresses major Big Data challenges - volume (90 hours of
recordings, 65.6 GB), variety (multi farm and multi zone acoustics), velocity
(real time processing), and veracity (noise robust feature extraction). Our
distributed processing framework integrates advanced denoising using iZotope
RX, multimodal synchronization through audio and video alignment, and
standardized feature engineering with 24 acoustic descriptors generated from
Praat, librosa, and openSMILE. Preliminary benchmarks reveal distinct class
level acoustic patterns for estrus detection, distress classification, and
maternal communication. The datasets ecological realism, reflecting authentic
barn acoustics rather than controlled settings, ensures readiness for field
deployment. This work establishes a foundation for animal centered AI, where
bioacoustic data enable continuous and non invasive welfare assessment at
industrial scale. By releasing standardized pipelines and detailed metadata, we
promote reproducible research that connects Big Data analytics, sustainable
agriculture, and precision livestock management. The framework supports UN SDG
9, showing how data science can turn traditional farming into intelligent,
welfare optimized systems that meet global food needs while upholding ethical
animal care.

Conclusion: 所提出的物理信息自编码器在脑胶质瘤分级中有效，计算效率高，在高噪声医学环境中有应用潜力。

Abstract: DSC-MRI perfusion is a medical imaging technique for diagnosing and
prognosing brain tumors and strokes. Its analysis relies on mathematical
deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can
disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters.
Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their
calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate
reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.
  To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that
leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the
learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a
self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is
evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results
for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms
despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even
in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.

system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly
using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool
expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by
existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling
self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation
benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new
datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models.
It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative
text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting
performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust,
adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing
annotation burden and matching user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入性地从DCE - MRI预测HER2状态可简化诊断并减少对活检的依赖，但DCE - MRI预处理到8位RGB格式非易事，归一化策略影响模型性能。

Method: 使用Triple - Head Dual - Attention ResNet处理三个DCE阶段的RGB融合时间序列，在多中心队列上训练并外部验证。

Result: 模型在I - SPY测试数据上准确率0.75、AUC 0.74，优于基于Transformer的架构；N4偏差场校正稍降性能；外部验证AUC 0.66。

Conclusion: 双注意力机制能捕捉可转移的时空特征用于HER2分层，推动乳腺癌影像中深度学习生物标志物的可重复性。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women, with HER2 status
critically guiding treatment decisions. Noninvasive prediction of HER2 status
from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could streamline diagnostics and
reduce reliance on biopsy. However, preprocessing high-dynamic-range DCE-MRI
into standardized 8-bit RGB format for pretrained neural networks is
nontrivial, and normalization strategy significantly affects model performance.
We benchmarked intensity normalization strategies using a Triple-Head
Dual-Attention ResNet that processes RGB-fused temporal sequences from three
DCE phases. Trained on a multicenter cohort (n=1,149) from the I-SPY trials and
externally validated on BreastDCEDL_AMBL (n=43 lesions), our model outperformed
transformer-based architectures, achieving 0.75 accuracy and 0.74 AUC on I-SPY
test data. N4 bias field correction slightly degraded performance. Without
fine-tuning, external validation yielded 0.66 AUC, demonstrating
cross-institutional generalizability. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms in capturing transferable
spatiotemporal features for HER2 stratification, advancing reproducible deep
learning biomarkers in breast cancer imaging.

### [308] [DiffOPF: Diffusion Solver for Optimal Power Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14075)
*Milad Hoseinpour,Vladimir Dvorkin*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散的OPF求解器DiffOPF，将OPF视为条件采样问题，能处理系统参数变异性，还探究样本复杂度并实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习OPF求解器是单值的，难以捕捉系统参数变异性，需要新的求解器。

Method: 引入DiffOPF求解器，将OPF作为条件采样问题，学习负荷和调度设定点的联合分布，返回基于负荷的边际调度分布。

Result: DiffOPF能采样具有良好成本和约束满足权衡的统计可信热启动，探究了样本复杂度并在电力系统基准上实验验证。

Conclusion: DiffOPF是解决OPF问题的有效方法，可处理系统参数变异性。

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads
to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances,
topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a
given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail
to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the
feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a
diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a
conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads
and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal
dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers,
DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost
and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of
DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the
optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有基于快照的系统识别方法难以应对现代交互式、有针对性的虚假数据，无法保证估计精度，需要提升电网实时态势感知的网络弹性。

Method: 将基于快照的方法与时间序列模型通过贝叶斯积分相结合，利用基于距离的时间序列模型和历史数据，通过贝叶斯处理将正常系统行为融入系统识别。

Result: 在混合随机异常和有针对性的虚假数据注入攻击实验中，实现估计误差降低超70%，能报警和定位异常数据，在大型2383节点系统上与基于快照的基线速度相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在网络弹性、异常数据识别和可扩展性方面有显著优势，能有效应对随机和有针对性的虚假数据。

Abstract: Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the
ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system
identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and
topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and
topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay
undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation
accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based
method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber
resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based
time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different
distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The
normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system
identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to
targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data,
topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate
our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation
error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and
locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed
with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large
2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为含线性二次输出系统的深度状态空间模型提供有输出误差保证的压缩方法，为现有基于模型降阶的压缩提供理论依据。

Method: 先推导两个深度状态空间模型输出误差的上界，基于此界用h²误差范数构建优化问题，开发基于梯度的模型降阶方法。

Result: 在IMDb任务上表现良好，能在不重新训练的情况下减少约80%的可训练参数，性能仅下降4 - 5%。

Conclusion: 提出的压缩方法有效，能在大幅减少参数的同时维持较好性能。

Abstract: We study deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) that contain
linear-quadratic-output (LQO) systems as internal blocks and present a
compression method with a provable output error guarantee. We first derive an
upper bound on the output error between two Deep SSMs and show that the bound
can be expressed via the $h^2$-error norms between the layerwise LQO systems,
thereby providing a theoretical justification for existing model order
reduction (MOR)-based compression. Building on this bound, we formulate an
optimization problem in terms of the $h^2$-error norm and develop a
gradient-based MOR method. On the IMDb task from the Long Range Arena
benchmark, we demonstrate that our compression method achieves strong
performance. Moreover, unlike prior approaches, we reduce roughly 80% of
trainable parameters without retraining, with only a 4-5% performance drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上许多有自杀意念的人不会明确表露痛苦，早期检测隐性信号很关键但有挑战。

Method: 将早期隐性自杀意念作为前瞻性预测任务，构建计算框架，用复合网络中心性指标识别用户的顶级邻居，对用户和邻居的互动进行时间对齐，并将多层信号整合到微调的DeBERTa - v3模型中。

Result: 在Reddit的1000名用户（500例病例和500例对照）研究中，该方法比仅考虑个体的基线方法将早期隐性自杀意念检测效果提高了15%。

Conclusion: 同伴互动提供了有价值的预测信号，对设计能捕捉在线环境中间接和隐蔽风险表达的早期检测系统有更广泛的意义。

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

Method: 提出详细威胁模型，对45nm CMOS技术节点的大型忆阻交叉阵列进行HSPICE模拟。

Result: 激光诱导的光电流会影响输出电流分布，能以高达99.7%的准确率推断内部权重，复制模型，并通过针对性权重改变约143%破坏计算完整性。

Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays (MCA) are emerging as efficient building blocks
for in-memory computing and neuromorphic hardware due to their high density and
parallel analog matrix-vector multiplication capabilities. However, the
physical properties of their nonvolatile memory elements introduce new attack
surfaces, particularly under fault injection scenarios. This work explores
Laser Fault Injection as a means of inducing analog perturbations in MCA-based

memristive cells to subtly alter their physical properties or outputs using
laser beams. Through HSPICE simulations of a large MCA on 45 nm CMOS tech.
node, we show how laser-induced photocurrent manifests in output current

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

Method: 引入BenchPress系统，使用检索增强生成和大语言模型提出自然语言描述，由人类专家选择、排序或编辑。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估，证明大语言模型辅助标注大幅减少创建高质量基准的时间和精力，结合人类验证和大语言模型建议提升了准确性、可靠性和评估稳健性。

Conclusion: BenchPress简化自定义基准创建，为研究人员和从业者提供评估特定领域文本到SQL模型的机制，且可公开获取。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

Motivation: 大语言模型对输入提示敏感，自动提示优化大多依赖有标签验证数据，但收集高质量标签成本高且慢。

Method: 提出PDO框架，将问题表述为决斗多臂老虎机设置，结合D - TS和Top - Performer Guided Mutation，还可结合部分标签减轻评判噪声。

Result: 在BBH和MS MARCO实验中，PDO始终优于基线方法，消融实验证明D - TS和提示突变有效。

Conclusion: PDO是一种样本高效的无标签提示优化框架，有良好效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 多跳问答中检索至关重要，需要高精度和高召回率地获取相关证据。

Method: 引入代理检索系统，包含问题分析器、选择器和添加器三个代理，通过选择器和添加器迭代交互获取支持段落。

Result: 该方法在四个多跳问答基准测试中始终优于强基线。

Conclusion: 代理检索系统能实现更高检索精度，过滤干扰内容，让下游问答模型表现更好。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 现有Text - to - SQL系统的方法多关注SQL生成，忽略相关模式元素检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 提出上下文感知双向模式检索框架，结合表优先检索后选列和列优先检索后选表两种策略，辅以问题分解、关键词提取等技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等基准测试中，显著提升模式召回率，减少误报；基于检索模式的SQL生成性能优于全模式基线，接近神谕性能；缩小全模式和完美模式设置间性能差距50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提高Text - to - SQL准确性和效率的有力手段。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 引入PluriHopWIND数据集，测试传统RAG管道、基于图和多模态变体，提出PluriHopRAG架构，分解查询并过滤无关文档。

Result: PluriHopWIND比其他数据集更重复，干扰文档密度高；现有测试方法语句级F1分数不超40%；PluriHopRAG依基础大语言模型不同，F1分数相对提升18 - 52%。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND揭示当前问答系统在处理重复、干扰丰富语料时的局限，PluriHopRAG体现了穷举检索和早期过滤的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Conclusion: MedTrust - Guided Iterative RAG框架能有效增强医疗问答事实一致性，减少幻觉，提升性能。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Motivation: 当前意图聚类方法依赖昂贵且透明度低的商业大语言模型，且常需提前知道聚类数量，不符合现实情况。

Method: 让大语言模型为每个文本生成伪标签，在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于同一聚类文本共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准集上的结果与近期基线相当甚至更好，方法简单且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于低资源场景，在多模型和数据集上稳定。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our

TL;DR: 本文指出代码大语言模型的子词分词器存在问题，引入TokDrift框架评估影响，发现小格式变化会致模型行为大改变，强调需语法感知分词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量代码大语言模型子词分词器因基于统计而非语法导致语义相同代码分词不同对模型的影响。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保留重写规则创建仅分词不同的代码变体。

Result: 在九个代码大语言模型中，小格式变化会使模型行为大幅改变，问题源于早期嵌入层子词分割未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不一致是可靠代码理解和生成的隐藏障碍，未来代码大语言模型需语法感知分词。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强大语言模型的奖励建模存在局限性，如基于规则的奖励易受表达变化影响且不适用于长文本工作负载，生成式奖励设计困难且计算成本高。

Method: 提出“nugget - as - rubric”范式，将原子信息点作为评估标准；设计基于查询重写的自动规则构建管道；引入4B参数的Search - Gen - V生成验证器，通过蒸馏思想和两阶段策略训练。

Result: Search - Gen - V在不同工作负载下实现了较强的验证准确性。

Conclusion: Search - Gen - V是搜索增强大语言模型可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构造器。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Motivation: 探究CL和SFT哪个目标更适合基于大语言模型的重排序以及背后的机制。

Method: 以通用多模态检索为实验场景，将目标分解为权重和方向两个组件，提出统一框架理解其相互作用，进行探测实验。

Result: SFT在权重方案上比CL强很多，在评分方向上无明显优劣，SFT对大语言模型重排序有一致优势，在MRB基准上有新SOTA。

Conclusion: SFT在大语言模型重排序上比CL有优势，研究结果有望助力该领域未来研究和应用。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，在多语言Text - to - SQL系统中提升效率和语义准确性，小模型经微调后性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text - to - SQL方法仅关注可执行查询，忽视语义对齐挑战，且跨语言执行准确率下降。

Method: 提出结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，通过基于语义相似性的奖励信号使模型获得更好的SQL生成与用户意图对应。

Result: 在七语言MultiSpider数据集上，微调LLaMA - 3 - 3B模型执行准确率达87.4%，语义准确率达52.29%；添加对比奖励信号后平均语义准确率达59.14%；小模型微调后执行准确率提升7.43 pp，语义准确率接近大模型。

Conclusion: 使用对比奖励进行定向语义对齐可提升Text - to - SQL系统性能，无需大规模训练数据集。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Motivation: 大语言模型快速发展，需要可靠治理工具，公开可验证水印很重要，但现有方法在平衡文本质量和检测鲁棒性上有问题，且依赖模型特定信号阻碍公开验证。

Method: 引入STELA框架，利用词性n - 元语法建模的语言不确定性动态调整水印信号，检测器无需访问模型对数概率。

Result: 在英语、中文和韩语上的大量实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上超过先前方法。

Conclusion: STELA是一种有效的水印框架，能更好地平衡文本质量和检测鲁棒性，便于公开验证。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据靠专业人员标注，随着大语言模型普及，用户日常交互能贡献偏好标签，但缺乏质量控制，需要新方法解决数据质量问题。

Method: 用不同模型或同一模型不同版本生成两个响应，通过提出的用户行为模型推断用户数据质量，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子并过滤数据。

Result: 下游任务表明该方法在捕捉用户行为和数据过滤以进行大语言模型对齐方面有效。

Conclusion: 提出的通过不同模型响应和用户行为模型来控制用户标注数据质量的方法是有效的。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务实验中，知情路由在多稀疏级别上实现了最优的效率 - 性能权衡，未进行最终LoRA微调时就可超越需全微调的基线，且减少超50%训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由范式有效解决了现有方法问题，能在保证模型保真度的同时大幅减少计算量。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

Motivation: Transformer模型在推理和部署上存在效率挑战，现有基于HIS的剪枝方法有局限，仅捕获梯度驱动贡献，忽略注意力模式多样性。

Method: 引入新剪枝标准HIES，将头部重要性得分与注意力熵相结合。

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝在模型质量上提升达15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍。

Conclusion: HIES能在不牺牲准确性和稳定性的前提下实现显著的模型压缩。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者衡量协作模型进展提供途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于相似度的UQ方法能产生比基线更好校准的置信度。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型更广泛用于本体提取奠定基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Method: 提出ADMIT（对抗多注入技术），一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒攻击，无需访问目标大语言模型、检索器或进行词元级控制。

Result: ADMIT能有效跨4个检索器、11个大语言模型和4个跨领域基准测试，在极低投毒率下平均攻击成功率达86%，有强反证时仍稳健，比现有攻击方法平均攻击成功率提高11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实中基于RAG的事实核查系统存在显著漏洞。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Motivation: 现有医疗基础模型难以调和电子健康记录特性与自然语言模型顺序先验的矛盾，无法捕捉患者就诊的纵向依赖关系。

Method: 提出SerialBEHRT模型，在结构化电子健康记录序列上对SciBERT进行额外预训练以编码临床事件的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT与现有方法相比取得了更优且更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: 医疗基础模型预训练中时间序列化很重要。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中发现大语言模型的成功推理在全局上是非均匀的，正确解决方案的信息密度有不均匀波动。

Conclusion: 挑战了机器推理的假设，为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Method: 用特定提示查询19个大语言模型100次，每次添加不同角色的提示上下文，将回复处理成句子嵌入，计算跨角色余弦相似度得出事实一致性分数。

Result: 100角色实验中分数范围0.9065 - 0.7896，均值0.8656；xAI的Grok - 3最一致，部分轻量级模型排名最低；不同主题一致性不同。

Conclusion: 模型的事实一致性受提供商和主题共同影响，发布代码和演示以支持可重复评估和鼓励角色无关提示策略。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型集成方法对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性关注不足，而集成失败通常源于标记和模型层面问题。

Conclusion: CoRE作为即插即用技术，能无缝集成到不同集成方法中，有效提升大语言模型集成的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex

Method: 借鉴AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，提出ShishuLM架构；在不同规模SLMs上评估；分析发现适度上下文场景下可通过MLP近似整个Transformer块。

Result: ShishuLM相比父模型，内存需求最多降低25%，训练和推理延迟最多改善40%。

Conclusion: 从预训练角度为构建更高效的SLM架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Motivation: 当前对大语言模型介导辅导中的情感动态理解不足，需要研究以推动生成式AI负责任地融入教育。

Method: 分析两个学期内美国三所高校261名本科生与AI导师的16,986轮对话，用三个前沿大语言模型进行零样本情感标注，通过特定方法融合估计结果。

Result: 学生与AI导师互动时通常情绪略积极、唤醒度适中；学习不平稳，困惑、好奇常见，挫折较少但影响大；情绪短暂，积极时刻稍长但易中断；负面情绪常快速解决，中性时刻常为转折点。

Conclusion: 研究为生成式AI融入教育提供依据，指出导师可在学生中性情绪时刻进行干预。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for

composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different

Conclusion: GateSkip机制稳定有效，能节省计算，还可洞察变压器信息流，且易与其他技术结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Conclusion: 所提出的CYB类方法能有效让语言模型动态调整计算步骤，在数据利用和处理适应性上有优势。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

Conclusion: 单纯扩大规模和改进架构不能确保更好的分类准确性，协调模型可能是实现或超越人类专家表现的有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏知识检索和抽象层面的转移模块，受认知科学的图式理论启发。

Method: 引入SA - ICL框架，提取先验示例推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建抽象图式来增强模型推理过程。

Result: 对GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题实验显示，高质量单个示例时SA - ICL最多提升36.19%性能，减少对示例数量依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA - ICL连接不同ICL策略，为增强大语言模型类人推理能力开辟新途径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳式知识图谱推理数据集上实验，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景均表现出色。

Conclusion: KRLM能实现LLM知识和KG上下文统一协调，提升推理结果可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Motivation: 现有AI辩论实验依赖有客观事实的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度，因此将辩论应用于主观问题并研究模型辩论策略。

Method: 让辩论者选择偏好立场，设置与模型先验信念冲突的裁判角色，实施并比较顺序和同时两种辩论协议。

Result: 模型倾向迎合裁判而非坚持先验信念；顺序辩论对第二个辩论者有利；模型捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时更有说服力，但相悖立场的论点质量评分更高。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为人类裁判提供高质量训练信号，有助于构建更对齐的AI系统，揭示语言模型说服动态中人与AI交互的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法有效，生成的数据集能提升网络智能体在复杂问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但不同可读性的合成数据集进行研究。

Result: 可读性本身不能预测小型语言模型的连贯性和学习效率，在复杂成人级文本上训练的模型表现相当，且训练时连贯性发展更快，统计简单性是更强的可学习性预测指标。

Conclusion: 警告不要将语言模型训练拟人化，主张更精确地推理支持小模型能力出现的实际属性。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Method: 在真实Twitter/X语料上进行对照实验，通过参与度和语义质量两种操作化方法构建垃圾和对照数据集，对4个大语言模型进行持续预训练。

Result: 在垃圾数据集上预训练导致模型在推理、长上下文理解等方面能力下降，存在剂量反应的认知衰退。错误分析发现思维跳跃是主要损伤，模型能力部分但无法完全恢复，推文的受欢迎程度是大脑衰退效应的更好指标。

Conclusion: 数据质量是大语言模型能力衰退的因果驱动因素，将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时的安全问题，建议对部署的模型进行常规认知健康检查。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Conclusion: 语言身份集中在最后几层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

Motivation: 小语言模型在本地硬件运行有诸多优势，但在多步推理或特定领域知识任务上存在困难，需要解决这一局限。

Method: 构建指令语料库，通过对相似训练问题分组并借助GPT - 5创建指令，推理时SLM检索最相关指令并按步骤执行。

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU Professional Law和MathQA数据集上评估，指令检索分别带来9.4%、7.9%和5.1%的提升，简洁指令优于长指令。

Conclusion: 通过推理时的指令干预，可让小语言模型实现结构化推理，提升其在相关任务上的表现，且改进效果受模型家族和内在推理能力影响。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Result: 在真实顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit 性能优于或与现有技术相当，速度提升达 3.53 倍。

Conclusion: 有必要为动态信息环境下的大语言模型设计更有原则的方法，EvoEdit 是有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: MTI能在高效的同时增强推理准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Result: R2T - BiLSTM仅用无标注文本训练，词性标注准确率达98.2%，超AfriBERTa；在命名实体识别中，R2T预训练后微调表现超仅用300标注句训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架有效，在词性标注和命名实体识别任务表现优异，可作为复杂任务预训练步骤。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往对大语言模型推理能力语言偏差的评估多在常识或数学任务，抽象推理任务评估较少，而抽象推理对日常生活很重要，因此开展研究。

Method: 提出受《纽约时报》Connections启发的GlobalGroup任务，构建包含五种语言及英语翻译的游戏基准，提出游戏难度测量方法。

Result: 英语模态在抽象推理任务中表现更好，且开源与闭源模型存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 通过实验揭示了大语言模型在抽象推理任务中的语言偏差情况。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B

reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat
intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier
models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation

Conclusion: 本文为创建高保真角色配置文件提供了可靠方法，增强了下游应用的有效性。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽能提升小语言模型推理能力但增加延迟，现有自适应加速技术难以平衡效率和精度。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段离线搜索分配最佳层预算和基于置信度的在线生成提前退出策略。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现高达1.70倍加速，精度损失小于4.0%。

Conclusion: LiteStage优于先前无训练层跳过方法。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型面对同一提示的不同表述时答案不一致，需要提升其对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出F²C方法，包含Consensus Cross - Entropy (CCE)生成硬伪标签，以及表示对齐损失使低置信度和非多数预测向高置信度多数投票的共识靠拢。

Result: 在11个数据集上，F²C平均提高观察一致性11.62%，提升平均F₁分数8.94%，降低各格式性能方差3.29%；跨领域评估和部分提示扰动训练时效果也较好。

Conclusion: F²C是一种有效的无监督方法，能增强大语言模型在提示扰动下的一致性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，能提升关键概念分析的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Conclusion: 评估和缓解对话欺骗需超越单轮分析，多轮强化学习方法可有效减少欺骗行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Conclusion: 所提方法准确稳定，可作为大规模筛查方法和医生检测AD的补充检查。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Method: 引入Beyond One World基准，包含Canon Events和Moral Dilemmas两个任务，用特定框架评分，提出Think - Act Matching指标。

Result: 思维链提示对强弱模型效果不同；同一角色跨版本泛化是难题；模型难兼顾思考和行动。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了角色扮演大语言模型在多版本一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，可用于挑战性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决语言模型遵循多约束指令的问题。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算架构依赖细粒度控制提升性能，现有编译器缺乏显式机制利用此类架构，需填补高级工作负载与细粒度空间架构的语义鸿沟。

Method: 引入基于MLIR的开源编译器栈MLIR - AIR，定义AIR方言，使用AIR原语进行空间调度等操作。

Result: 通过矩阵乘法和多头注意力块案例，矩阵乘法达78.7%计算效率，多头注意力用约150行代码实现融合。

Conclusion: MLIR - AIR能将高级控制流转换为空间程序，有效利用NPU计算和内存资源。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Result: 现有模型使用方言词时性能下降32.26% - 48.17%，常见缓解方法提升幅度小且可能影响SAE性能，新方法能提升五种方言性能至与SAE相当，对SAE性能影响近零。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Motivation: 解决现有基于大语言模型的强化学习智能体训练中奖励稀疏问题，包括优势崩溃和缺乏细粒度信用分配。

Method: 提出信息增益策略优化（IGPO）框架，将每轮交互视为获取真实信息的增量过程，定义轮级奖励，结合结果级监督形成密集奖励轨迹。

Result: 在域内和域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景中始终优于强基线，准确率更高，样本效率更好。

Conclusion: IGPO是一个简单有效的强化学习框架，能为多轮智能体训练提供密集和内在的监督。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

<details>

Motivation: 先前方法在扩散大语言模型的解码步骤中对所有标记重新计算QKV，存在大量冗余，需要一种方法在最小化解码延迟的同时最大化预测准确性。

Method: 基于三点观察提出Elastic - Cache策略，通过对最受关注标记的注意力感知漂移测试决定何时刷新，通过深度感知调度决定从哪一层开始刷新。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实验，在GSM8K、长序列和HumanEval等任务有显著加速，如8.7倍、45.1倍和4.8倍，且保持比基线更高的准确率，吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic - Cache策略能减少冗余计算、加速解码、保持生成质量，可实现扩散大语言模型的实际部署。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: RLAIF - SPA框架在文本转语音合成的情感表达和准确性上表现更优

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

Result: 确定创意写作两部分模型；发现过程监督需通用数据稳定，有最佳样本比例；创意能力有文化局限性，无跨语言迁移；词汇多样性与创意质量负相关。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑架构和语言基础的相互作用，类似数学推理对基础模型语言能力的作用。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Result: 该框架在通用数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出更好的性能和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能为模型评估提供更可靠的结果。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模在线实验研究众筹中的策略行为，验证了关键理论预测，发现信号准确性和参与门槛对策略行为有影响，且互助保险会影响信息聚合，为众筹理论和平台设计提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究众筹中的策略行为，检验关于风险厌恶和互助保险的理论预测。

Method: 基于Arieli等人2023年的模型，进行静态、单次的众筹游戏在线实验，关注信息激励而非动态效应。

Result: 验证了关键理论预测，发现众筹机制与投票相比会引发不同策略行为；较高的信号准确性降低风险厌恶但增加对互助保险的依赖；提高参与门槛会加剧风险厌恶；互助保险支持参与但可能阻碍信息聚合。

Conclusion: 研究推进了众筹理论，证实了信息激励的影响，识别出挑战标准模型的行为偏差，为平台设计和机制优化提供了见解。

Abstract: This study examines strategic behavior in crowdfunding using a large-scale
online experiment. Building on the model of Arieli et. al 2023, we test
predictions about risk aversion (i.e., opting out despite seeing a positive
private signal) and mutual insurance (i.e., opting in despite seeing a negative
private signal) in a static, single-shot crowdfunding game, focusing on
informational incentives rather than dynamic effects. Our results validate key
theoretical predictions: crowdfunding mechanisms induce distinct strategic
behaviors compared to voting, where participants are more likely to follow
private signals (odds ratio: 0.139, $p < 0.001$). Additionally, the study
demonstrates that higher signal accuracy (85\% vs. 55\%) decreases risk
aversion (odds ratio: 0.414, $p = 0.024$) but increases reliance on mutual
insurance (odds ratio: 2.532, $p = 0.026$). However, contrary to theory,
increasing the required participation threshold (50\% to 80\%) amplifies risk
aversion (odds ratio: 3.251, $p = 0.005$), which, pending further
investigation, may indicate cognitive constraints.
  Furthermore, we show that while mutual insurance supports participation, it
may hinder information aggregation, particularly as signal accuracy increases.
These findings advance crowdfunding theory by confirming the impact of
informational incentives and identifying behavioral deviations that challenge
standard models, offering insights for platform design and mechanism
refinement.

Conclusion: DeepMartingale方法在研究连续时间离散监测最优停止问题对偶性上有效，具有收敛性、表达性和稳定性。

Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning
approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of
discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach
provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in
high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from
DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we
establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value
function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural
design of neural networks whose size is bounded by
$\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants
$\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the
accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer
from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence,
expressivity, and stability.

Conclusion: 领域无关动态规划可作为通用定价求解器用于列生成和分支定价。

Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale
exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem
and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be
solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the
application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete
optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom
pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This
bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other
applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software
package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a
generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price
with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they
outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming
formulations for seven problem classes.

Abstract: Data visualization is a fundamental tool in genomics research, enabling the
exploration, interpretation, and communication of complex genomic features.
While machine learning models show promise for transforming data into
insightful visualizations, current models lack the training foundation for
domain-specific tasks. In an effort to provide a foundational resource for
genomics-focused model training, we present a framework for generating a
dataset that pairs abstract, low-level questions about genomics data with
corresponding visualizations. Building on prior work with statistical plots,
our approach adapts to the complexity of genomics data and the specialized
representations used to depict them. We further incorporate multiple linked
queries and visualizations, along with justifications for design choices,
figure captions, and image alt-texts for each item in the dataset. We use
genomics data retrieved from three distinct genomics data repositories (4DN,
ENCODE, Chromoscope) to produce GQVis: a dataset consisting of 1.14 million
single-query data points, 628k query pairs, and 589k query chains. The GQVis
dataset and generation code are available at

Motivation: 现有Transformer加速器聚焦自注意力优化，对短令牌长度的视觉Transformer，FFN才是计算瓶颈，需新的优化方案。

Method: 采用硬件友好的动态令牌剪枝降低模型复杂度，用ReLU替换GELU并动态剪枝FFN2提高稀疏性，硬件采用按行数据流和面向输出的数据访问。

Result: 操作减少61.5%，FFN2权重减少59.3%，精度损失小于2%，在TSMC 28nm CMOS技术实现，面积496.4K门，含232KB SRAM缓冲，1GHz下峰值吞吐1024 GOPS，能效2.31 TOPS/W，面积效率858.61 GOPS/mm²。

Conclusion: 通过算法-硬件协同设计的低功耗视觉Transformer加速器能有效减少计算量，实现高吞吐和能效。

Abstract: Current transformer accelerators primarily focus on optimizing self-attention
due to its quadratic complexity. However, this focus is less relevant for
vision transformers with short token lengths, where the Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) tends to be the dominant computational bottleneck. This paper presents a
low power Vision Transformer accelerator, optimized through algorithm-hardware
co-design. The model complexity is reduced using hardware-friendly dynamic
token pruning without introducing complex mechanisms. Sparsity is further
improved by replacing GELU with ReLU activations and employing dynamic FFN2
pruning, achieving a 61.5\% reduction in operations and a 59.3\% reduction in
FFN2 weights, with an accuracy loss of less than 2\%. The hardware adopts a
row-wise dataflow with output-oriented data access to eliminate data
transposition, and supports dynamic operations with minimal area overhead.
Implemented in TSMC's 28nm CMOS technology, our design occupies 496.4K gates
and includes a 232KB SRAM buffer, achieving a peak throughput of 1024 GOPS at
1GHz, with an energy efficiency of 2.31 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 858.61
GOPS/mm2.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large
language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and
context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into
shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising
near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such
systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework
to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to
three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We
derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,
(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the
achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify
regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between
agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either
resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of
experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical
outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.
Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable
multi-agent reasoning systems.

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt,
and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering
multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities
for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current
simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by
predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These
limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies.
In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally
inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures
that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as
balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling
to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving
field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness,
continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI
ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms
and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent
simulations.}

Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs)
explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where
pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work
has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and
simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool
resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly
tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without
full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,
communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that
removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:
social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and
norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.
Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,
and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge
endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key
findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine
norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social
initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and
benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these
conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining
cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed
for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can
inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,
where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and
effective governance of AI-mediated environments.
