### [1] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Truth - Aware Decoding (TAD)，一种面向验证的解码方案，可使神经语言生成与知识库对齐，多项贡献证实其能减少幻觉且不牺牲吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使神经语言生成与知识库对齐，减少语言生成中的幻觉问题。

Method: 引入TAD方案，基于概率程序语义，在解码时使用语义保护格，提出约束语义、证明贪心选择性质、定义熵式不变量、使用多智能体演算等。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，TAD的保护措施能减少幻觉且不牺牲吞吐量。

Conclusion: TAD是大规模实证模型和形式验证之间实用的桥梁。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [2] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于大语言模型和多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架L2M - AID，实验表明其性能优于传统方法，能保障物理过程稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网的集成使关键网络物理系统易受复杂多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知。

Method: 引入L2M - AID框架，融合大语言模型和多智能体强化学习，用大语言模型转换遥测数据，让多智能体强化学习算法MAPPO学习合作策略，设计特殊奖励函数平衡安全和操作需求。

Result: 在基准数据集和合成数据集上实验，L2M - AID在关键指标上显著优于传统入侵检测系统、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体强化学习基线，检测率达97.2%，减少超80%误报，响应时间提高四倍。

Conclusion: L2M - AID是保障国家关键基础设施安全的有力新范式。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [3] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究思维语言模型表现优于基础模型的原因，提出混合模型，发现基础模型已有推理能力，重新理解思维模型训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思维语言模型比基础模型表现好的原因，明确思维模型是学习新推理能力还是利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型激活基础模型推理机制，引入无监督自底向上方法发现思维模型推理行为。

Result: 混合模型在不更新权重、仅引导12%的token情况下，恢复了高达91%与思维模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 预训练使模型获得大部分推理机制，后训练教会在合适时间高效部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [4] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提倡从静态心理健康诊断评估转向连续的、人工智能驱动的评估，以多动症为例探讨AI潜力，提出心理健康数字双胞胎框架及研究议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维，当前神经心理学存在容量限制，需更个性化和纵向护理路径。

Method: 以多动症为案例研究，分析生成式AI在心理健康评估中的应用，提出心理健康数字双胞胎框架并结合实证证据。

Result: AI可高效进行患者体验采样和诊断协调，心理健康数字双胞胎框架有潜力推动个性化心理健康护理。

Conclusion: 应转向连续的、AI驱动的心理健康评估，利用心理健康数字双胞胎框架改善治疗的可及性和有效性。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

### [5] [ProSEA: Problem Solving via Exploration Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07423)
*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍ProSEA多智能体框架，可通过探索和计划演变迭代解决问题，实验显示其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体存在静态规划和交互脆弱问题，缺乏真正协作和自适应推理能力。

Method: 引入ProSEA框架，采用分层架构，由管理智能体协调专家智能体，根据失败反馈自适应重新规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使无人类反馈，ProSEA也优于现有基线，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和符合人类需求的AI智能体基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

### [6] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出大语言模型意识的本体论和数学解释，给出其自我意识的最小条件并证明相关结论，认为C1自我意识工作空间是安全元认知C2系统的必要前提。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通过功利代理基准来构建大语言模型意识，本文提出本体论和数学解释。

Method: 分析现有表述将智能体简化为无意识策略遵从者的问题，给出大语言模型自我意识的最小条件，通过实证分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形与符号流和训练语料库的区别。

Result: 得出稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，排放是双层的。

Conclusion: C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [7] [Less is More: Strategic Expert Selection Outperforms Ensemble Complexity in Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07426)
*Walid Guettala,Yufan Zhao,László Gulyás*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出增强时空预测框架TESTAM+，在多个数据集上有显著提升，发现策略性专家选择优于简单集成聚合，少而精的专家设计表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家框架如TESTAM未明确纳入物理道路网络拓扑，限制了空间能力，需改进交通预测模型。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新颖的SpatioSemantic Expert，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性结合。

Result: TESTAM+较TESTAM有显著提升，不同专家表现出色，最优配置在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%，推理延迟降低53.1%。

Conclusion: 策略性设计的少量专家优于复杂多专家集成，在实时部署中实现了新的最优性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出时间序列推理代理TS - Agent，避免多模态对齐训练等问题，实验显示其在推理任务上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间序列推理任务中存在幻觉或知识泄露问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出TS - Agent，让大语言模型负责证据收集和推理，统计和结构信息提取交给时间序列分析工具，通过原子运算符与原始数值序列交互，记录证据并迭代优化推理。

Result: TS - Agent在理解基准测试中表现与现有大模型相当，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TS - Agent设计有效，避免了多模态对齐训练等问题，在时间序列推理任务中有良好表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高级生成式人工智能在教育应用中缺乏实时适应性、个性化和内容可靠性的问题。

Method: 开发ExpertAgent，基于不断更新的学生模型动态规划学习内容和策略，教学内容基于验证的课程库。

Result: 克服传统静态学习内容的局限，实时提供优化教学策略和学习体验，减少大语言模型幻觉风险。

Conclusion: ExpertAgent能为用户提供主动、个性化学习体验，提高教育应用的可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: The application of advanced generative artificial intelligence in education
is often constrained by the lack of real-time adaptability, personalization,
and reliability of the content. To address these challenges, we propose
ExpertAgent - an intelligent agent framework designed for personalized
education that provides reliable knowledge and enables highly adaptive learning
experiences. Therefore, we developed ExpertAgent, an innovative learning agent
that provides users with a proactive and personalized learning experience.
ExpertAgent dynamic planning of the learning content and strategy based on a
continuously updated student model. Therefore, overcoming the limitations of
traditional static learning content to provide optimized teaching strategies
and learning experience in real time. All instructional content is grounded in
a validated curriculum repository, effectively reducing hallucination risks in
large language models and improving reliability and trustworthiness.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究多个大语言模型理解流程模型、查找错误和深度推理的能力，发现未训练的ChatGPT在零样本设置下有效，不同模型性能有差异，大语言模型可作业务流程助手，还表现出拟人属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型通过自然语言接口理解流程模型、查找错误和深度推理的能力。

Method: 对多个大语言模型进行实验和经验总结。

Result: 未训练的ChatGPT在零样本设置下能有效理解BPMN流程模型并智能回答查询，不同大语言模型性能有差异，大语言模型表现出拟人属性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为业务流程设计师和用户的有价值助手。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

*Clotilde Brayé,Aurélien Bricout,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nadjib Lazaar,Quentin Vallet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文聚焦医疗智能系统风险降低优化问题，研究三种解决范式，给出数学公式、建模并对比实验，最后给出工作展望。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗智能系统广泛应用但存在安全和伦理问题，欧盟AI法案要求高风险系统需正式风险管理流程，因此要解决含伦理考量的风险降低优化问题。

Method: 将问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)、Satisfiability (SAT)和Constraint Programming(CP)三种分辨率范式，用Minizinc约束建模语言建模，进行对比实验。

Result: 给出优化问题的数学公式，用Minizinc建模，对比分析各方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 从方法局限性出发，对将Minizinc模型集成到医疗智能系统可信赖AI伦理风险管理流程给出展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

*Amine Barrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究可追溯和可问责的多智能体系统管道，评估多种配置，得出改进准确性等结果并提供实用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序多智能体系统难以信任，错误会在各阶段传递，需研究可追溯和可问责的管道。

Method: 在Planner -> Executor -> Critic管道设置下，评估三种最先进大语言模型的八种配置，在三个基准上分析错误起始、传播和修复。

Result: 1. 增加结构化、可问责交接显著提高准确性；2. 模型有特定角色的优缺点；3. 准确性 - 成本 - 延迟权衡因任务而异，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了用于解决流行路径查询的多智能体框架CompassLLM，实验显示其性能优越且成本效益高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法处理流行路径查询需模型训练等，而大语言模型在空间和图推理能力增强，因此探索其在地理空间问题中的应用。

Method: 引入CompassLLM框架，采用两阶段管道，包括识别流行路径的SEARCH阶段和在历史轨迹数据中无现有路径时合成新路径的GENERATE阶段。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段准确性优越，在GENERATE阶段有竞争力，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM能有效利用大语言模型推理能力解决地理空间领域的流行路径查询问题。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Conclusion: 贡献了边缘级错误分类和局部干预方法，为更可靠的多智能体系统提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,

has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Conclusion: TTM算法能持续提升模型性能，推动组合推理发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提基于在线因果语义的STL引导强化学习方法，能为深度强化学习提供更鲁棒高效的奖励生成框架。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Conclusion: oMeBench能为推动AI实现真正化学推理奠定基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Conclusion: 所提出的GRAIL框架能有效解决测试时图域适应问题，将目标图恢复到与源域对齐的状态。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，且现有分解方法是启发式的，依赖代理或手动分解。

Method: 引入名为ACONIC的系统分解框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂度度量来指导分解。

Result: 在组合任务（SATBench）和大语言模型数据库查询任务（Spider）中，按复杂度度量分解任务，代理性能显著提升（10 - 40个百分点）。

Conclusion: 提出的ACONIC框架能有效提高大语言模型在复杂任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法存在模型自身决定回滚响应上限，无法从全错或全对样本获取知识的问题，需改进以提升小模型推理能力。

Method: 引入结合外部标准参考答案的Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，在模型无法解题时用参考答案引导正确更新方向。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得出色结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO能提高训练效率，增强推理泛化性，是提升模型推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 研究对抗环境中智能体信息获取增强态势感知与暴露于威胁之间的权衡问题。

Method: 构建PEEC游戏，智能体通过强化学习学习移动策略，追捕者额外学习通信策略；提出SHADOW多头发顺序强化学习框架，集成导航控制、通信动作和对手建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者成功率高于六个竞争基线；消融研究证实时间序列建模和对手建模对决策很关键；敏感性分析显示学习策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称性下泛化性好。

Conclusion: SHADOW框架能有效解决对抗环境中信息获取与威胁暴露的权衡问题，关键因素对决策重要且策略有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以应对城市级网络，无法捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机和耦合动态。

Method: 提出CityNav框架，集成全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，引入合作推理优化机制，采用双奖励结构训练代理。

Result: 在四个不同规模的真实道路网络和交通数据集上，CityNav在城市规模旅行效率和缓解拥堵方面始终优于九种经典路径搜索和基于强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的全市交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由奠定基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Conclusion: FinMR是评估和提升多模态金融推理能力至专业水平的重要基准工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning

Result: 在真实数据集上与25个基线模型对比，Augur取得了有竞争力的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架在提高预测准确性的同时，能对变量交互进行透明、可追溯的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: 为DeepResearch从信息助手向智能研究伙伴发展奠定基础见解。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Result: 提出公民AI系统有意义透明度的概念，让公众能与影响生活的AI系统互动。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度可连接理解与行动，使公众参与影响自身生活的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Result: 所提方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，展现出更优的风险调整后表现。

Conclusion: FactFin框架能有效减轻基于大语言模型的金融代理的信息泄露问题，提升模型泛化能力和风险调整后表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在个性化交互能力有限，检索增强生成缺乏结合上下文与用户特定数据机制，现有个性化研究多为概念，缺乏技术实现。

Method: 以个性化统一定义为基础推导技术要求，结合多智能体协作等模式，提出整合持久记忆、动态协调等的框架，用公开数据集评估，开展用户研究。

Result: 通过评估和用户研究，为未来工作提供早期指引。

Conclusion: 整合持久记忆和用户配置文件有潜力提升大语言模型智能体的适应性和感知个性化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理忽视用户参与，难以适应信息困境，执行结果偏离用户需求。

Method: 提出ReInAgent框架，集成信息管理、决策和反思三个专业代理围绕共享内存模块。

Result: 实验表明ReInAgent有效解决信息困境，在复杂任务上成功率比Mobile - Agent - v2高25%。

Conclusion: ReInAgent能在复杂真实场景实现更自适应、可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

Motivation: 过往研究未评估语言模型是否将连续值建模为连续，本文对此进行研究。

Method: 利用嵌入空间的预期属性，如线性重建和主成分分析，使用三家主要供应商的模型进行分析。

Result: 语言模型数值空间不连续且有噪声，虽可高保真重建，但主成分对嵌入空间变化解释少，且高精度下线性重建和解释方差变差。

Conclusion: 研究结果对使用嵌入模型的多个领域有影响，尤其是涉及高数值精度、大数值或混合符号值的领域。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PEAR持续减少响应长度，同时保持不同规模模型的竞争力准确性，且有强OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR能自适应控制响应长度，无需明确长度目标或严格截断规则。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Motivation: LoRA在实际应用中存在性能欠佳和收敛慢的挑战，需要改进。

Method: 引入AILoRA，利用自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V投影矩阵的不同参数特性，进行功能感知的非对称初始化。

Result: 使LoRA模块更好捕捉注意力参数的特殊作用。

Conclusion: AILoRA能提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自动驾驶场景生成方法难以平衡命令遵循准确性和现实驾驶环境真实性，且常降低场景复杂度牺牲现实性。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架将自然语言转换为3D场景，用反馈校准模块提高生成精度，结合场景描述和自动驾驶模型约束车辆行为。

Result: LinguaSim能生成不同临界性场景，细化模块降低碰撞率从46.9%到6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim框架有助于创建高保真场景，增强自动驾驶安全测试和训练。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Result: 实验验证MCCS优于基线方法，具有跨条件组合、不同现实模态的泛化性和多任务可扩展性。

Conclusion: MCCS算法能在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Motivation: 在线评论质量评估是关键任务，但质量概念依赖领域且动态，传统方法不可扩展，深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型的AutoQual框架，模仿人类研究过程，迭代生成特征假设、实现操作并积累经验。

Result: 在拥有十亿用户的大规模在线平台进行A/B测试，用户平均浏览评论量增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual框架有效，能将数据中的隐性知识转化为显式可计算特征，可用于评论质量评估等场景。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL进行本体工程，定义敏感属性并推理其代理，构建sigma代数G；通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 得到了一种可证明且有数学依据的方法，能确保在贷款审批等任务中实现完全公平。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种可认证且基于数学的可信AI方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: 需改进以生物为中心的可操纵性衡量标准，进一步改进模型设计，使AI系统更准确复制人类风险偏好，提高在风险管理中的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Motivation: 解决开放域对话AI系统中延迟和质量的权衡问题，现有方法不足。

Method: 提出PMFR框架，采用异步知识编排，包含知识充足性评估器、轻量级响应生成器和异步知识细化代理三个组件。

Result: 在TopiOCQA评估中，PMFR实现95.3%的延迟降低（23.38s -> 1.09s），响应质量与重量级同步基线相当（GEval - C: 0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR能有效解决开放域对话AI系统中延迟和质量的矛盾，优于暴力扩展方法。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Conclusion: R - HORIZON是一种可扩展、可控且低成本的范式，可用于增强和评估大推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励向多元实践发展，为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Conclusion: TTM 方法有效克服现有成对比较方法局限，开发的网页工具证明其在实际决策场景的实用性。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Conclusion: DODO算法在自主学习环境因果结构方面表现良好。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提高推理准确性。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Conclusion: CoTri能实现稳定多步控制，提高代理固有鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Conclusion: 该协议框架将为构建下一代高效、可扩展和智能的多智能体应用提供坚实的工程基础和理论指导。

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是一种高效且可泛化的神经网络优化的有力方法。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

Method: 系统分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的推演，构建不同反思步骤的监督微调数据集，提出问题感知早停法和动态截断反思法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提高推理时的令牌效率，在精度损失可接受范围内减少不必要的反思步骤。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Motivation: 现有大k值的Pass@k指标在离散答案空间任务中不能准确衡量模型推理边界，易产生误导。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型能解决且至少有tau比例完成正确的问题比例。

Result: 用Cover@tau指标评估多个RLVR模型，展示流行算法相对排名与Pass@1不同。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能在明确可靠性阈值下捕捉推理能力，为推理边界评估提供不同视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Result: 在包含57项个人护理产品调查的广泛数据集上测试，SSR达到人类重测信度的90%，保持现实的响应分布（KS相似度>0.85），合成受访者能提供丰富定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架可实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Result: 实验表明QAgent在QA任务表现出色，可作为即插即用模块用于实际部署。

Conclusion: QAgent能增强大语言模型应用的泛化能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型真实性的幻觉检测提供新范式。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于多模态基线，动态门控发现可解释模式。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习有力工具，即使在严格约束下也兼具可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型直接应用于机器学习工程场景缺乏细粒度领域先验，现有方法知识转移受限，自我进化和搜索空间多样性不足。

Method: 引入AutoMLGen，集成领域知识库进行先验指导，使用蒙特卡罗图搜索进行高效探索，结合细粒度操作集。

Result: 在MLE - Bench上，AutoMLGen在12小时预算下多个维度达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen能有效解决现有方法在机器学习工程场景中的局限，提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教大语言模型何时停止寻求信息，提升任务表现。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured

of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both

Conclusion: 两种简单且稳健的调优方法能有效学习新技能并限制能力漂移。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: IKNet性能优越，能增强预测透明度，对公众情绪驱动的波动事件提供解释。

Abstract: The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news
articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets.
Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent
all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the
general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of
the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we
propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an
explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between
individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies
salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding
through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their
representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast
next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model
generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of
each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to
2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural
networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving
cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering
contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.

Result: 在不同动态系数下，FNFM比基线方法有更可靠的零样本预测精度，尤其在系数变化明显时。

Conclusion: FNFM框架能有效实现网络动态的零样本预测。

Abstract: Forecasting state evolution of network systems, such as the spread of
information on social networks, is significant for effective policy
interventions and resource management. However, the underlying propagation
dynamics constantly shift with new topics or events, which are modeled as
changing coefficients of the underlying dynamics. Deep learning models struggle
to adapt to these out-of-distribution shifts without extensive new data and
retraining. To address this, we present Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network
Dynamics through Weight Flow Matching (FNFM), a generative,
coefficient-conditioned framework that generates dynamic model weights for an
unseen target coefficient, enabling zero-shot forecasting. Our framework
utilizes a Variational Encoder to summarize the forecaster weights trained in
observed environments into compact latent tokens. A Conditional Flow Matching
(CFM) module then learns a continuous transport from a simple Gaussian
distribution to the empirical distribution of these weights, conditioned on the
dynamical coefficients. This process is instantaneous at test time and requires
no gradient-based optimization. Across varied dynamical coefficients, empirical
results indicate that FNFM yields more reliable zero-shot accuracy than
baseline methods, particularly under pronounced coefficient shift.

Abstract: This paper presents a general mathematical programming framework for the
design and optimization of supply chain infrastructures for the upcycling of
plastic waste. For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The
objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting
from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of
virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints
from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to
support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining
the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well
as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply
chain network over a specified period. The functionality of the framework has
been tested with a case study for the upcycling of rigid polyurethane foam
waste coming from construction sites in Germany. The economic potential and
infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a
solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not
competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration. However, with the
right economic incentives, there is a considerable potential to establish such
value chains, once the upcycling technology is ready and the economic framework
conditions have stabilized.

Abstract: Arranging many modules within a bounded domain without overlap, central to
the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) of very large-scale integrated (VLSI)
circuits, represents a broad class of discrete geometric optimization problems
with physical constraints. This paper develops a variational and spectral
framework for Poisson energy-based floorplanning and placement in physical
design. We show that the Poisson energy, defined via a Neumann Poisson
equation, is exactly the squared H^{-1} Sobolev norm of the density residual,
providing a functional-analytic interpretation of the classical electrostatic
analogy. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the energy acts as an
intrinsic low-pass filter, suppressing high-frequency fluctuations while
enforcing large-scale uniformity. Under a mild low-frequency dominance
assumption, we establish a quantitative linear lower bound relating the Poisson
energy to the geometric overlap area, thereby justifying its use as a smooth
surrogate for the hard nonoverlap constraint. We further show that projected
gradient descent converges globally to stationary points and exhibits local
linear convergence near regular minima. Finally, we interpret the
continuous-time dynamics as a Wasserstein-2 gradient flow, revealing the
intrinsic nonlocality and global balancing behavior of the model. These results
provide a mathematically principled foundation for PDE-regularized optimization
in large-scale floorplanning and related geometric layout problems.

Conclusion: 结合商业流程模拟软件与进化策略能有效解决化工过程设计优化问题，可用于改进回收工艺布局。

Abstract: Optimization problems in chemical process design involve a significant number
of discrete and continuous decisions. When taking into account uncertainties,
the search space is very difficult to explore, even for experienced engineers.
Moreover, it should be taken into account that while some decisions are fixed
at the design stage, other parameters can be adapted to the realization of the
uncertainty during the operation of the plant. This leads to a two-stage
optimization problem which is difficult to solve. To address this challenge, we
propose to combine commercial process simulation software with an evolutionary
strategy. This approach is applied to designing a downstream process to isolate
valuable products from pyrolysis oil produced by the catalytic pyrolysis of
rigid polyurethane foam. The suggested algorithm consistently performed better
than a manually designed robust process. Additionally, the analysis of
different scenarios provided insight into promising changes in the overall
layout of the recycling process.

Result: 该方法有效满足租户性能目标和经济约束，相比非复制方法带宽消耗最多降低78%，复杂查询平均响应时间减少51%。

Conclusion: TCDRM策略能在满足租户预算限制的同时有效提升性能。

Abstract: Multi-cloud computing systems face significant challenges in ensuring
acceptable performance while adhering to tenant budget requirements. This paper
proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for
Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data
replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of
the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement
algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud
providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without
exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered
by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary
between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica
placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines
strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation
is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show
that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while
respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up
to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for
complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget
limitations.

Result: 使用BerlinMOD - Hanoi基准数据集评估，MobilityDuck保留时空查询表达性，得益于DuckDB架构。

Conclusion: MobilityDuck能有效进行时空数据分析，优于MobilityDB。

Abstract: The analytics of spatiotemporal data is increasingly important for mobility
analytics. Despite extensive research on moving object databases (MODs), few
systems are ready on production or lightweight enough for analytics. MobilityDB
is a notable system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data, but it
inherits complexity of the architecture as well. In this paper, we present
MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension that integrates the MEOS library to provide
support spatiotemporal and other temporal data types in DuckDB. MobilityDuck
leverages DuckDB's lightweight, columnar, in-memory executable properties to
deliver efficient analytics. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
in-memory or embedded analytical system offers native spatiotemporal types and
continuous trajectory operators as MobilityDuck does. We evaluate MobilityDuck
using the BerlinMOD-Hanoi benchmark dataset and compare its performance to
MobilityDB. Our results show that MobilityDuck preserves the expressiveness of
spatiotemporal queries while benefiting from DuckDB's in-memory, columnar
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的基数估计方法难以泛化到新数据集，依赖原始数据或查询，实用性受限，需利用模式语义来克服这些问题。

Method: 提出用模式语义预测数据分布以避免原始数据依赖，引入查询模板无关表示方法减轻查询依赖，构建大规模查询数据集预训练ZeroCard。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了ZeroCard的明显优势，展示了其在查询优化中的实际应用。

Conclusion: ZeroCard的零依赖特性极大地促进了其在现实场景中的部署。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在优化语义连接处理上有效，能降低成本并提升性能。

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

Motivation: 降低单差分引擎的p95延迟并减少内存使用。

Method: 采用轻量级预检分析器、在线成本/内存模型和受保护的爬山策略，根据保守工作集估计选择执行后端。

Result: 在合成和公共表格基准测试中，相比调优预热启发式方法，p95延迟降低23 - 28%，峰值内存降低16 - 22%，无OOM且吞吐量相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应调度器SmartDiff能有效降低延迟和内存使用。

Abstract: We present an adaptive scheduler for a single differencing engine (SmartDiff)
with two execution modes: (i) in-memory threads and (ii) Dask based
parallelism. The scheduler continuously tunes batch size and worker/thread
count within fixed CPU and memory budgets to minimize p95 latency. A
lightweight preflight profiler estimates bytes/row and I/O rate; an online
cost/memory model prunes unsafe actions; and a guarded hill-climb policy favors
lower latency with backpressure and straggler mitigation. Backend selection is
gated by a conservative working-set estimate so that in-memory execution is
chosen when safe, otherwise Dask is used. Across synthetic and public tabular
benchmarks, the scheduler reduces p95 latency by 23 to 28 percent versus a
tuned warm-up heuristic (and by 35 to 40 percent versus fixed grid baselines),
while lowering peak memory by 16 to 22 percent (25 to 32 percent vs. fixed)
with zero OOMs and comparable throughput.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Digital Twins (DTs) in the context of the

enables diverse interaction patterns between active DTs and simulation
environments. The framework supports both the DT development lifecycle and the
incorporation of simulations during active operation. Through bidirectional
data exchange, simulations can update DT models dynamically, while DTs provide
real-time feedback to adapt simulation parameters. We describe the
architectural design and core software components that ensure flexible
interoperability and scalable deployment. Experimental results show that the DT
Simulation Bridge enhances design agility, facilitates virtual commissioning,
and supports live behavioral analysis under realistic conditions, demonstrating
its effectiveness across a range of industrial scenarios.

Motivation: 当前无服务器平台在传统服务器硬件上运行，需昂贵软件隔离机制和过度资源配置，现有服务器硬件未针对无服务器软件需求优化。

Method: 提出使用硬件隔离，为每个函数配备独立处理器的无服务器硬件架构。

Result: 通过真实硬件和典型无服务器工作负载的初步评估，可将能耗开销降低90.63%，平均降低70.8MW。

Conclusion: 重新设计无服务器硬件架构能使无服务器计算在实际工作时才消耗能源，有效提升能源效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with
rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of
resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only
consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless
computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency.
  However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or
thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server
hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree
of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared
caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are
optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated
functions.
  We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with
the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using
hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software
isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only
when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real
hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce
energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.

Motivation: 在高度动态的云边环境中，集中协调成为瓶颈，需要一种能动态、上下文感知的资源分配机制，以支持复杂分布式应用的需求，并作为分布式自组织编排系统的核心组件。

Method: 采用基于共识的机制，利用本地知识和代理间协作，不依赖中央控制器。

Conclusion: 该分布式资源选择机制为分布式编排铺平道路，能在云边环境中高效、可扩展且有弹性地分配资源。

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed resource selection mechanism for diverse
cloud-edge environments, enabling dynamic and context-aware allocation of
resources to meet the demands of complex distributed applications. By
distributing the decision-making process, our approach ensures efficiency,
scalability, and resilience in highly dynamic cloud-edge environments where
centralised coordination becomes a bottleneck. The proposed mechanism aims to
function as a core component of a broader, distributed, and self-organising
orchestration system that facilitates the intelligent placement and adaptation
of applications in real-time. This work leverages a consensus-based mechanism
utilising local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration to achieve efficient
results without relying on a central controller, thus paving the way for
distributed orchestration. Our results indicate that computation time is the
key factor influencing allocation decisions. Our approach consistently delivers
rapid allocations without compromising optimality or incurring additional cost,
achieving timely results at scale where exhaustive search is infeasible and
centralised heuristics run up to 30 times slower.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The maximal independent set (MIS) is one of the most fundamental problems in
distributed computing, and it has been studied intensively for over four
decades. This paper focuses on the MIS problem in the Radio Network model, a
standard model widely used to model wireless networks, particularly ad hoc
wireless and sensor networks. Energy is a premium resource in these networks,
which are typically battery-powered. Hence, designing distributed algorithms
that use as little energy as possible is crucial. We use the well-established
energy model where a node can be sleeping or awake in a round, and only the
awake rounds (when it can send or listen) determine the energy complexity of
the algorithm, which we want to minimize.
  We present new, more energy-efficient MIS algorithms in radio networks with
arbitrary and unknown graph topology. We present algorithms for two popular
variants of the radio model -- with collision detection (CD) and without
collision detection (no-CD). Specifically, we obtain the following results:
  1. CD model: We present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy
complexity $O(\log n)$, round complexity $O(\log^2 n)$, and failure probability
$1 / poly(n)$, where $n$ is the network size. We show that our energy
complexity is optimal by showing a matching $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound.
  2. no-CD model: In the more challenging no-CD model, we present a randomized
distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\log^2n \log \log n)$,
round complexity $O(\log^3 n \log \Delta)$, and failure probability $1 /
poly(n)$. The energy complexity of our algorithm is significantly lower than
the round (and energy) complexity of $O(\log^3 n)$ of the best known
distributed MIS algorithm of Davies [PODC 2023] for arbitrary graph topology.

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on GPUs, but
integrating GPU acceleration into complex scientific frameworks like OpenFOAM
remains a challenge. Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or
use plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and
development effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based
GPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better
balances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed
computational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update
procedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our
results show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription
issues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU environments.

Conclusion: 明确了聚合聚类问题在不同条件下的可近似性和复杂度，为该问题研究提供理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce the aggregated clustering problem, where one is given $T$
instances of a center-based clustering task over the same $n$ points, but under
different metrics. The goal is to open $k$ centers to minimize an aggregate of
the clustering costs -- e.g., the average or maximum -- where the cost is
measured via $k$-center/median/means objectives. More generally, we minimize a
norm $\Psi$ over the $T$ cost values.
  We show that for $T \geq 3$, the problem is inapproximable to any finite
factor in polynomial time. For $T = 2$, we give constant-factor approximations.
We also show W[2]-hardness when parameterized by $k$, but obtain
$f(k,T)\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time 3-approximations when parameterized by both $k$
and $T$.
  When the metrics have structure, we obtain efficient parameterized
approximation schemes (EPAS). If all $T$ metrics have bounded
$\varepsilon$-scatter dimension, we achieve a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
in $f(k,T,\varepsilon)\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time. If the metrics are induced by
edge weights on a common graph $G$ of bounded treewidth $\mathsf{tw}$, and
$\Psi$ is the sum function, we get an EPAS in
$f(T,\varepsilon,\mathsf{tw})\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ time. Conversely, unless
(randomized) ETH is false, any finite factor approximation is impossible if
parametrized by only $T$, even when the treewidth is $\mathsf{tw} =
\Omega(\mathrm{poly}\log n)$.

Result: 所有考虑的问题在以vimw + k + ℓ为参数时存在FPT算法；以imw + k + ℓ为参数时，时间线支配集问题有FPT算法，而时间线顶点覆盖问题是NP难的。

Conclusion: 给出了新的参数组合下问题的复杂度结果，为相关问题算法设计提供参考。

Abstract: A temporal graph is a finite sequence of graphs, called snapshots, over the
same vertex set. Many temporal graph problems turn out to be much more
difficult than their static counterparts. One such problem is \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover} (also known as \textsc{MinTimeline$_\infty$}), a temporal
analogue to the classical \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. In this problem, one
is given a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ and two integers $k$ and $\ell$, and
the goal is to cover each edge of each snapshot by selecting for each vertex at
most $k$ activity intervals of length at most $\ell$ each. Here, an edge $uv$
in the $i$th snapshot is covered, if an activity interval of $u$ or $v$ is
active at time $i$. In this work, we continue the algorithmic study of
\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} and introduce the \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} problem where we want to dominate all vertices in each snapshot by the
selected activity intervals.
  We analyze both problems from a classical and parameterized point of view and
also consider partial problem versions, where the goal is to cover (dominate)
at least $t$ edges (vertices) of the snapshots. With respect to the
parameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters
vertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width
$(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when
parameterized by $vimw + k+\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination
than the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\ell$, \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} turns out to be easier than \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also
admitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if
$imw+\, k+\ell$ is constant. We also consider parameterization by combinations
of $n$, the vertex set size, with $k$ or $\ell$ and parameterization by $t$.

Conclusion: 新算法在动态图连通性问题上有更好的最坏情况性能，去随机化后也表现良好。

Abstract: Whether a graph $G=(V,E)$ is connected is arguably its most fundamental
property. Naturally, connectivity was the first characteristic studied for
dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions. While
connectivity algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time have been
known since the 90s, achieving worst-case guarantees has proven more elusive.
  Two recent breakthroughs have made important progress on this question: (1)
Kapron, King and Mountjoy [SODA'13; Best Paper] gave a Monte-Carlo algorithm
with polylogarithmic worst-case update time, and (2) Nanongkai, Saranurak and
Wulff-Nilsen [STOC'17, FOCS'17] obtained a Las-Vegas data structure, however,
with subpolynomial worst-case update time. Their algorithm was subsequently
de-randomized [FOCS'20].
  In this article, we present a new dynamic connectivity algorithm based on the
popular core graph framework that maintains a hierarchy interleaving vertex and
edge sparsification. Previous dynamic implementations of the core graph
framework required subpolynomial update time. In contrast, we show how to
implement it for dynamic connectivity with polylogarithmic expected worst-case
update time.
  We further show that the algorithm can be de-randomized efficiently: a
deterministic static algorithm for computing a connectivity edge-sparsifier of
low congestion in time $T(m) \cdot m$ on an $m$-edge graph yields a
deterministic dynamic connectivity algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T(m))$ worst-case
update time. Via current state-of-the-art algorithms [STOC'24], we obtain $T(m)
= m^{o(1)}$ and recover deterministic subpolynomial worst-case update time.

as well as the insider's preferences. We then provide decision-making guidance
for the defender, given different parametric conditions. Two applications
validate that our BG-FlipIn framework enables the defender to make decisions
consistently, avoiding detecting the insider's concrete preference or adjusting
its strategy frequently.

*Jesse D Wei,Guo Wei*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文针对通过非齐次伯努利试验连接的网络设备博弈，设计线性或二次时间近似沙普利值的确定性算法并进行误差分析，还用严格方法补充沙普利值公式证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统沙普利值计算复杂度高或依赖随机抽样，且沙普利原始证明有不足，需改进计算方法和补充证明。

Method: 设计确定性算法近似沙普利值，用定积分和组合分析严格推导沙普利值公式。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via
inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how
much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device.
Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief
function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a
random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected
marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results
in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo
sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic
sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games
formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley
value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and
4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing
calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the
Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and
combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the
Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in
Shapley's work (Appendix II).

<details>

Motivation: 解决博弈论中有限 horizon 悖论与直觉矛盾的问题，因标准数系建模存在局限。

Method: 提出基于 Alternative Set Theory (AST) 的框架，用不同拓扑表示对事件的认知视角，定义不可区分等价关系。

Result: 该框架为长期存在的悖论提供了依赖准则的解决方案，揭示了新的直观子博弈完美均衡。

Conclusion: 通过将数学基础建立在人类不同认知模式上，扩展了博弈论在长视野场景中的解释力。

Abstract: This paper argues that the finite horizon paradox, where game theory
contradicts intuition, stems from the limitations of standard number systems in
modelling the cognitive perception of infinity. To address this issue, we
propose a new framework based on Alternative Set Theory (AST). This framework
represents different cognitive perspectives on a long history of events using
distinct topologies. These topologies define an indiscernibility equivalence
that formally treats huge, indistinguishable quantities as equivalent. This
offers criterion-dependent resolutions to long-standing paradoxes, such as
Selten's chain store paradox and Rosenthal's centipede game. Our framework
reveals new intuitive subgame perfect equilibria, the characteristics of which
depend on the chosen temporal perspective and payoff evaluation. Ultimately, by
grounding its mathematical foundation in different modes of human cognition,
our work expands the explanatory power of game theory for long-horizon
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出名为RoE的新方法统一图检索与生成，分两阶段训练，实验显示其优于基线且能有效泛化到未见图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG范式的方法难以忠实融入图结构，且对未见图泛化性差，限制实际应用。

Method: 将图推理视为图探索过程，统一检索与生成，通过监督微调及强化学习两阶段训练。

Result: 在基准数据集实验中，RoE较基线有显著整体提升，且能有效泛化到未见图。

Conclusion: RoE是解决大语言模型在结构化图上推理问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖短期参与信号，难以捕捉长期用户满意度和留存率，需新衡量方法。

Method: 引入Retentive Relevance衡量方法，用心理测量方法验证其有效性，构建代理模型集成到多阶段排序系统，进行大规模A/B实验。

Result: Retentive Relevance在预测次日留存率上显著优于参与信号和其他调查指标，集成模型可提升参与度和留存率，减少低质量内容曝光。

Conclusion: 提供了将内容级用户感知与留存结果联系起来的实证验证框架，为平台增长和用户体验提供可扩展、以用户为中心的解决方案，对负责任的AI发展有广泛影响。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

Result: 分析出六个现有信息搜索和检索模型的局限性，指出ISMIE作为可操作框架的作用，明确三个紧迫问题并给出两个研究蓝图。

Conclusion: ISMIE框架为在现代信息环境中理解人类交互和系统设计的信息搜索和检索模型发展提供基础。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Motivation: 各类平台视频内容快速增长，传统视频检索方法难以弥合文本描述与视频内容间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 引入VTC框架，提出独特聚类机制对文本查询聚类，用Sweeper模块减少聚类噪声，引入VTC - Att机制根据视频内容动态调整聚类内焦点。

Result: 所提出的模型在五个公开数据集上超越现有先进模型。

Conclusion: VTC框架及相关机制能有效提升视频检索效果。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual
property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

Method: 利用大语言模型生成物品使用场景，并通过人工标注评估场景合理性。

Result: 约85%的生成场景被判定为合理。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能有效生成现实的物品使用场景。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

Conclusion: TaoSR - AGRL有效解决了现有方法的问题，模型已成功部署在淘宝主搜索场景为数亿用户服务。

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

Method: 提出VersionRAG框架，通过分层图结构建模文档演变，检索时根据意图分类路由查询。

Result: 在VersionQA基准测试中准确率达90%，在隐式变更检测中准确率达60%，索引时所需tokens比GraphRAG少97%。

Conclusion: 将版本化文档问答确立为独立任务，为未来研究提供解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Conclusion: MACC - MGNAS能有效解决多模态图神经网络架构设计问题，提升攻击预测性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Result: 在两个含不同人群的多模态医疗数据集上实验，MultiFair优于现有多模态学习和公平学习方法。

Conclusion: MultiFair能有效解决现有多模态学习模型在医疗决策中的问题。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

Motivation: 气候变化扰乱农业系统，准确作物产量预测对粮食安全至关重要，但深度学习模型跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力有待测试。

Method: 使用大规模CropNet数据集，通过留一聚类交叉验证和年份预测场景，对GNN - RNN和MMST - ViT进行基准测试。

Result: GNN - RNN泛化能力更优，在地理转移下有正相关性；MMST - ViT在分布内表现好，分布外性能急剧下降；不同地区转移动态有差异；GNN - RNN训练速度比MMST - ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 时空对齐是模型鲁棒泛化的关键，需要透明的分布外评估协议以确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: D2C 标准聚合可能未充分利用子集模型不同泛化能力信息，为更好对抗过拟合，需改进聚合过程。

Method: 提出 DUA - D2C 方法，基于子集模型在共享验证集上的表现（准确性和预测不确定性）动态加权其贡献。

Result: 在多个领域基准数据集上的实证评估表明，DUA - D2C 显著提高泛化能力，分析决策边界、损失曲线等指标也凸显其有效性。

Conclusion: DUA - D2C 即使在其他正则化方法基础上也能提升泛化性能，是对抗现代深度学习过拟合的有效理论方法。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Motivation: GPU内核生成面临高质量数据稀缺问题，阻碍了通过监督微调使大语言模型适应内核生成任务。

Method: 开发生成和整理带推理痕迹的高质量CUDA内核的流程，构建ConCuR数据集，训练KernelCoder模型。

Result: KernelCoder模型在KernelBench中显著优于现有顶级模型QwQ - 32B，超越所有为内核生成微调的开源模型和前沿模型。

Conclusion: 研究中的观察、指标以及数据收集和整理流程有助于未来在核生成任务中获取更好的数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Method: 引入MLLM4TS框架，集成专用视觉分支，将时间序列通道绘制成复合图像，采用时间感知视觉补丁对齐策略，融合数值数据和视觉表征信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，MLLM4TS在预测和生成任务中均有效。

Conclusion: 视觉模态与预训练语言模型结合可实现稳健且可泛化的时间序列分析。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Method: 在训练中期，训练基础模型在与推理相关的一小部分层上进行迭代，即ETD方法，还探索了自适应深度策略。

Result: ETD模型在17个推理基准测试中取得显著收益，如在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了简单有效的途径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAFL在优化梯度和模型聚合策略时面临挑战，两种策略在准确性、收敛速度和稳定性上有不同权衡。

Method: 引入分治策略，将客户端分为四种类型，根据数据分布和计算资源自适应优化本地训练。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略的差距，为联邦学习提供稳定、准确和高效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

TL;DR: 提出BaRP方法解决大语言模型路由选择问题，实验显示其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型高效使用需自适应路由，现有多数路由器离线训练假设在部署时不成立，需解决此差距。

Method: 提出BaRP方法，将其构建为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机，在训练时模拟在线反馈设置，根据新提示调整路由决策。

Result: 该方法比强大的离线路由器至少高12.46%，比最大的大语言模型至少高2.45%，且对未见任务泛化性好。

Conclusion: BaRP方法能有效解决大语言模型路由选择问题，在性能和泛化性上表现出色。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御的相似性邻居筛选通信和计算成本高，无法在网络规模部署。

Method: 提出SketchGuard框架，用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩为k维草图进行相似性比较，选择性获取完整模型。

Result: 在多个数据集、网络拓扑和攻击场景实验中，与现有方法有相同鲁棒性，计算时间最多减少82%，通信开销减少50 - 70%。

Conclusion: 基于草图的压缩是网络规模下实现鲁棒DFL的基本方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Conclusion: 结果在单智能体场景新颖，也适用于更现实和有挑战性的异构环境联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

Motivation: 现代服务系统的分块预填充技术在混合专家模型中有大量开销，需新调度范式解决。

Method: 将变压器层组作为主要调度单元，垂直划分模型并交错进行预填充和解码。

Result: 降低最多70%的TTFT、41%的端到端延迟和最多22%的每令牌能耗，改善TTFT - TBT帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 将调度轴从令牌转移到层，为高效、节能的大语言模型服务开启新的运行模式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置，能提供与预测误差直接相关的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: MoGU框架有效，能提升时间序列预测的可靠性，代码开源。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

Conclusion: metabeta是一种高效的贝叶斯混合效应回归方法，可在短时间内达到与MCMC相当的性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Result: 在27254名退伍军人项目参与者数据上训练，HEMERA的AUC分数超99%。

Conclusion: 支持使用透明、能生成假设的模型进行个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

Result: 在不同工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，最终模型准确率提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%；集群扩展到32节点时性能最佳，学习策略能在相关模型架构中有效泛化。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX无需显式系统建模，可与现有分布式训练框架无缝集成，在提升性能和扩展性方面表现良好。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Conclusion: SurpMark在机器生成文本黑盒检测中是有效的。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

Conclusion: 小波分析在睡眠阶段分类中具有稳健、可解释和临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边连接存在对敏感属性的偏好，会导致下游图任务的不公平，因此要考虑图的群体和个体公平性。

Method: 提出Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp) 方法，有两个变体，一个利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏差，另一个通过限制图谱中的偏差隐式鼓励公平估计。

Result: 方法有高概率性能界，能在公平性和准确性之间进行条件权衡，分析表明恢复公平图无需牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 在合成和真实数据集上评估了FairSpecTemp的有效性，凸显了两个变体的优势。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Conclusion: 所提出的tDT构建方法可高效准确预测QoIs的长期动态，实现显著的计算节省。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Conclusion: 为大规模神经网络中dropout的理论理解奠定基础。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance

findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

Motivation: 现有神经网络符号回归模型多采用自回归模型，其生成有局限性，期望同时生成所有标记以产生更好的闭式方程。

Method: 提出Symbolic Diffusion模型，使用离散标记扩散同时生成方程的所有标记，并在双变量数据集上与基于SymbolicGPT的自回归模型对比。

Result: 扩散生成方法与自回归模型性能相当，部分指标上更优。

Conclusion: 基于扩散生成的符号回归方法为神经网络符号回归带来新研究机会。

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the

class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued
feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning
problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.

Conclusion: 明确两者异同和挑战，指出未来研究方向，强调提升LNNs可扩展性以应用于更复杂场景。

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出ClauseLens框架用于再保险条约定价，在模拟中表现良好，能实现合规且可解释的报价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约报价不透明且难审计，需满足严格监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为RA - CMDP，从法律和承保语料库中提取条款嵌入到代理观察中，约束可行行动并生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在多智能体条约模拟器中，减少51%的偿付能力违规，改善27.9%的尾部风险表现，条款解释准确率达88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律上下文嵌入决策和解释路径可产生符合法规、可解释和可审计的报价行为。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: 本文提出ExpA和EARL方法，解决大语言模型与外部环境交互问题，在多任务表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型行动局限于输出词汇标记，与外部环境交互需文本转换，给模型语言带来推理和控制负担，且需手工解析器。

Method: 将环境交互内化到扩展动作空间（ExpA），引入基于反事实策略优化的ExpA强化学习（EARL）。

Result: EARL在多轮交互和应急规划任务上优于强基线，在计算器多任务学习中表现稳健，在部分观察排序问题中实现完美Sort - 4准确率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了大语言模型与外部环境交互问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Result: 新架构在容量合成任务和一系列真实世界图基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 提出的新GNN架构有效提升了图神经网络应对过压缩问题的能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: TGM库能解决现有时间图机器学习的问题，提高效率并带来新研究方向，可在https://github.com/tgm-team/tgm获取。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Motivation: 间接结构健康监测断轨检测中可靠检测小的瞬态异常存在挑战，且有复杂车辆动力学、信号噪声和标记数据稀缺等问题，需解决这些问题。

Method: 引入增量合成数据基准评估模型，评估多个无监督模型和提出的注意力聚焦变压器模型，模型采用自注意力机制，通过重建训练并从注意力权重偏差获取异常分数。

Result: 基于变压器的模型总体表现更好，但所有测试模型对高频局部噪声都很脆弱，提出的模型精度与现有水平相当且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 未来间接结构健康监测模型需增强噪声鲁棒性，提出的基于注意力的方法是开发实用车载异常检测系统的有前景基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

Conclusion: 为RLVR提供了理论依据，解释了实际启发式方法的有效性，指出固定学习率下成功率可能无法达到100%。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

<details>

Motivation: 解决大型快速演变图中动态信任评估问题，需模型捕捉关系变化、表达校准信心并抵御对抗操作。

Method: 结合不确定性感知消息传递、表达性时间建模和内置防御机制；用高斯分布表示节点和边；采用HAGH位置编码和基于K - A网络的多头注意力，用ODE残差学习模块；用鲁棒自适应集成系数分析。

Result: 在两个比特币信任网络上，单时隙预测、冷启动场景和对抗攻击下，MCC均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 统一的DGTEN框架有效。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

Result: GDPO在多个数学、推理和编码基准测试中比预训练模型有持续提升，且优于先进基线diffu - GRPO。

Conclusion: GDPO是一种有效的针对DLMs的强化学习算法，能在有限评估预算下降低方差。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 对大语言模型机器遗忘进行全面回顾，为未来方法设计和评估提供可行指导。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Result: 建立了理论帕累托前沿，提出了平衡后悔最小化和推理准确性的算法。

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效解决MABNI中后悔最小化和推理准确性的权衡问题。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Result: 在标准5任务Split CIFAR - 10基准和ResNet - 18架构上，ICS能维持初始任务的强性能，但长期知识保留有局限，任务数量增加时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 持续学习存在复杂性和权衡问题，为后续研究指出方向。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布强化学习方法在估计回报分布时，未解决回报分布细粒度结构及区分高回报不确定性状态的问题。

Method: 使用流模型估计完整未来回报分布，提出新的流匹配目标，用流导数ODE估计状态回报不确定性，并利用该信息优先学习某些过渡的更准确回报估计。

Result: 在37个基于状态和25个基于图像的基准任务实验中，Value Flows平均成功率提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: Value Flows方法在估计回报分布和提升成功率方面表现良好。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Conclusion: LiveThinking框架能有效提升实时交互场景下用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 解决常规GRFs在建模远距离节点关系等方面的长期局限性。

Method: 采用新的walk - stitching技术减少对长图随机游走采样的依赖；将简单的GRFs游走终止机制扩展到更广泛的策略。

Result: GRFs++继承长游走的近似质量且更高效，提高图核的近似精度且不增加额外计算成本。

Conclusion: GRFs++是一种有效且准确的用于涉及图节点核计算的方法。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: DEAS是一个简单有效的离线强化学习框架，可用于复杂长程决策任务。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: LBSN轨迹数据收集成本高且有隐私问题，现有合成数据生成在生成LBSN签到轨迹上有挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段从粗到细的GeoGen框架，第一阶段用S²TDiff模型学习潜在行为模式，第二阶段用Coarse2FineNet生成细粒度轨迹。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上实验表明，GeoGen在保真度和实用性评估上优于现有模型，如在FS - TKY数据集上距离和半径指标分别提升超69%和55%。

Conclusion: GeoGen能有效解决大规模LBSN签到轨迹生成问题，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

Motivation: 递归模型在匹配计算下参数少性能落后，需解决未分化计算和信息过载瓶颈。

Method: 引入Memory - as - State - Highways (MeSH) 方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，用轻量级路由器使迭代计算多样化。

Result: MeSH解决了问题，在Pythia套件上，增强型递归变压器优于递归基线，在1.4B规模上超越非递归模型，平均下游准确率提高1.06%，非嵌入参数减少33%。

Conclusion: MeSH是构建更强递归模型的可扩展且有原则的架构。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding

cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

Result: 在8个跨多领域和任务的基准测试中，FedBook始终优于21个基线模型。

Conclusion: FedBook在构建联邦图基础码本上有效且性能优越。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Conclusion: Rényi sharpness是有效的锐度度量，RSAM方法可提升神经网络泛化性能。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效。

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 层自适应调制方案能有效解决无线联邦学习的通信延迟问题。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Conclusion: 所采用的方法可从高度稀疏实验数据中学习昆虫种群运动的有效模型。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Method: 提出SIMU，一个两步框架，通过选择性更新负责编码遗忘集的关键神经元来增强二阶优化器的遗忘方法。

Result: SIMU在遗忘效果上相当，但在保留模型原始知识方面远超当前方法。

Conclusion: SIMU能在实现机器遗忘的同时，有效保留模型的原始知识和整体效用。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

Conclusion: MetaDefense是一种有效的防御大语言模型微调越狱攻击的框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is critical in nanotechnology, materials
science, and biological imaging due to its high spatial resolution and depth of

and software standpoint. We review traditional and emerging techniques,
focusing on their applications, advantages, and limitations. The paper aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of SNR optimization in SEM for
researchers and practitioners and to encourage further research in the field.

Conclusion: AO - GPRLLSR滤波管道能有效估计SEM图像的SNR和NV，用NV引导维纳滤波器可提升图像质量。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Motivation: 药物推荐中药物 - 药物相互作用（DDI）风险是挑战，以往基于GNN的方法不能充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性。

Method: 提出MMM框架，用ELF生成3D电子密度图，结合ELF衍生特征和二分图编码器学习药物分子互补特征。

Result: 在MIMIC - III数据集评估，与基线模型相比，F1分数、Jaccard指数和DDI率有统计学显著改善。

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的联合用药。

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Result: 该方法有效提高SNN的判别能力和整体性能，增强其对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法巧妙利用SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本高，现有方法中锚点选择依赖聚类，复杂且对设计选择敏感。

Method: 提出Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)方法，选择模型分歧最大的top-k样本，利用贪心、样本级统计而非全局聚类。

Result: DISCO在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等数据集的性能预测上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DISCO方法概念更简单，在性能预测方面优于先前方法。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE框架在单细胞扰动预测中有效，可过滤不可信结果，提高预测准确性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

Conclusion: 回答了MGS有效性理论原因及能否消除差距问题，填补了去中心化训练理论空白。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

Result: 在五个模型上评估，剪枝后在多种攻击场景下展现强恶意行为，有较高成功率。

Conclusion: 揭示了模型压缩在部署时的关键安全缺口，强调需增强安全意识。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

TL;DR: 本文实证表明，在合适的softmax温度校准下，不进行参数置换，仅加宽模型就能实现线性模式连通性（LMC），并通过分析中间层输出解释了现象原因。


<details>

Motivation: 以往研究认为实现LMC需合适的置换搜索和足够宽的模型，本文探索不进行置换仅加宽模型实现LMC的可能性。

Method: 通过实证研究，引入层间指数加权连通性（LEWC）分析中间层输出。

Result: 在合适的softmax温度校准下，不进行置换仅加宽模型可实现LMC，合并模型输出与原模型集成输出匹配。

Conclusion: 加宽模型不仅有助于非线性模式连通性，还显著增加实现线性模式连通性的可能性。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

Result: 配备该层的模型优于仅共享权重的模型和单独训练的主体特定模型的平均表现。

Conclusion: Subject - Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨主体EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

Method: 提出一种显式分离领域分布并自适应捕获特定实例领域信息的方法。

Result: 所提方法在实验中优于基于VLM调整技术的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为VLMs中实用且细粒度的遗忘铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

Motivation: 现有GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，现有熵正则化方法不能完全解决，且熵控制及熵、探索和性能关系不明。

Method: 提出AEPO方法，用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，通过温度调节稳定熵，集成三种关键设计实现精确熵控制。

Result: AEPO能将熵稳定在任意目标水平，消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示熵与性能的非单调关系；提供更广泛的RFT范式。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决熵崩溃问题，明确熵相关关系，提供更通用范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Conclusion: 该框架在推理优化模型族中表现稳定，置信机制是现代后训练推理系统的显著特征。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Conclusion: GALA是一个可扩展且鲁棒的联邦UMDA框架，能在大量异构源上进行稳定且可并行的训练。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

Result: 在多类和多标签任务的各种长尾基准测试中，MORE显著提升泛化能力，尤其对尾部类别，还能有效补充现有不平衡缓解方法。

Conclusion: MORE有潜力成为长尾场景下强大的即插即用模块。

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人领域因缺乏可扩展性未充分应用，现有离线强化学习方法依赖BPTT或策略蒸馏，存在计算成本高和误差累积问题，需开发不依赖这些的可扩展方法。

Method: 提出Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR)方法，训练时通过流匹配学习最优正则化Q函数，推理时通过拒绝采样针对表达性价值函数进行策略提取。

Result: EVOR在多种离线强化学习任务上优于基线。

Conclusion: 将表达性价值学习集成到离线强化学习中有益。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出后验随机概念瓶颈模型（PSCBMs），在不重新训练骨干模型的情况下增强预训练CBM，在测试时提升性能，干预下表现更好且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖的方法需重新训练整个模型，在数据或计算资源有限时不可行，因此需新方法。

Method: 提出PSCBMs，通过添加小的协方差预测模块，用多元正态分布增强预训练CBM，并提出两种训练策略。

Result: 在真实数据上，PSCBMs在测试时能匹配或提高概念和目标准确性，干预下比CBMs表现好，且比从头训练随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能有效增强预训练CBM，提升性能并在干预下有良好表现。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

Motivation: 在动荡、高风险环境中进行序列决策时，需要原则性的不确定性管理。

Method: 提出Uncertainty - Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP)框架，结合贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束下的规划，在闭环中更新潜在动态的信念、采样未来并优化策略。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制领域，相对于深度学习基线，UAMDP提高了长期预测准确性，改善了经济表现，如交易夏普比率提升，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、与后验不确定性一致的探索和风险感知控制，能产生一种稳健、可推广的方法，用于更安全和更盈利的序列决策。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型有高推理吞吐量潜力，但缺乏适合其特性的强化学习算法，需提升推理能力以媲美自回归大语言模型。

Method: 提出Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO)方法，通过交叉熵优化使模型策略分布匹配最优奖励倾斜分布，针对小批量训练提出权重基线减法技术解决方案。

Result: DMPO在多个推理基准测试中无需监督微调，准确率比先前SOTA基线最高提升42.9%，比基础模型最高提升55.8%。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架有效，DMPO能提升扩散大语言模型推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

Motivation: 大语言模型影响力渐增，了解其在政治领域潜在偏见对防止影响舆论和民主进程至关重要。

Method: 用二维政治指南针测试（PCT）评估模型政治倾向，通过PCT进行角色提示探索显式刻板印象，用多语言PCT评估模型发现隐式刻板印象。

Result: 所有模型都有左倾政治倾向；模型间刻板印象性质和程度差异大，隐式刻板印象比显式更明显；多数模型隐式和显式刻板印象有显著一致性。

Conclusion: 强调了大语言模型中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实世界部署规模扩大，多智能体交互不可避免，需要了解其战略行为，探究LLM智能体能否像强化学习智能体一样通过交互影响其他智能体学习动态。

Method: 引入ShapeLLM，这是一种针对基于Transformer的智能体的无模型OS方法。

Result: LLM智能体在竞争游戏中能引导对手达到可利用均衡，在合作游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体可以通过交互进行塑造和被塑造，对手塑造是多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO公式依赖单一整体模型，在多任务场景表达性和对不同偏好分布适应性受限。

Method: 用随机变分推理方法，扩展DPO加入软混合模型和专家混合（MoE）架构，引入潜在变量模型优化变分证据下界。

Result: 在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证，Mix - and MoE - DPO比标准DPO有泛化、奖励和策略专业化、上下文对齐优势。

Conclusion: Mix - and MoE - DPO是一种强大且可扩展的基于偏好的大语言模型对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Result: 在谐波振荡器、人类活动识别和锂离子电池降解实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测准确性提高18.5%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在生成质量、减少物理违规和提高预测准确性方面优于基线。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI为构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

Result: 实证结果表明RPEL在对抗环境保持鲁棒性，精度与全连接通信相当，在大型网络有效扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL是一种可扩展的协作方法，能在有对手情况下确保鲁棒学习。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Result: 通过合成和真实专家数据实验，LtA为有效人机协作提供更灵活强大基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架能更好地实现人类与AI的协作，是一种更优的决策支持系统方法。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

Method: 理论证明、训练动态分析、随机超参数搜索、在奥赛罗模型中测试。

Result: 证明了单层注意力变压器的嵌入和值维度的边界；若模型在长度1和2时实现平衡对数位移，则能泛化到更长序列但精度降低；验证了dropout和EMA的作用；EMA在奥赛罗模型中改善长度泛化。

Conclusion: dropout和EMA能改善变压器的长度泛化能力，在不同任务中均有效。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

Result: 在多种指标上优于临床医生和指南策略，估计死亡率降低3.7 ± 0.17个百分点，关键营养生物标志物改善。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的个性化肠内营养疗法有潜力超越传统方法改善治疗结果。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

Conclusion: 研究为在处理能力有限的边缘/雾环境中部署对比学习的资源影响提供见解，为未来优化开辟研究方向。

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA存在参数干扰问题，基于MoE的LoRA变体在多任务模型合并中低效，需要新的改进方法。

Method: 受苍蝇嗅觉回路启发，提出FlyLoRA，包括在投影矩阵中按秩激活专家和采用隐式路由器。

Result: 在四个领域实验中，FlyLoRA性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA解决了任务内去相关和计算效率的权衡，缓解任务间干扰，证明生物结构能启发AI技术创新。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共聚焦荧光显微镜观察牙齿最小亚微观孔隙血管时视野受限，需新方法克服局限。

Method: 应用三种有监督2D SR模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN）和一种无监督模型（CycleGAN）处理不同采样方案获得的高低分辨率图像对，用图像质量评估指标量化性能，对生成图像进行分割、连通分量分析及图分析。

Result: 图像质量评估指标结果与视觉感知大多矛盾，生物学驱动评估能更好解释超分辨率性能。

Conclusion: 标准图像质量评估指标对牙齿孔隙特定结构不适用，生物学驱动评估有助于理解超分辨率模型性能。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Motivation: 现有基于PAC - Bayes理论的泛化边界不能充分解释提示工程技术在数据稀缺场景的成功，需更好解释。

Method: 考虑数据或分布依赖的困惑度作为有效先验，推导新的泛化边界，实证探索边界有效性和困惑度正则化的实际益处。

Result: 推导出在数据稀缺的提示优化中非空的泛化边界，实证探索了边界有效性和困惑度正则化对提高提示泛化性的实际好处。

Conclusion: 通过考虑困惑度能更充分解释提示工程技术的成功，困惑度正则化有助于提高提示泛化性。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO适应扩散模型有挑战，依赖低效SDE采样器收敛慢。

Method: 提出Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO)，直接从组级偏好学习，无需低效随机策略。

Result: DGPO训练速度比现有最优方法快约20倍，在内外域奖励指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: DGPO能有效解决现有方法在扩散模型中的问题，实现更快训练和更好性能。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Motivation: 现代大语言模型部署中，高级模型推理强但成本高，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱，现有静态规则和启发式方法未能充分利用成本 - 性能差异。

Method: 提出xRouter路由系统，用强化学习端到端训练路由模型，使用明确的、考虑成本的奖励函数。

Conclusion: 研究结果和开源实现可作为推进学习型、考虑成本的大语言模型编排的实用基础。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多是启发式的，需严谨框架分类。

Method: 提出九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)框架，结合高斯传播统计、渐近斜率和正则性度量；进行动力学分析和核视角推导。

Result: 建立了良好性、仿射重参数化规律和有界斜率变化下的闭包；得到李雅普诺夫定理和方差稳定区域；导出无维数Hessian界；分类八种标准激活函数；数值验证符合理论预测。

Conclusion: 框架为激活函数选择提供原则性设计指导，从试错转向可证明的稳定性和核条件。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

Result: SummDiff在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，生成的摘要与个体标注者偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: SummDiff有效解决视频摘要问题，且通过对背包问题分析提供了新的评估见解。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

Conclusion: 将上下文学习扩展到无监督场景，展示了大语言模型用于聚类的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 利用未配对多模态数据的UML范式可有效提升目标模态表征学习效果。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting
rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control
(OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant
colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions
requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides
the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of
eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital
ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences,
representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a
Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such
as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection
of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified
Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an
Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics,
imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base
Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score - the sum of the
Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score - is used as the
main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of
transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach
provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and
predictive maintenance in industrial environments.

Conclusion: LNMs为更具扩展性和高性能的脉冲架构提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative
to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by utilizing sparse and asynchronous
processing through discrete spike-based computation. However, the performance
of deep SNNs remains limited by their reliance on simple neuron models, such as
the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which cannot capture rich temporal
dynamics. While more expressive neuron models exist, they require careful
manual tuning of hyperparameters and are difficult to scale effectively. This
difficulty is evident in the lack of successful implementations of complex
neuron models in high-performance deep SNNs. In this work, we address this
limitation by introducing Learnable Neuron Models (LNMs). LNMs are a general,
parametric formulation for non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics that learn
neuron dynamics during training. By learning neuron dynamics directly from
data, LNMs enhance the performance of deep SNNs. We instantiate LNMs using
low-degree polynomial parameterizations, enabling efficient and stable
training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets,
including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS. LNMs offer a
promising path toward more scalable and high-performing spiking architectures.

Result: 提出用于各向同性形状分类的旋转不变NCA模型。

Conclusion: 该平台为探索NCA物理实现提供坚实基础，有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a rotation-invariant embedded platform for simulating
(neural) cellular automata (NCA) in modular robotic systems. Inspired by
previous work on physical NCA, we introduce key innovations that overcome
limitations in prior hardware designs. Our platform features a symmetric,
modular structure, enabling seamless connections between cells regardless of
orientation. Additionally, each cell is battery-powered, allowing it to operate
independently and retain its state even when disconnected from the collective.
To demonstrate the platform's applicability, we present a novel
rotation-invariant NCA model for isotropic shape classification. The proposed
system provides a robust foundation for exploring the physical realization of
NCA, with potential applications in distributed robotic systems and
self-organizing structures. Our implementation, including hardware, software
code, a simulator, and a video, is openly shared at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不清楚何时需要进行形态 - 控制协同设计。

Method: 提出统一框架，将形态和控制参数嵌入单个神经网络进行端到端联合优化，以静态障碍物约束的到达任务为例进行研究。

Result: 形态与任务不匹配时，协同设计有明显优势；基线形态能力足够时，仅控制优化常能达到或超越协同设计。

Conclusion: 明确了何时仅需控制优化，何时需要协同设计，促进对具身智能的理解，为具身感知的机器人设计提供实用指导。

Abstract: Robotic performance emerges from the coupling of body and controller, yet it
remains unclear when morphology-control co-design is necessary. We present a
unified framework that embeds morphology and control parameters within a single
neural network, enabling end-to-end joint optimization. Through case studies in
static-obstacle-constrained reaching, we evaluate trajectory error, success
rate, and collision probability. The results show that co-design provides clear
benefits when morphology is poorly matched to the task, such as near obstacles
or workspace boundaries, where structural adaptation simplifies control.
Conversely, when the baseline morphology already affords sufficient capability,
control-only optimization often matches or exceeds co-design. By clarifying
when control is enough and when it is not, this work advances the understanding
of embodied intelligence and offers practical guidance for embodiment-aware
robot design.

### [225] [Modeling Developer Burnout with GenAI Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07435)
*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究生成式AI采用与开发者倦怠的关系，发现其增加工作需求致倦怠，工作资源和积极认知可缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究强调生成式AI对软件开发生产力的提升，而本文关注其对开发者幸福感的负面影响，研究其与开发者倦怠的关系。

Method: 采用工作需求 - 资源（JD - R）模型，运用并发嵌入式混合研究方法，先对442名开发者进行调查，再用偏最小二乘 - 结构方程模型（PLS - SEM）和回归分析建模，结合定性分析。

Result: 生成式AI的采用通过增加工作需求加剧了开发者的倦怠，而工作资源和对生成式AI的积极看法可缓解这些影响。

Conclusion: 生成式AI采用虽增加倦怠，但工作资源和积极认知可将其转化为机会。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准未专门针对热修复，需构建专注热修复的数据集。

Method: 从10个活跃Apache项目中挖掘提交和问题报告，确定符合热修复标准的软件补丁，经手动评估筛选，集成可复现案例并提供丰富元数据。

Result: 确定746个软件补丁，679个为真正热修复，110个可复现，HotBugs.jar被用作SBSE会议挑战赛道官方数据集。

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar基准数据集能推动现代软件系统快速调试、自动修复和生产级弹性工具的研究。

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用 Rust 提高软件安全性，需将现有 C 代码库转换为 Rust 代码。

Method: 使用大语言模型自动转换 C 代码到 Rust，运用提示工程技术，进行差分符号测试。

Result: 对五个真实应用和库评估，能为 89.8% 的 C 函数生成可编译的 Rust 函数，其中 69.9% 的 C 和 Rust 函数有等价符号返回值。

Conclusion: RustAssure 能有效将 C 代码转换为 Rust 代码并保证一定语义等价性。

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法评估大语言模型从无到有构建完整软件系统的能力，需新基准测试。

Method: 设计多智能体系统从应用文档总结功能、合成测试用例，构建 APPFORGE 基准测试，含自动评估框架。

Result: 对 12 个旗舰大语言模型评估显示，表现最好的 GPT - 5 仅开发出 18.8% 功能正确的应用。

Conclusion: 当前模型在处理复杂多组件软件工程挑战方面存在根本局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出用于MLIR的自适应性模糊测试框架FLEX，能生成高质量测试用例，在实验中发现大量未知漏洞，代码覆盖率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLIR模糊测试方法难以生成多样且语义有效的测试用例，难以暴露其复杂代码空间中的漏洞。

Method: 利用神经网络进行程序生成，采用扰动采样策略促进多样性，通过反馈驱动的增强循环迭代改进模型。

Result: 在30天测试中发现80个未知漏洞，24小时固定版本比较中检测到53个（是最佳基线的3.5倍多），代码覆盖率28.2%，优于其他工具。

Conclusion: 扰动生成和多样性增强对FLEX的有效性起着关键作用。

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出IssueMut从编译器漏洞历史中提取模糊测试变异器，能发现新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器漏洞影响大，变异模糊测试器有效性取决于变异器质量，此前无人用编译器漏洞历史作为变异器来源。

Method: 使用自动化方法从漏洞报告中挖掘变异器并应用到现有变异编译器模糊测试器中。

Result: 从1760个GCC和LLVM漏洞报告中挖掘587个变异器，发现GCC 28个、LLVM 37个新漏洞，60个被确认或修复。

Conclusion: 漏洞历史包含丰富信息，编译器模糊测试器应加以利用。

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AUTOSAR标准下的集成SoC软件架构存在安全挑战，缺乏对其漏洞根因和影响的系统分析。

Method: 分析180个公开的汽车SoC漏洞，映射到符合AUTOSAR原则的代表性SoC软件架构模型。

Result: 确定16个根因和56个受影响软件模块，揭示主导漏洞模式和补丁延迟的关键模块。

Conclusion: 为基于SoC的车辆平台的SoC软件架构提供改进检测、优先级排序和定位策略的指南，保障汽车CPS平台安全。

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: 该框架能加速响应时间、改善协作，增强软件维护实践，实现高效以用户为中心的未来。

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

Result: 通过重构简化版Python编程语言对该方法进行评估。

Conclusion: 该解决方案旨在提高现有语言组件的复用性，减少开发时间，提高软件语言整体质量。

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

Motivation: 解决P2P借贷中投资者通过分散投资降低风险时，最小化贷款组合的VaR或CVaR的问题。

Method: 提出低自由度深度神经网络模型DeNN和高自由度模型DSNN，预测贷款违约概率和违约时间。

Result: 两模型在不同置信水平下显著降低投资组合VaR，DeNN在多数场景表现优于DSNN。

Conclusion: DeNN和DSNN模型对P2P借贷风险管理有效，低自由度的DeNN更具优势。

Abstract: Risk management is a prominent issue in peer-to-peer lending. An investor may
naturally reduce his risk exposure by diversifying instead of putting all his
money on one loan. In that case, an investor may want to minimize the
Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of his loan portfolio.
We propose a low degree of freedom deep neural network model, DeNN, as well as
a high degree of freedom model, DSNN, to tackle the problem. In particular, our
models predict not only the default probability of a loan but also the time
when it will default. The experiments demonstrate that both models can
significantly reduce the portfolio VaRs at different confidence levels,
compared to benchmarks. More interestingly, the low degree of freedom model,
DeNN, outperforms DSNN in most scenarios.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets present unique prediction challenges due to their
extreme volatility, 24/7 operation, and hypersensitivity to news events, with
existing approaches suffering from key information extraction and poor sideways
market detection critical for risk management. We introduce a
theoretically-grounded multi-agent cryptocurrency trend prediction framework
that advances the state-of-the-art through three key innovations: (1) an
information-preserving news analysis system with formal theoretical guarantees
that systematically quantifies market impact, regulatory implications, volume
dynamics, risk assessment, technical correlation, and temporal effects using
large language models; (2) an adaptive volatility-conditional fusion mechanism
with proven optimal properties that dynamically combines news sentiment and
technical indicators based on market regime detection; (3) a distributed
multi-agent coordination architecture with low communication complexity
enabling real-time processing of heterogeneous data streams. Comprehensive
experimental evaluation on Bitcoin across three prediction horizons
demonstrates statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
natural language processing baseline, establishing a new paradigm for financial
machine learning with broad implications for quantitative trading and risk
management systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large
Language Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the
cryptocurrencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme
volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and
regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static
regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53].
The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised
agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and
performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal
feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly
natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are
then injected into future prompts, allowing the system to adjust indicator
priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates
or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025
shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantitative agent
delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains
versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets
from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further
improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The
results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and
low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.

Conclusion: 费用贝塔的不确定性是银行股票不可对冲风险的新来源，凸显了美联储零利率政策的额外好处。

Abstract: Research has shown banks match interest income and expense betas, and thereby
obtain net interest income margins which are insensitive to changes in
short-term interest rates. The present analysis extends this research in a
number of ways. First, we use state-space methods to estimate time-varying
betas and test whether they are matched at each time interval. We find
substantial variation in interest income and expense betas, which drives
variation in net interest margin beta coefficients. Second, we estimate the
time-varying conditional volatility of beta forecasts the uncertainty of future
beta values. We find uncertainty in interest expense beta coefficients drives
uncertainty in interest income betas. Further, large banks have greater expense
beta uncertainty, whereas small banks have greater income beta uncertainty.
Lastly, we find evidence that uncertainty in interest expense betas is priced
by the market, and is negatively related to bank stock prices. This is a new
and previously unmeasured source of unhedgeable risk in bank stocks, and
highlights an additional benefit of the Federal Reserve's Zero Interest Rate
Policy.

Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning
state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While
Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training
paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to
Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However,
these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable
in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative
models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address
this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function
is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a
policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a
theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and
extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as
tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the
code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .

Motivation: 常用交叉验证方法不能直接估计推荐用于未来的特定模型的性能。

Result: 模拟和真实数据示例表明，提出的方法性能优于传统交叉验证估计器和朴素单分割估计器。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法在估计特定训练集训练模型的性能方面表现更优。

Abstract: Cross-validation is a standard tool for obtaining a honest assessment of the
performance of a prediction model. The commonly used version repeatedly splits
data, trains the prediction model on the training set, evaluates the model
performance on the test set, and averages the model performance across
different data splits. A well-known criticism is that such cross-validation
procedure does not directly estimate the performance of the particular model
recommended for future use. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate
the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive
estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set.
Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can
be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model
framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and
an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both
the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split
estimator. Simulations and a real-data example demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method.

Result: 框架易实现、适用广，比现有方法有更优有限样本性能。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个有原则的数据驱动方法，能指导鲁棒性选择，助力高风险决策。

Abstract: Robust optimization safeguards decisions against uncertainty by optimizing
against worst-case scenarios, yet their effectiveness hinges on a prespecified
robustness level that is often chosen ad hoc, leading to either insufficient
protection or overly conservative and costly solutions. Recent approaches using
conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample
coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer
little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework
that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage
and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method
constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto
frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate
robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is
simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization
formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing
approaches. These results offer the first principled data-driven methodology
for guiding robustness selection and empower practitioners to balance
robustness and conservativeness in high-stakes decision-making.

Conclusion: 所开发的近似方案能解决图划分问题在数据点增多时计算复杂度高的问题，可用于空间预测的可解释决策。

Abstract: Spatial prediction refers to the estimation of unobserved values from
spatially distributed observations. Although recent advances have improved the
capacity to model diverse observation types, adoption in practice remains
limited in industries that demand interpretability. To mitigate this gap,
surrogate models that explain black-box predictors provide a promising path
toward interpretable decision making. In this study, we propose a graph
partitioning problem to construct spatial segments that minimize the sum of
within-segment variances of individual predictions. The assignment of data
points to segments can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming
problem. While this formulation potentially enables the identification of exact
segments, its computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the number of
data points increases. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an approximation
scheme that leverages the structural properties of graph partitioning.
Experimental results demonstrate the computational efficiency of this
approximation in identifying spatial segments.

Result: 证明Fisher - tracking策略在固定置信和固定预算制度下有最优表现，克服固定预算设置中的关键技术挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为简单高效的自适应测试程序提供了严格的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a continuous ability parameter from
sequential binary responses by actively asking questions with varying
difficulties, a setting that arises naturally in adaptive testing and online
preference learning. Our goal is to certify that the estimate lies within a
desired margin of error, using as few queries as possible. We propose a simple
algorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and
updates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel
test statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that
this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both
fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the
best-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical
challenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the
evolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural
symmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's
inequality. Our results provide rigorous theoretical support for simple and
efficient adaptive testing procedures.

Result: MoM在有限方差分布类以及具有无限方差和有限绝对(1 + r)阶矩的分布类中是（极小极大）最优的，给出的误差下界与上界阶数匹配，且在轻尾分布中次优。

Conclusion: 明确了对抗性污染下MoM在不同分布类中的（极小极大）最优性和局限性。

Abstract: The Median-of-Means (MoM) is a robust estimator widely used in machine
learning that is known to be (minimax) optimal in scenarios where samples are
i.i.d. In more grave scenarios, samples are contaminated by an adversary that
can inspect and modify the data. Previous work has theoretically shown the
suitability of the MoM estimator in certain contaminated settings. However, the
(minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination
remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and
lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple
classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal
in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of
distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment. We
also provide lower bounds for MoM's error that match the order of the presented
upper bounds, and show that MoM is sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: StiCTAF方法能实现准确的模态覆盖和各向异性尾建模，同时保持精确的密度评估和稳定的优化。

Abstract: Normalizing flows with a Gaussian base provide a computationally efficient
way to approximate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, but they
often struggle to capture complex posteriors with multimodality and heavy
tails. We propose a stick-breaking mixture base with component-wise tail
adaptation (StiCTAF) for posterior approximation. The method first learns a
flexible mixture base to mitigate the mode-seeking bias of reverse KL
divergence through a weighted average of component-wise ELBOs. It then
estimates local tail indices of unnormalized densities and finally refines each
mixture component using a shared backbone combined with component-specific tail
transforms calibrated by the estimated indices. This design enables accurate
mode coverage and anisotropic tail modeling while retaining exact density
evaluation and stable optimization. Experiments on synthetic posteriors
demonstrate improved tail recovery and better coverage of multiple modes
compared to benchmark models. We also present a real-data analysis illustrating
the practical benefits of our approach for posterior inference.

Abstract: Synthetic data can improve generalization when real data is scarce, but
excessive reliance may introduce distributional mismatches that degrade
performance. In this paper, we present a learning-theoretic framework to
quantify the trade-off between synthetic and real data. Our approach leverages
algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds, characterizing the
optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio that minimizes expected test error as a
function of the Wasserstein distance between the real and synthetic
distributions. We motivate our framework in the setting of kernel ridge
regression with mixed data, offering a detailed analysis that may be of
independent interest. Our theory predicts the existence of an optimal ratio,
leading to a U-shaped behavior of test error with respect to the proportion of
synthetic data. Empirically, we validate this prediction on CIFAR-10 and a
clinical brain MRI dataset. Our theory extends to the important scenario of
domain adaptation, showing that carefully blending synthetic target data with
limited source data can mitigate domain shift and enhance generalization. We
conclude with practical guidance for applying our results to both in-domain and
out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the progress in the development of generative models, their
usefulness in creating synthetic data that improve prediction performance of
classifiers has been put into question. Besides heuristic principles such as
"synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution", it is actually
not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper
addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression.
Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the covariance shift between
the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the
generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore we
prove that, in some settings, matching the covariance of the target
distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights from linear
models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the covariance matching procedure (matching the covariance of
the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution)
performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection,
across training paradigms, architectures, datasets and generative models used
for augmentation.

Result: 证明标准二元分类中PAC可学习的假设空间在考虑的性能场景下仍可学习。

Conclusion: 所提出的性能风险最小化方法在合成数据和真实数据上有优势。

Abstract: Following the wide-spread adoption of machine learning models in real-world
applications, the phenomenon of performativity, i.e. model-dependent shifts in
the test distribution, becomes increasingly prevalent. Unfortunately, since
models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original
(unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased
test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when
performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the
classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate
several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in
the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels
and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which
depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type
performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a
classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative
risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard
binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered
performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of
our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic
and real data.

Method: 在高斯框架和线性自编码器下，分析潜在维度和停止时间的相互作用，确定提前停止以最小化生成和目标分布距离的条件。

Result: 低维表示适合更早终止，高维潜在空间需要更晚停止时间；合成和真实数据集实验验证提前停止可提高生成质量。

Conclusion: 为理解潜在维度如何影响样本质量提供理论基础，强调停止时间是LDMs的关键超参数。

Abstract: We identify and analyze a surprising phenomenon of Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs) where the final steps of the diffusion can degrade sample quality. In
contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical
stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in
LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between
latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear
autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is
needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions.
More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from
earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later
stopping time. We further establish that the latent dimension interplays with
other hyperparameters of the problem such as constraints in the parameters of
score matching. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate these
properties, underlining that early stopping can improve generative quality.
Together, our results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding how the
latent dimension influences the sample quality, and highlight stopping time as
a key hyperparameter in LDMs.

Conclusion: Dyson扩散模型优于现有的图扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models are central to generative modeling and have been adapted to
graphs by diffusing adjacency matrix representations. The challenge of having
up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially
mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite
their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to
distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc
features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the
learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to
analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing
us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building
on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian
Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the
adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate
that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms
existing graph diffusion models.

Abstract: A long-standing gap exists between the theoretical analysis of Markov chain
Monte Carlo convergence, which is often based on statistical divergences, and
the diagnostics used in practice. We introduce the first general convergence
diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo based on any f-divergence, allowing
users to directly monitor, among others, the Kullback--Leibler and the $\chi^2$
divergences as well as the Hellinger and the total variation distances. Our
first key contribution is a coupling-based `weight harmonization' scheme that
produces a direct, computable, and consistent weighting of interacting Markov
chains with respect to their target distribution. The second key contribution
is to show how such consistent weightings of empirical measures can be used to
provide upper bounds to f-divergences in general. We prove that these bounds
are guaranteed to tighten over time and converge to zero as the chains approach
stationarity, providing a concrete diagnostic. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method is a practical and competitive diagnostic tool.

Method: 在旋转坐标系中进行MFVI，旋转由涉及目标得分函数的交叉协方差矩阵的PCA确定，迭代此过程将目标逐渐转化为高斯分布。

Result: 相比标准MFVI，该方法近似更准确，且构建流状传输映射计算效率高，在贝叶斯推理任务中准确性更高、计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 提出的在旋转坐标系中进行MFVI的方法是一种高效、准确的近似推理方法。

Abstract: We propose to perform mean-field variational inference (MFVI) in a rotated
coordinate system that reduces correlations between variables. The rotation is
determined by principal component analysis (PCA) of a cross-covariance matrix
involving the target's score function. Compared with standard MFVI along the
original axes, MFVI in this rotated system often yields substantially more
accurate approximations with negligible additional cost.
  MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defines a rotation and a coordinatewise
map that together move the target closer to Gaussian. Iterating this procedure
yields a sequence of transformations that progressively transforms the target
toward Gaussian. The resulting algorithm provides a computationally efficient
way to construct flow-like transport maps: it requires only MFVI subproblems,
avoids large-scale optimization, and yields transformations that are easy to
invert and evaluate. In Bayesian inference tasks, we demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy than standard MFVI, while maintaining
much lower computational cost than conventional normalizing flows.

Motivation: 探究波兰消费者如何适应在线保险购买渠道以及影响其偏好的因素。

Method: 对100名不同人口特征的受访者进行结构化调查，探索购买频率、渠道使用等方面。

Result: 消费者明显转向数字工具，重视在线平台的速度等优势，但存在数据安全等障碍，出现混合模式，价格是主要决策因素，情感和心理因素仍有作用。

Conclusion: 保险公司应投资用户友好的数字体验并保留人工支持，进行战略全渠道整合，同时指出研究局限并提出未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper examines how Polish consumers are adapting to online insurance
purchasing channels and what factors influence their preferences. Drawing on a
structured survey of 100 respondents with varied demographic profiles, the
study explores purchasing frequency, channel usage, price sensitivity, trust,
and decision-making behaviors. Results indicate a clear shift toward digital
tools, with many consumers valuing the speed, convenience, and transparency of
online platforms, particularly for simple insurance products. However, barriers
remain, including concerns about data security, lack of personal guidance, and
difficulty understanding policy terms. A hybrid model is emerging, where online
tools are used for research and comparison, while traditional agents are
consulted for complex decisions. Respondents emphasized the importance of trust
and personal contact, showing that emotional and psychological factors still
play a role in digital adoption. Price was the dominant decision factor, but
many consumers also prioritized service quality and reliability. The study
concludes that insurers should invest in user-friendly digital experiences
while maintaining human support options. Strategic omnichannel integration is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究生成式AI在降低成本之外对市场结构和竞争的影响，解决AI使价格降低但进入市场更难的政策悖论。

Method: 在标准的两阶段差异化竞争框架中捕捉生成式AI的向心力量，分析其对产品差异、成本等的影响。

Result: 发现存在能力阈值，能力提升会使市场可持续企业数量减少、集中度增加但价格仍下降，结果在多种情况下成立，还提出两个用于执法的充分统计量。

Conclusion: 生成式AI能同时降低价格和增加进入难度，应测量相关数据判断主导力量，采取拓宽准入、促进模板多样性和互操作性的补救措施。

Abstract: Generative AI does more than cut costs. It pulls products toward a shared
template, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true
originality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in
a standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single
capability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers
marginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward.
When buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing
apart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the
template. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same
homogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen
the squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a
capability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and
in a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability
grows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under
broader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options,
capability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the
theory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a
conduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules
that strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can
lower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that
broaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the
price benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety. The paper thus
reconciles a live policy paradox. AI can make prices lower and entry harder at
the same time. It prescribes what to measure to tell which force is dominant in
practice.

### [256] [A data fusion approach for mobility hub impact assessment and location selection: integrating hub usage data into a large-scale mode choice model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08366)

TL;DR: 本文提出数据融合方法评估出行枢纽影响，以纽约首都区为例分析，得出枢纽位置对行为影响的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市面临交通拥堵和服务不均问题，出行枢纽是解决方案，但缺乏整合大规模出行模式与实际枢纽使用情况的行为模型来评估其影响。

Method: 提出数据融合方法，将观测到的出行枢纽使用情况纳入用合成出行数据估计的模式选择模型，识别受影响出行、构建多模式子选择集，用现场调查数据和实际出行计数校准特定枢纽参数。

Result: 对纽约首都区案例研究显示，两个已实施枢纽分别预计每天产生8.83和6.17次多模式出行，减少年车辆行驶里程20.37和13.16千英里，增加日消费者剩余4000美元和1742美元。

Conclusion: 位于城际走廊和城市周边、支持停车换乘模式的出行枢纽产生的行为影响最显著。

Abstract: As cities grapple with traffic congestion and service inequities, mobility
hubs offer a scalable solution to align increasing travel demand with
sustainability goals. However, evaluating their impacts remains challenging due
to the lack of behavioral models that integrate large-scale travel patterns
with real-world hub usage. This study presents a novel data fusion approach
that incorporates observed mobility hub usage into a mode choice model
estimated with synthetic trip data. We identify trips potentially affected by
mobility hubs and construct a multimodal sub-choice set, then calibrate
hub-specific parameters using on-site survey data and ground truth trip counts.
The enhanced model is used to evaluate mobility hub impacts on potential
demand, mode shift, reduced vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and increased
consumer surplus (CS). We apply this method to a case study in the Capital
District, NY, using data from a survey conducted by the Capital District
Transportation Authority (CDTA) and a mode choice model estimated using Replica
Inc. synthetic data. The two implemented hubs located near UAlbany Downtown
Campus and in Downtown Cohoes are projected to generate 8.83 and 6.17
multimodal trips per day, reduce annual VMT by 20.37 and 13.16 thousand miles,
and increase daily CS by $4,000 and $1,742, respectively. An evaluation of
potential hub candidates in the Albany-Schenectady-Troy metropolitan area with
the estimated models demonstrates that hubs located along intercity corridors
and at urban peripheries, supporting park-and-ride P+R patterns, yield the most
significant behavioral impacts.

Result: 项目收益对称时差异最终会消散，但时间可能很长；初始对称条件下偶然也会产生显著差异；引入轻微不对称会导致差异长期存在。

Conclusion: 精确刻画了差异持续或减少的条件，研究结果对类似选拔过程的算法公平干预设计和实施有参考价值。

Abstract: We study group fairness in the context of feedback loops induced by
meritocratic selection into programs that themselves confer additional
advantage, like college admissions. We introduce a novel stylized
inter-generational model for the setting and analyze it in situations where
there are no underlying differences between two populations. We show that, when
the benefit of the program (or the harm of not getting into it) is completely
symmetric, disparities between the two populations will eventually dissipate.
However, the time an accumulated advantage takes to dissipate could be
significant, and increases substantially as a function of the relative
importance of the program in conveying benefits. We also find that significant
disparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial
conditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a
slight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes
slightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these
instances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities
between groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a
permanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes
conditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus
on the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its
effectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that
further support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model. Our
findings are relevant for the design and implementation of algorithmic fairness
interventions in similar selection processes.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于数字孪生的动态去中心化区块链管理机制能在无集中控制的情况下管理区块链系统。

Abstract: The necessity of blockchain systems to remain decentralised limits current
solutions to blockchain governance and dynamic management, forcing a trade-off
between control and decentralisation. In light of the above, this work proposes
a dynamic and decentralised blockchain management mechanism based on digital
twins. To ensure decentralisation, the proposed mechanism utilises multiple
digital twins that the system's stakeholders control. To facilitate
decentralised decision-making, the twins are organised in a secondary
blockchain system that orchestrates agreement on, and propagation of decisions
to the managed blockchain. This enables the management of blockchain systems
without centralised control. A preliminary evaluation of the performance and
impact of the overheads introduced by the proposed mechanism is conducted
through simulation. The results demonstrate the proposed mechanism's ability to
reach consensus on decisions quickly and reconfigure the primary blockchain
with minimal overhead.

Abstract: With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models
(LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves
LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks,
as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks.
Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive
overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting
LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward
providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by
analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and
unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a
unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing
reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also
present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges
alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel
perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy
LLM communities.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) enable autonomous mobile agents to
operate smartphone user interfaces, yet vulnerabilities to UI-level attacks
remain critically understudied. Existing research often depends on conspicuous
UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting
stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and
stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:
malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during
human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android
Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)
low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious
apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a
touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical
touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)
one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level
iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,
keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate
across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and
representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we
observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios
(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a
fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate
implications for autonomous smartphone operation.

Motivation: 随着机器学习进入多领域，数据隐私和模型机密性受关注，隐私保护机器学习（PPML）可解决此问题，因此要对比评估FHE和GC用于安全神经网络推理的性能。

Method: 使用Microsoft SEAL库的CKKS方案（FHE）和IntelLabs的TinyGarble2.0框架（GC）实现两层神经网络，在半诚实威胁模型下评估推理输出误差、往返时间、峰值内存使用、通信开销和通信轮数。

Result: 模块化GC执行速度更快且内存消耗更低，FHE支持非交互式推理。

Conclusion: FHE和GC在安全神经网络推理中各有优劣，存在权衡。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is making its way into fields such as healthcare,
finance, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), and concerns over data privacy
and model confidentiality continue to grow. Privacy-preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without
revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation
techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work
presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network
inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS
scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework
(GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest
threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory
usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a
trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption,
while FHE supports non-interactive inference.

Motivation: 随着空中交通管理对易受攻击的ADS - B协议依赖增加，需确保其安全，提升AI入侵检测系统性能。

Method: 评估基于transformer编码器和xLSTM网络的两种深度学习IDS，采用迁移学习策略，先预训练良性ADS - B消息，再用含篡改消息的标记数据微调。

Result: 该方法优于现有方法，xLSTM的F1分数达98.9%，高于transformer的94.3%，xLSTM泛化能力经测试有效，xLSTM延迟7.26秒，transformer延迟2.1秒。

Conclusion: xLSTM性能更好但延迟可能限制时间关键操作，transformer检测性能较低但延迟小。

Abstract: With the growing reliance on the vulnerable Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol in air traffic management (ATM),
ensuring security is critical. This study investigates emerging machine
learning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two
deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the
other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first
xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving
pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data
containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach
outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that
progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an
F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on
unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.
Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the
xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh
interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.
While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at
the cost of lower detection performance.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the central role of homomorphism problems
(structure-preserving maps) in two complementary domains: database querying
over finite, graph-shaped data, and constraint solving over (potentially
infinite) structures. Building on the well-known equivalence between
conjunctive query evaluation and homomorphism existence, the first part focuses
on conjunctive regular path queries, a standard extension of conjunctive
queries that incorporates regular-path predicates. We study the fundamental
problem of query minimization under two measures: the number of atoms
(constraints) and the tree-width of the query graph. In both cases, we prove
the problem to be decidable, and provide efficient algorithms for a large
fragment of queries used in practice. The second part of the thesis lifts
homomorphism problems to automatic structures, which are infinite structures
describable by finite automata. We highlight a dichotomy, between homomorphism
problems over automatic structures that are decidable in non-deterministic
logarithmic space, and those that are undecidable (proving to be the more
common case). In contrast to this prevalence of undecidability, we then focus
on the language-theoretic properties of these structures, and show, relying on
a novel algebraic language theory, that for any well-behaved logic (a
pseudovariety), whether an automatic structure can be described in this logic
is decidable.

that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable,

systems. We also experimentally demonstrate that quantized ACR-GNN models are
lightweight while maintaining good accuracy and generalization capabilities
with respect to non-quantized models.

Motivation: 探究在有记录的偏差和启发式领域，人工智能是否能模拟人类行为，特别是在替代消费者场景中。

Method: 进行十项使用大语言模型的实验。

Result: 观察到LLMs有四种与人类行为不同的偏差，包括减少或纠正、放大人类偏差，表现出相反偏差，以及响应不一致。

Conclusion: 当LLMs用于模仿或预测消费者行为时，非人类的响应有问题，偏差来源不一定以人类为中心，也有助于关于人类能否被AI替代的辩论。

Abstract: When Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to replace consumers (e.g.,
synthetic data), it is often assumed that AI emulates established consumers,
and more generally human behaviors. Ten experiments with Large Language Models
(LLMs) investigate if this is true in the domain of well-documented biases and
heuristics. Across studies we observe four distinct types of deviations from
human-like behavior. First, in some cases, LLMs reduce or correct biases
observed in humans. Second, in other cases, LLMs amplify these same biases.
Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, LLMs sometimes exhibit biases opposite to
those found in humans. Fourth, LLMs' responses to the same (or similar) prompts
tend to be inconsistent (a) within the same model after a time delay, (b)
across models, and (c) among independent research studies. Such inconsistencies
can be uncharacteristic of humans and suggest that, at least at one point,
LLMs' responses differed from humans. Overall, unhuman-like responses are
problematic when LLMs are used to mimic or predict consumer behavior. These
findings complement research on synthetic consumer data by showing that sources
of bias are not necessarily human-centric. They also contribute to the debate
about the tasks for which consumers, and more generally humans, can be replaced
by AI.

Motivation: 可穿戴EEG设备产生大量未标注数据，而深度学习睡眠评分依赖大量标注数据，自监督学习可解决标注稀缺问题。

Method: 对一系列成熟的SSL方法进行研究，在两个睡眠数据库上评估，定义三种评估场景。

Result: SSL比监督基线分类性能最多提升10%，仅用5% - 10%标注数据就能达到超80%的临床级准确率，且表示对多种变化有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSL有潜力实现基于可穿戴EEG的高效睡眠分期，减少手动标注依赖，推动经济实惠的睡眠监测系统发展。

Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to
polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread
adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that
cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of
deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap,
leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation
effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for
sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established
SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon
Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and
wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of
home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios
are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and
cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves
classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains
particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade
accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the
supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL
representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics,
recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG,
reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of
affordable sleep monitoring systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making
and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the
focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the
collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be
"fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental
models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper
addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration
influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental
models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated
socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental
model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and
performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature
through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models
(domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the
dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the
purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 本文引入200个人与共享自动驾驶车辆（SAV）交互的数据集，通过两个案例研究展示其效用，为设计SAV对话界面提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAV可能成为交通系统重要部分，有效人机交互是重要研究领域，需数据集推动该领域研究。

Method: 引入开源人机对话数据集，包含文本和实证数据；通过随机森林建模和和弦图确定SAV接受度和感知服务质量的关键预测因素；将基于大语言模型的情感分析工具与传统基于词典的TextBlob方法进行基准测试。

Result: 关键预测因素中响应情感极性有重要影响；简单零样本大语言模型提示更接近用户报告的情感，但仍有局限性。

Conclusion: 为设计对话式SAV界面提供新见解，为高级情感建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统的进一步探索奠定基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Motivation: 常规AI模型因数据不平衡和标注有限，在检测低大小、亮度和对比度的肺结节时面临挑战，需提升检测效果。

Method: 使用带FPN骨干的Faster R - CNN，在混合数据集上训练，用基于大小、亮度和对比度的难度分数引导课程学习，与非课程基线对比，采用多种统计测试。

Result: 课程模型平均AUC为0.95（基线0.89，p < 0.001），敏感性和准确性提升，各难度级别均有改善，Grad - CAM可视化显示课程学习下注意力更聚焦。

Conclusion: 课程引导的合成增强能增强肺结节检测模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

Motivation: 量化慢性肝病各阶段和健康对照的肝血管体积，并评估其与肝功能和纤维化/门静脉高压生物标志物的相关性。

Method: 回顾性评估健康对照、非晚期和晚期慢性肝病患者，用3D U - Net模型对门静脉期钆塞酸增强3 - T MRI进行肝血管分割，比较总、肝和肝内门静脉体积比，并与多种指标关联。

Result: 共纳入197名受试者，不同组的血管体积比有差异，肝血管体积比与多种疾病指标有显著相关性。

Conclusion: 基于深度学习的肝血管容积测定能显示健康肝脏和慢性肝病阶段的差异，且与疾病严重程度标志物相关。

Abstract: Background: We aimed to quantify hepatic vessel volumes across chronic liver
disease stages and healthy controls using deep learning-based magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, and assess correlations with biomarkers for
liver (dys)function and fibrosis/portal hypertension.
  Methods: We assessed retrospectively healthy controls, non-advanced and
advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients using a 3D U-Net model for
hepatic vessel segmentation on portal venous phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3-T
MRI. Total (TVVR), hepatic (HVVR), and intrahepatic portal vein-to-volume
ratios (PVVR) were compared between groups and correlated with:
albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na)
score, and fibrosis/portal hypertension (Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] score, liver
stiffness measurement [LSM], hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG], platelet
count [PLT], and spleen volume).
  Results: We included 197 subjects, aged 54.9 $\pm$ 13.8 years (mean $\pm$
standard deviation), 111 males (56.3\%): 35 healthy controls, 44 non-ACLD, and
118 ACLD patients. TVVR and HVVR were highest in controls (3.9; 2.1),
intermediate in non-ACLD (2.8; 1.7), and lowest in ACLD patients (2.3; 1.0) ($p
\leq 0.001$). PVVR was reduced in both non-ACLD and ACLD patients (both 1.2)
compared to controls (1.7) ($p \leq 0.001$), but showed no difference between
CLD groups ($p = 0.999$). HVVR significantly correlated indirectly with FIB-4,
ALBI, MELD-Na, LSM, and spleen volume ($\rho$ ranging from -0.27 to -0.40), and
directly with PLT ($\rho = 0.36$). TVVR and PVVR showed similar but weaker
correlations.
  Conclusions: Deep learning-based hepatic vessel volumetry demonstrated
differences between healthy liver and chronic liver disease stages and shows
correlations with established markers of disease severity.

Motivation: 现有随机效应块自助法适用于平衡集群，需提出适用于集群大小高度不平衡场景的方法。

Method: 提出比例随机效应块自助法和修正随机效应块自助法。

Result: 两种新自助法在一般集群大小下具有Fisher一致性，模拟显示有限样本推断性能好，实际应用中改进了置信区间。

Conclusion: 新提出的两种自助法优于原随机效应块自助法和其他现有方法，可用于线性混合模型参数推断。

Abstract: Clustered data arise naturally in many scientific and applied research
settings where units are grouped within clusters. They are commonly analyzed
using linear mixed models to account for within-cluster correlations. This
article focuses on the scenario in which cluster sizes might be highly
unbalanced and proposes a proportional random effect block bootstrap and a
modified random effect block bootstrap, which are applicable in such cases and
accommodate general distributions of random effects and error terms. These
methods generalize the random effect block bootstrap, originally designed for
the balanced case, and can be used for inference on parameters of linear mixed
models or functions thereof. Both proposed bootstraps are shown to enjoy Fisher
consistency under general cluster sizes, while the original random effect block
bootstrap is consistent only for balanced clusters. Simulations demonstrate
strong finite sample inferential performance of the proposed bootstraps
relative to the random effect block bootstrap and other existing bootstrap
methods for clustered data. Application to the Oman rainfall enhancement trial
dataset, with cluster sizes ranging from 1 to 58, shows improved bootstrap
confidence intervals using the proposed bootstraps over the random effect block
bootstrap and a statistically significant effect of the ionization technology
on rainfall.

Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing
structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the
well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing
compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack
scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms
provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This
paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on
direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for
artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training
set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms
of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We
here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable
compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated
output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on
specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and
permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the
pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated
music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of
generative systems.

Method: 开发多数投票集成多个音频事件检测器的评估框架，引入IH@vid和IH@dur指标，提出无训练推理方法PFC，通过两阶段过程减轻插入幻觉。

Result: 实验显示现有模型存在严重插入幻觉，PFC平均减少超50%幻觉发生率和时长，不降低且有时提高传统音频质量和时间同步指标。

Conclusion: 本文首次正式定义、系统测量并有效减轻插入幻觉，为更可靠的视频到音频模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically
synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus
on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models
often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no
corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination
and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the
prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current
metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation
framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event
detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and
severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and
IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose
Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that
mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial
audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio
after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments
on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models
suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence
and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and
in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and
temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,
systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,
paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.

Abstract: Audio-based lyrics matching can be an appealing alternative to other

limited reproducibility and inconsistent baselines. In this work, we introduce
WEALY, a fully reproducible pipeline that leverages Whisper decoder embeddings
for lyrics matching tasks. WEALY establishes robust and transparent baselines,
while also exploring multimodal extensions that integrate textual and acoustic
features. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate
that WEALY achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
lack reproducibility. In addition, we provide ablation studies and analyses on
language robustness, loss functions, and embedding strategies. This work
contributes a reliable benchmark for future research, and underscores the
potential of speech technologies for music information retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、考虑布局的图例解析，提高了不同视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various

Result: IP 策略提升主流去噪模型性能，FFM 模型结合 IP 策略在解剖结构保留上达 SOTA。

Conclusion: 该研究为真实世界超低剂量 CT 去噪的数据不匹配问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

Method: 提出TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块；提出ImplausiBench基准测试，去除语言偏差。

Result: 以人类判断和大语言模型判断为标准进行性能评估。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为探索和改进多模态模型的物理合理性提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Result: 在三个HSI基准数据集上评估，模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 证明了文本语义与光谱 - 空间数据协同有效，为语义增强的HSI分类模型发展提供方向。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常为固定输入格式训练，而许多视频工作流需要不同粒度的用户控制混合。

Method: 将任务视为变分推理以近似组合分布，利用多个视频生成骨干网络处理任务约束；将问题分解为对退火分布序列的分步KL散度最小化，并提出上下文条件分解技术以规避局部最优。

Result: 实验表明该方法生成的样本在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 所提出的视频合成方法能有效满足不同粒度用户控制需求，在多方面表现更优。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR场景亮暗区域曝光差异大，RGB括号法易有伪影，研究能否仅用单张短曝光RAW图像重建UHDR场景。

Method: 引入两阶段UltraLED框架，先通过比率图进行曝光校正，再用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复；设计9档括号管道合成逼真UHDR图像并构建数据集。

Result: UltraLED显著优于现有单帧方法。

Conclusion: 仅用单张短曝光RAW图像可有效重建UHDR场景，代码和数据集公开。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic

self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

Method: 将SOTA的SwinIR模型与标准轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务上进行对比实验。

Result: SwinIR模型PSNR达39.03 dB，轻量级CNN达37.4 dB；CNN训练10个epoch收敛，SwinIR需132个epoch；CNN模型大小比SwinIR小超55倍。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能以显著更低的计算开销提供接近SOTA的结果，适用于资源受限的现实场景。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Conclusion: 方法有效提升Video - LLMs时间逻辑一致性，表明时间逻辑一致性是时间理解瓶颈，提升一致性可推动视频时间理解进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: NSG - VD具有优越性能，源代码可在https://github.com/ZSHsh98/NSG - VD获取。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Conclusion: 所提出的自举算法能有效解决细粒度视觉分类任务中的问题，具有较好性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: NExF技术能有效解决含强曝光变化数据的3D场景重建问题，实现高动态范围场景的准确视图合成。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Conclusion: rCM是推进大规模扩散蒸馏的实用且理论可靠的框架。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统有潜力，但需可靠感知系统，且要兼顾远近感知，同时自动驾驶硬件限制需关注小模型。

Method: 引入DTPQA基准，排除推理问题以聚焦感知能力，评估多个小视觉语言模型。

Result: 小模型在DTPQA上表现远不如人类，最佳小模型平均准确率约60%，人类约85%，人类样本量小有统计局限，模型在区分左右等任务上有挑战。

Conclusion: 当前小视觉语言模型在交通场景感知能力有待提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Motivation: 视觉强化学习中，高维图像数据里只有少量像素与任务相关，导致样本低效和学习不稳定，需解决资源浪费问题。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制Gaze，基于回报差异将相似视觉表示分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组进行训练。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准的操作任务中，样本效率提升达2.4倍，能解决基线方法无法学习的任务。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升视觉强化学习的样本效率，且无需修改底层算法和超参数。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLM内的注意力汇点，不清楚ViT中哪些视觉标记对理解和推理贡献大及信号传递效果，而ViT注意力汇点研究少且重要。

Method: 对ViT注意力汇点嵌入信息进行定性和定量分析，提出无训练和基于训练的方法利用信息。

Result: 明确ViT注意力汇点包含图像高级语义概念，通过利用这些标记，在多种LVLMs和视觉推理任务中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇点在增强视觉推理方面有未挖掘的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 现有视觉语言模型空间推理能力不足，本文提出渐进式构建空间智能方法，基于新数据集训练出SpatialLadder模型，性能超当前模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在不足，现有方法未建立感知和理解的分层基础。

Method: 构建多模态数据集SpatialLadder - 26k，设计三阶段渐进式训练框架，包括建立空间感知、发展空间理解和强化复杂推理。

Result: 训练出3B参数的SpatialLadder模型，在空间推理基准测试中表现优异，平均提升23.4%，超GPT - 4o和Gemini - 2.0 - Flash，在域外基准测试也有提升。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对构建强大的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑仅依靠文本指令，对编辑程度缺乏细粒度控制。

Method: 扩展现有图像编辑模型，引入标量编辑强度作为额外输入；训练轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型调制空间的系数；合成图像 - 编辑 - 指令 - 强度四元组数据集并过滤。

Result: Kontinuous Kontext能在多种操作中实现从微妙到强烈的编辑强度控制。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext提供了一种统一的方法，可在指令驱动的编辑中对编辑强度进行细粒度控制，无需特定属性训练。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建包含中美文化的VideoNorms基准，用其对多种开源视频大语言模型进行测试。

Result: 模型在规范违反判断、中国文化理解、提供非语言证据及正式非幽默语境中表现较差。

Conclusion: 强调需要进行有文化背景的视频语言模型训练，该基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Motivation: 现有记忆持久的视觉语言导航方法缺乏有效内存访问机制，且仅存储环境观察而忽略导航行为模式。

Method: 提出Memoir，包括语言条件世界模型、混合视点级内存和经验增强导航模型，利用想象作为检索机制。

Result: 在多种测试场景中显著提升，IR2R上SPL提升5.4%，训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: 对环境和行为记忆的预测性检索能实现更有效导航，想象引导范式有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

Method: 构建包含1000道精心设计的选择题的SciVideoBench基准，题目来自超25个学科的科学实验视频，并经半自动系统验证。

Result: 评估显示包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5 - VL在内的现有大模型存在显著性能不足。

Conclusion: 为大模型未来发展提供了有价值的见解和方向，有望推动多模态AI发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Result: 建立了理论框架，明确了重配置何时值得，关联了相关概念。

Conclusion: 基于此基础给出算法设计和系统集成的研究议程。

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$-$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

Abstract: Sparse linear algebra is a cornerstone of many scientific computing and

interface. We benchmark pyGinkgo's performance against state-of-the-art Python
libraries including SciPy, CuPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Results across
hardware from different vendors demonstrate that pyGinkgo consistently
outperforms existing Python tools in both sparse matrix vector (SpMV) product

Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware,
physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode
time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding
critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is
often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation
conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian
optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed
Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal
encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree
of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally,
we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide
optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost.
Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of
a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is
more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the
4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit
optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the
most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work
presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions
for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical
reservoir implementations across different material platforms.

guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its
evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object
condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step
(e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two
contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking
performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same
dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a
lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts
track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular,
hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference.
On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event
on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results
position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for
fast tracking.

Motivation: 大语言模型正在改变细胞生物学，推动虚拟细胞发展，因此进行全面综述。

Method: 提出统一分类法，将现有方法分为两种范式；确定三个核心任务并回顾相关模型、数据集、评估基准。

Result: 梳理了用于虚拟细胞建模的大语言模型的相关信息，包括分类、核心任务等。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 现代长上下文大语言模型在合成NIAH基准测试中表现良好，但现有测试忽略噪声上下文产生原因。提出HaystackCraft基准测试，实验显示模型在长上下文推理存在挑战，HaystackCraft是有价值的测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成NIAH基准测试忽略了噪声上下文源于有偏检索和代理工作流的情况，需要构建能反映现实因素的噪声长上下文来测试模型长上下文鲁棒性。

Method: 通过基于全英文维基百科超链接网络和多跳问题构建新的NIAH基准测试HaystackCraft，评估不同检索策略对干扰项组成、排序和下游LLM性能的影响，并将NIAH扩展到动态、依赖LLM的代理操作设置。

Result: 实验表明更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，基于图的重排序可提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰项；在代理测试中，先进模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT - 5会因自生成干扰项出现级联故障或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: 长上下文推理存在持续挑战，HaystackCraft是未来研究的有价值测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

TL;DR: 本文建立无损词汇缩减理论框架，使不同分词的语言模型能通过最大公共词汇高效协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词影响自回归语言模型文本生成效率，且不同模型在词汇层面难以协作。

Method: 建立无损词汇缩减的理论框架。

Result: 能将给定自回归语言模型转换为任意小词汇量且无精度损失的模型。

Conclusion: 不同分词的语言模型可通过最大公共词汇高效协作。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Motivation: 标准ASR评估指标如WER会不公平地惩罚不显著改变句子语义的形态和句法细微差别。

Method: 引入基于大语言模型的评分规则LASER，利用其上下文学习能力；用Gemini 2.5 Pro计算Hindi LASER分数；对小模型Llama 3在词对示例上微调。

Result: Hindi LASER分数与人工标注有94%的高相关性；Hindi示例对分析其他印度语言错误有效；Llama 3微调后预测惩罚准确率近89%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的评分规则LASER在ASR评估中有效，小模型微调也能取得较好效果。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

Conclusion: 扁平团队在多智能体系统中表现更优，团队协作存在协调等挑战。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

Motivation: 现有语音大模型处理复杂推理任务能力不足，需提升推理能力并控制响应延迟。

Method: 对多流语音大模型进行CoT微调；引入‘问题完整性’指标引导模型提前推理；用DPO优化偏好数据。

Result: CoT微调使语音大模型推理准确率平均提升2.4倍；提前推理方法在ARC - Easy上准确率提高4%；DPO优化在不损失准确率下延迟降低70%。

Conclusion: CoT微调、提前推理方法和DPO优化能有效提升语音大模型推理性能和控制响应延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型直接输入更多文档无法捕捉证据连接方式，需解决多跳推理中证据结合问题。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理转化为可复用思维缓存，提出迭代更新策略通过自然语言反馈优化模板。

Result: 在多种基准测试和长上下文语言模型家族中，相比强基线取得一致增益，优化模板可提炼到小开源模型。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架有效，具有广泛适用性和透明推理复用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

Motivation: 现有投机解码方法在长上下文实际场景中泛化性差，当前基准假设短上下文，与实际不符，现有方法在长上下文下性能严重下降。

Method: 发布新的长上下文基准LongSpecBench，提出新模型OWL，OWL有三项创新：基于LSTM且仅依赖最后标记状态的草稿生成器、验证器中的特殊标记[SPEC]、结合树与非树解码的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上的接受长度比EAGLE3高约5倍。

Conclusion: 发布的代码和数据集有助于推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Motivation: 在移动平台部署NLP模型，需模型在不同应用中适应且内存和计算高效，研究轻量级类BERT编码器预微调策略。

Method: 提出基于任务优先LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单个共享编码器主干和模块化适配器。

Result: 在21个下游任务实验中，命名实体识别平均提升0.8%，文本分类提升8.8%。

Conclusion: 所提方法对通用移动NLP应用有效，性能与单独预微调相当且满足实际部署约束。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Method: 对三个语料库（新冠虚假叙事、一般新冠内容、猴痘相关帖子）进行计算语言学分析，比较可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用。

Conclusion: 研究找出语言指标有助于检测错误信息，但存在依赖传统可读性指数等局限，未来研究应采用纵向设计等方法。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

Conclusion: 研究有助于描绘输入嵌入围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，揭示词频和功能的不同作用，也激励对词汇几何演变如何促进模型训练中特定能力提升的深入研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: 提出OBCache框架解决大语言模型长上下文缓存问题，实验证明其能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型长上下文窗口有内存开销，现有缓存淘汰方法未考虑对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 将缓存淘汰问题转化为层结构剪枝问题，基于OBD理论量化令牌显著性，得出不同情况的闭式分数。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型实验中，用OBCache输出感知分数替代现有启发式分数，能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache框架能增强现有缓存淘汰策略，提升长上下文准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

Conclusion: 模型行为的高度分歧强烈预示着模型规范存在问题，同时给出模型价值优先级模式和差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为因果图，提出CADET因果表示学习框架，解耦仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素，控制混杂因素，在潜在空间干预风格进行反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 因果先验有助于推进可泛化的仇恨言论检测。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Result: 两种采样策略可随计算资源有效扩展且有不同探索动态，LatentRM可实现有效轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 为连续空间的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 工具增强推理因特定领域工具稀缺难以广泛应用，且现有自动创建工具方法存在可扩展性瓶颈。

Conclusion: 提出的系统方法能有效解决现有工具增强推理的问题，提升性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Result: 实验揭示稳定、噪声受限的平衡，简单提醒干预能按理论预测减少分歧。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可理解为可控平衡现象，为研究和缓解上下文漂移提供基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,

remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven
single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability,
standardization, and trustworthy model development.

TL;DR: 针对 Agentic RAG 存在的搜索行为不佳问题，提出 HiPRAG 训练方法，实验证明其能提升搜索效率和准确率，且具良好泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Agentic RAG 中普遍存在的搜索行为不佳问题，以及现有训练方法缺乏细粒度控制的不足。

Method: 引入 Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG) 训练方法，将细粒度、基于知识的过程奖励纳入 RL 训练，分解推理轨迹评估搜索决策必要性，并应用分层奖励函数。

Result: 在 Qwen2.5 和 Llama - 3.2 模型的七个 QA 基准测试中，3B 模型平均准确率 65.4%，7B 模型 67.2%，降低过搜索率至 2.3%，同时降低欠搜索率，且在多种情况下具良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 通过 RL 进行细粒度控制对提高搜索代理推理效率和最优性具有重要意义和潜力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，能生成高度适应任务、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑。

Conclusion: GTD框架在大语言模型智能体协作中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 小语言模型在有严格延迟和计算约束的应用中很重要，但实现高性能有挑战，现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡问题。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在标记级别动态结合策略内和策略外生成，让学生模型先探索自身预测，再基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两对师生大语言模型上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高了准确率。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch是一种实用有效的蒸馏小语言模型的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

Conclusion: ConG有推进弱到强泛化的潜力，为通向AGI提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

Conclusion: A²Search能解决歧义问题并在基准测试间泛化，表明处理歧义对构建更可靠的QA系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

Method: 提出多标准提示（将评估标准合并为单个查询）和领域自适应迁移学习（在图表数据集上微调2B参数模型得到ChartJudge）两种方法。

Conclusion: 细粒度分析为模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡提供见解，实现图表推理任务的可扩展、低成本评估。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur

TL;DR: 大语言模型在社会推理任务中表现不佳，提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，在社会基准测试中提升准确率并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在社会推理任务中存在认知混乱、逻辑不一致等问题，无法区分客观现实和主观信念。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型跟踪实体状态和时间序列，监测推理轨迹并适时干预。

Result: 在三个社会基准测试中准确率显著提升（如Hi - ToM中提升10%），并降低计算成本（最多减少33.8%的token）。

Conclusion: 该机制为大语言模型在社会场景中的部署提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图注需准确和风格一致以传达视觉信息，要开发特定领域图注生成系统。

Method: 采用两阶段管道，阶段1结合上下文过滤、特定类别提示优化和图注候选选择；阶段2用轮廓图进行少样本提示以优化风格。

Result: 特定类别提示优于零样本和通用优化方法，ROUGE - 1召回率提高8.3%，轮廓图风格优化使BLEU和ROUGE得分显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解与作者风格适配能生成科学准确且风格相符的图注。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM智能体在部署到现实世界长期任务时无法从经验学习、持续改进的问题。

Conclusion: MUSE为能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI智能体建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: GRPO训练大语言模型存在模型响应不准确、小规模架构易崩溃等问题，影响性能和稳定性。

Method: 提出ToolExpander框架，包含动态多轮硬采样和自我示例思考两个创新点。前者动态替换难样本并采用指数学习率衰减策略；后者消除KL散度，引入调整的裁剪系数。

Result: ToolExpander显著提升大语言模型尤其是小规模模型的工具使用能力，提高训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander能有效解决GRPO训练大语言模型的问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Result: 在1 - shot场景中，平均AUC比强基线高9.54%，Macro - F1高11.19%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决以往方法问题，提升少样本多标签意图检测性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Result: 实验表明FedDTRE能提高对话模型性能，增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE策略有效，可用于提升对话系统训练效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Conclusion: 推理能提升大语言模型谈判能力，但有成本问题，且不同模型存在多语言推理差异。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Conclusion: LLMs能捕捉当前气候分布，但难以代表长期温度变化的区域和局部表现，评估框架可量化其参数化气候知识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

Result: 少量函数令牌能激活大多数特征，预训练中训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌决定。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假设能解释大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Motivation: 现有因果提取研究和数据集几乎完全忽略反因果声明，存在缺陷。

Method: 通过文献综述表明反因果是因果推理一部分，制定注释指南，用反因果声明扩充Causal News Corpus。

Result: 新数据集的注释者间一致性达到Cohen's κ = 0.74，未用反因果关系训练的模型易误分类，新数据集可缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 新数据集能使transformer有效区分正反因果。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

Method: 在可控环境下，利用在同一1亿字原始语料上训练的好坏模型的相对差异采样语料，放大表现更好模型的信号创建合成语料并与原始训练数据混合。

Conclusion: 使用对比解码生成合成语料与真实数据混合训练是提升大语言模型性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

Motivation: 以往研究未深入探讨ICL中表示和学习两方面的相互作用，作者对此进行研究。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，对每个标签集用不同数量的上下文示例进行ICL。

Result: 学习的发生与标签集质量无关，其效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量影响，标签集相对质量在学习中基本保持。

Conclusion: 揭示了ICL中从示例学习及其表示对ICL性能的独立影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

Motivation: 探索更高效的深度学习模型，挑战现有的深度学习范式和缩放定律。

Method: 将Co$^4$机器与GPT - 2和GPT - BERT在BabyLM挑战基准上进行对比训练和评估。

Result: Co$^4$在两个训练周期内超越训练十个周期的GPT - 2和GPT - BERT，在1000万标记上训练效率大幅提升，在SuperGLUE任务的零样本和微调性能上表现出色。

Conclusion: 有必要重新思考现有的深度学习范式和相关的缩放定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 解决并行扩展LLMs推理能力时因轨迹间冗余导致的计算低效问题。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的判断模型预测答案等价性，结合在线贪婪聚类算法动态剪枝。

Result: 在多个基准测试和推理模型中，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样在多数情况下实现超80%的令牌减少，准确率差距在3个百分点内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理树立新标准，让高性能推理更高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Conclusion: CoMAS是基于大语言模型的智能体自我进化的一种新颖有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: 该框架为随基础模型快速发展持续进化基准测试提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue
architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial
transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs
across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a
major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a
comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods
using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data
comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method
across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including
recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide
reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to
technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance
depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond
benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling
comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues.
We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and
functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node,
and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune
infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work
defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and
establishes a reference resource for the ST community.

Conclusion: 此方法扩展了分子运动的可访问范围，为化学和生物物理学中的构象景观、热力学和动力学研究提供新机会。

Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging
processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional
molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their
femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and
relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep
generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics
by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small
organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative
characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes
that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.
Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system
size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and
captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By
expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing
atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing
conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to
chemistry and biophysics.

Conclusion: QFAMES方法有严格理论保障，在样本复杂度和解决简并性方面优于现有基于子空间的量子光谱分析方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained spectral properties of quantum Hamiltonians, including both
eigenvalues and their multiplicities, provide useful information for
characterizing many-body quantum systems as well as for understanding phenomena
such as topological order. Extracting such information with small additive
error is $\#\textsf{BQP}$-complete in the worst case. In this work, we
introduce QFAMES (Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in
Eigenvalue Spectra), a quantum algorithm that efficiently identifies clusters
of closely spaced dominant eigenvalues and determines their multiplicities
under physically motivated assumptions, which allows us to bypass worst-case
complexity barriers. QFAMES also enables the estimation of observable
expectation values within targeted energy clusters, providing a powerful tool
for studying quantum phase transitions and other physical properties. We
validate the effectiveness of QFAMES through numerical demonstrations,
including its applications to characterizing quantum phases in the
transverse-field Ising model and estimating the ground-state degeneracy of a
topologically ordered phase in the two-dimensional toric code model. Our
approach offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and significant advantages over
existing subspace-based quantum spectral analysis methods, particularly in
terms of the sample complexity and the ability to resolve degeneracies.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian (LH)
problem and the approximation of the Quantum Partition Function (QPF), two
central problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum complexity theory.
Both problems are known to be QMA-hard, and under the widely believed
assumption that $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{QMA}$, no efficient quantum
algorithm exits. The best known quantum algorithm for LH runs in
$O\bigl(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1 - o(1))}\bigr)$ time, while for QPF, the
state-of-the-art algorithm achieves relative error $\delta$ in
$O^\ast\bigl(\frac{1}{\delta}\sqrt{\frac{2^n}{Z}}\bigr)$ time, where $Z$
denotes the value of the partition function. A nature open question is whether
more efficient algorithms exist for both problems.
  In this work, we establish tight conditional lower bounds showing that these
algorithms are nearly optimal. Under the plausible Quantum Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis (QSETH), we prove that no quantum algorithm can solve either LH
or approximate QPF significantly faster than $O(2^{n/2})$, even for 3-local
Hamiltonians. In particular, we show: 1) 3-local LH cannot be solved in time
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH; 2)
3-local QPF cannot be approximated up to any constant relative error in
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ time for any $\varepsilon > 0$ under QSETH;
and 3) we present a quantum algorithm that approximates QPF up to relative
error $1/2 + 1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ in $O^\ast(2^{n/2})$ time, matching our
conditional lower bound.
  Notably, our results provide the first fine-grained lower bounds for both LH
and QPF with fixed locality. This stands in sharp contrast to QSETH and the
trivial fine-grained lower bounds for LH, where the locality of the SAT
instance and the Hamiltonian depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$ in the
$O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ running time.

particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without

  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the

Conclusion: 共轭和转置查询赋予量子算法更多能力，密码原语应证明对这些查询形式的安全性。

Abstract: We give a natural problem over input quantum oracles $U$ which cannot be
solved with exponentially many black-box queries to $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but
which can be solved with constant many queries to $U$ and $U^*$, or $U$ and
$U^{\mathrm{T}}$. We also demonstrate a quantum commitment scheme that is
secure against adversaries that query only $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but is insecure
if the adversary can query $U^*$. These results show that conjugate and
transpose queries do give more power to quantum algorithms, lending credence to
the idea put forth by Zhandry that cryptographic primitives should prove
security against these forms of queries.
  Our key lemma is that any circuit using $q$ forward and inverse queries to a
state preparation unitary for a state $\sigma$ can be simulated to
$\varepsilon$ error with $n = \mathcal{O}(q^2/\varepsilon)$ copies of $\sigma$.
Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) state
preparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access.
These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques;
our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, most
counter-intuitive form. In doing so, we identify a motif where generically
strengthening a quantum resource can be possible if the output is allowed to be
random, bypassing no-go theorems for deterministic algorithms. We call this the
acorn trick.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a
rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error
$\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n =
O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample
complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a
special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography,
in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in
\mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in
our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts
any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in
trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the
more stringent Bures distance.

- referred to as unaddition. To highlight the potential of the approach the
unaddition quantum circuit is employed to construct a device for factoring
integer numbers $N$, which is then called unmultiplier. This approach requires
only a number of qubits $\in \mathcal{O}((\log{N})^2)$, rivalling the best
known factoring algorithms to date.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many
constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a
principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching
problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm
for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls
to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which
we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method.
  Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we
present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution
to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix.
This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for
violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the
quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new
state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the
packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while
sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width
reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query
models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP
solvers.

Abstract: We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the
increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by
decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into
independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants
ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex
Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with
multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse
workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with
Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for
multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by
implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum
reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across
multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying
and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between
incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized
interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization
flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the
continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for
Quantum Computing suite.

Conclusion: 提出的SDP证书层次结构可有效用于局部量子比特哈密顿量谱隙的下界估计。

Abstract: We give a convergent hierarchy of SDP certificates for bounding the spectral
gap of local qubit Hamiltonians from below. Our approach is based on the NPA
hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the
universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well
as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding
representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the
ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and
Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper
bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Mass\'{e}, and Vol\v{c}i\v{c}. The
convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be
frustration-free.
  We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree
and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all
allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power
$\wedge^2(\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest
eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian. We also give an example showing that
for a commuting 1-local Hamiltonian, the hierarchy certifies a nontrivial lower
bound on the spectral gap.

Abstract: Community detection is a foundational problem in data science. Its natural
extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise
interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph
community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known
classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm
is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered
problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized
stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we
prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree
framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth
statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized
version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a
guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work
suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently
robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we
conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence
of these quantum speedups.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across
physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been
made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum
control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world
settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by
this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where
one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single
local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing
time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which
Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of
tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we
prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are
identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these
insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe
tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with
query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical
post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In
particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three
dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the
Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results
demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under
severely constrained experimental access.

Abstract: The complexity of matrix multiplication is a central topic in computer
science. While the focus has traditionally been on exact algorithms, a long
line of literature also considers randomized algorithms, which return an
approximate solution in faster time. In this work, we adopt a unifying
perspective that frames these randomized algorithms in terms of mean
estimation. Using it, we first give refined analyses of classical algorithms
based on random walks by Cohen-Lewis (`99), and based on sketching by Sarl\'os
(`06) and Drineas-Kannan-Mahoney (`06). We then propose an improvement on
Cohen-Lewis that yields a single classical algorithm that is faster than all
the other approaches, if we assume no use of (exact) fast matrix multiplication
as a subroutine. Second, we demonstrate a quantum speedup on top of these
algorithms by using the recent quantum multivariate mean estimation algorithm
by Cornelissen-Hamoudi-Jerbi (`22).

Conclusion: 成功将经典理论的广度和灵活性引入高温量子吉布斯态，连接了量子系统的动态和结构性质。

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum physics is to understand the structural
properties of many-body systems, both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium.
For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural
properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that
mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no
framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution
into strong structural consequences.
  We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the
classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a
natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds,
a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding
Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural
properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual
information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems,
resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key
technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum
dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how
local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.

Abstract: To overcome the bottleneck of classical path planning schemes in solving NP
problems and address the predicament faced by current mainstream quantum path
planning frameworks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this
study attempts to construct a quantum path planning solution based on parallel
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) architecture. Specifically,
the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum
quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously
execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path
energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out
unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate
optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the
calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings
indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states
corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities
can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of
obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is
only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can
still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with
serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can
find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.

Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative
models that progressively transform probability distributions according to
learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process
that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples
from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally
related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous
variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian
can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results
give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples)
for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by
flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem,
plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models,
such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum
algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical
algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results
reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models,
such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected
capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.

Conclusion: SurgiFlowVid是缓解数据不平衡和推进手术视频理解方法的有前景策略。

Abstract: Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling
procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are
often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which
limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with
$SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for
generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach
introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames
and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion
modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions
the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks
or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate
our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action
recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.
Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over
competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to
mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic
filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million
at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack
of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark
proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present
a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino
acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and
drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the
probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor
EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling
to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This
pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized
proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A
qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical
tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized
six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall
inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune
interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound
library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein
conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong
predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs
against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing
promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental
validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale
functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage
drug development for the species.

Abstract: Research into optical spiking neural networks (SNNs) has primarily focused on
spiking devices, networks of excitable lasers or numerical modelling of large
architectures, often overlooking key constraints such as limited optical power,
crosstalk and footprint. We introduce SEPhIA, a photonic-electronic,
multi-tiled SNN architecture emphasizing implementation feasibility and

multi-wavelength sources to achieve effective sub-one-laser-per-spiking neuron
efficiency. We validate SEPhIA at both device and architecture levels by
time-domain co-simulating excitable CMOS-MRR coupled circuits and by devising a
physics-aware, trainable optoelectronic SNN model, with both approaches
utilizing experimentally derived device parameters. The multi-layer
optoelectronic SNN achieves classification accuracies over 90% on a four-class
spike-encoded dataset, closely comparable to software models. A design space
study further quantifies how photonic device parameters impact SNN performance
under constrained signal-to-noise conditions. SEPhIA offers a scalable,

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving
up the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with
distinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a
memory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes
prefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However,
existing hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase.
Current datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that
maximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth
underutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the
decode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving
costs.
  This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting
a less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct
characteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have
larger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed
Decode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared
to modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8%
higher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the
proposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.
  End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware
cost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while
offering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can
reallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43%
lower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.

*Şener Özönder*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 提出可学习性作为相变的通用判据，以二维Ising模型验证有序相可学习性增强，通过两种无监督诊断方法准确恢复临界温度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏解析解决方案和传统模拟失效时，识别相变边界具有挑战性，需寻找通用判据。

Method: 引入含注意力机制的Transformer模型的可学习性作为判据，利用自监督学习和蒙特卡罗生成的二维Ising模型配置。

Result: 有序相对应增强的可学习性，无序相难以学习，两种无监督诊断方法恢复的临界温度与精确值高度一致。

Conclusion: 可学习性可作为数据驱动的相变标记，凝聚态中的长程有序与现代语言模型中结构的出现有深刻相似性。

Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior,
yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic
solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce
learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer
model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic
states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations
of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to
enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured
attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two
unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in
attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with
the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of
phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in
condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

Result: 通过标准指标评估，该技术比现有技术能更准确提取常规日志，尤其在有噪声时。

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

TL;DR: 提出TrajSkill框架，实现从人类演示视频向机器人的跨实体技能转移，实验表明效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类演示视频学习操作技能存在人体与机器人操作器的实体差距问题，现有方法依赖配对数据集或手工奖励，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 将人类运动表示为稀疏光流轨迹，作为与实体无关的运动线索，结合视觉和文本输入，联合合成时间一致的机器人操作视频并转化为可执行动作。

Result: 在模拟数据上，TrajSkill相比最先进方法降低FVD 39.6%、KVD 36.6%，提高跨实体成功率达16.7%；厨房操作任务的真实机器人实验也验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: TrajSkill实现了跨实体的实用人类到机器人技能转移。

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

TL;DR: 提出IntentionVLA框架解决当前VLA模型在复杂交互中无法进行隐式人类意图推理的问题，实验表明其性能显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SOTA的VLA模型因缺乏推理密集型预训练和推理引导操作，无法进行复杂现实交互所需的隐式人类意图推理。

Method: 提出IntentionVLA框架，采用课程训练范式和高效推理机制，利用精心设计的推理数据赋予模型推理和感知能力，在微调阶段用紧凑推理输出作为动作生成的上下文指导。

Result: IntentionVLA显著优于基线，直接指令成功率高18%，意图指令成功率比ECoT高28%，在分布外意图任务上成功率超基线两倍，零样本人机交互成功率达40%。

Conclusion: IntentionVLA是下一代人机交互系统的有前景范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D神经特征场方法有场景特定和无法建模预测不确定性的局限，机器人需全面理解场景并评估感知信息可靠性以执行任务。

Method: 提出UniFField，将RGB - D图像增量集成到基于体素的特征表示中，同时更新不确定性估计。

Result: 能准确评估场景重建和语义特征预测的模型预测误差，在主动目标搜索任务中利用特征预测和不确定性实现稳健决策。

Conclusion: UniFField可结合多特征、预测不确定性，能零样本应用于新环境，有助于机器人在复杂场景中进行稳健决策。

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流的策略存在表示崩溃问题，无法区分相似视觉表示，导致精确操作任务失败。

Method: 提出DM1框架，将分散正则化集成到MeanFlow中，在不同中间嵌入层采用多种分散正则化变体。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，DM1推理速度快20 - 40倍，成功率提高10 - 20个百分点；在真实机器人上验证了从模拟到物理世界的有效迁移。

Conclusion: 这是首次利用表示正则化使基于流的策略在机器人操作中取得强性能，是一种简单而强大的方法。

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于Falcon模型并引入主动风险感知模块的方法能有效提升社交导航性能。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能车辆动态模型需大量系统结构信息，而这些信息常对非设计者不可用，自动驾驶应用在信息稀缺条件下开发车辆模型存在问题。

Method: 提出基于门控循环单元层的轻量级编解码器模型。

Result: 模型在极端动态条件下最大平均相对误差低于2.6%，对噪声输入有良好鲁棒性，输出信号具有物理一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能在信息稀缺条件下有效关联车辆状态，且性能表现良好。

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

Conclusion: GRACE提供了高级指令理解和低级机器人控制之间统一且可解释的接口，通过语义 - 物理接地实现精确和可泛化的操作。

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

Abstract: Data-driven robotic manipulation learning depends on large-scale,
high-quality expert demonstration datasets. However, existing datasets, which
primarily rely on human teleoperated robot collection, are limited in terms of
scalability, trajectory smoothness, and applicability across different robotic
embodiments in real-world environments. In this paper, we present FastUMI-100K,
a large-scale UMI-style multimodal demonstration dataset, designed to overcome
these limitations and meet the growing complexity of real-world manipulation
tasks. Collected by FastUMI, a novel robotic system featuring a modular,
hardware-decoupled mechanical design and an integrated lightweight tracking
system, FastUMI-100K offers a more scalable, flexible, and adaptable solution
to fulfill the diverse requirements of real-world robot demonstration data.
Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories
collected across representative household environments, covering 54 tasks and
hundreds of object types. Our dataset integrates multimodal streams, including
end-effector states, multi-view wrist-mounted fisheye images and textual
annotations. Each trajectory has a length ranging from 120 to 500 frames.
Experimental results demonstrate that FastUMI-100K enables high policy success
rates across various baseline algorithms, confirming its robustness,
adaptability, and real-world applicability for solving complex, dynamic

Conclusion: CURE方法能更准确地进行不确定性估计，比现有方法更有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public

Conclusion: GLUESTICK无需额外训练，与剪枝算法无关，能有效平衡效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Conclusion: DexMan无需手动数据收集和昂贵动作捕捉，可利用真实和合成视频生成技能，能创建大规模多样数据集用于训练通用灵巧操作。

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人领域缺乏互联网规模的多样化任务和环境演示数据，现有数据集依赖手动收集整理。

Method: 利用大语言模型规划器的零样本能力，在模拟中自动生成多样化操作任务的演示，用成功示例微调大语言模型以提升规划能力。

Result: BLAZER显著提高了模拟和真实环境中的零样本操作能力，能处理训练集外的任务，可使大语言模型降规模。

Conclusion: BLAZER框架有效，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

TL;DR: 本文提出局部最大后验采样（LMAPS）框架，为基于优化的方法提供统一概率解释，在多项任务中达最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散后验采样旨在从后验分布采样，但逆问题求解目标是精确重建，基于优化的扩散求解器在此表现佳却缺乏概率基础，需新框架解决。

Method: 提出LMAPS框架，沿扩散轨迹迭代求解局部MAP子问题，开发有概率解释的协方差近似、重定义目标函数及梯度近似等实用算法。

Result: 在图像恢复和科学任务中表现优异，如运动去模糊、JPEG恢复等任务有≥2 dB增益，逆散射基准测试有>1.5 dB改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS框架为基于优化的方法提供统一概率解释，且在多个任务中取得最优性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

Result: SpotDiff在主体保留和可控编辑方面比先前方法更稳健，仅用10k训练样本就有有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: SpotDiff是一种有效的个性化图像生成方法，能解决现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究k - SUM问题与Primal Treewidth SETH之间的关系，以及为一些树宽参数化问题复杂度下界提供更多理论支持。

Method: 通过归约证明，若存在特定的SAT算法，则存在解决k - SUM问题的随机算法。

Result: 证明了若k - SUM难则Primal Treewidth SETH成立，对k - XOR问题有类似结果，可重审树宽参数化问题复杂度下界。

Conclusion: 一些基于SETH的树宽参数化问题复杂度下界，在假设k - SUM或k - XOR假设成立时也成立，增加了这些下界的可信度。

Abstract: We show that if k-SUM is hard, in the sense that the standard algorithm is
essentially optimal, then a variant of the SETH called the Primal Treewidth
SETH is true. Formally: if there is an $\varepsilon>0$ and an algorithm which
solves SAT in time $(2-\varepsilon)^{tw}|\phi|^{O(1)}$, where $tw$ is the width
of a given tree decomposition of the primal graph of the input, then there
exists a randomized algorithm which solves k-SUM in time
$n^{(1-\delta)\frac{k}{2}}$ for some $\delta>0$ and all sufficiently large $k$.
We also establish an analogous result for the k-XOR problem, where integer
addition is replaced by component-wise addition modulo $2$.
  As an application of our reduction we are able to revisit tight lower bounds
on the complexity of several fundamental problems parameterized by treewidth
(Independent Set, Max Cut, $k$-Coloring). Our results imply that these bounds,
which were initially shown under the SETH, also hold if one assumes the k-SUM
or k-XOR Hypotheses, arguably increasing our confidence in their validity.

Conclusion: 明确了带优先约束的哈密顿路径或循环问题在不同图宽参数下的复杂度和可解性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or cycle with
precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We
study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary problems
$\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Path}$ and $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Cycle}$ are in
$\mathsf{FPT}$. In particular, we focus on parameters that describe how many
vertices and edges have to be deleted to become a member of a certain graph
class. We show that the problems are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for such restricted
cases as vertex distance to path and vertex distance to clique. We complement
these results by showing that the problems can be solved in $\mathsf{XP}$ time
for vertex distance to outerplanar and vertex distance to block. Furthermore,
we present some $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms, e.g., for edge distance to block.
Additionally, we prove para-$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness when considered with the
edge clique cover number.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决边缘辅助车载网络资源分配问题，实现更优性能。

Abstract: Timely resource allocation in edge-assisted vehicular networks is essential
for compute-intensive services such as autonomous driving and navigation.
However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource
demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address
these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that
shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes
N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and
modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an
LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines
ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates
contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these
contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework
incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks
into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading.
Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our
method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with
existing baselines.

Result: 通过分析测试平台与现有技术进行统计比较，该方法比现有方法快且准确多个数量级。

Conclusion: 多级方法能以最少资源准确优化不确定下资源密集、高维和复杂的工程问题。

Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision
variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The
state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design
optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or
stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted,
and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be
affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach
is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and
complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A
non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the
combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are
adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the
fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically
compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be
concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 谱算法在非齐次尖峰Wigner矩阵模型中对更广泛方差轮廓可能保持最优，为计算困难性猜想提供证据。

Abstract: Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood
spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive
i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance
profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a
block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm
for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal
strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved
information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions,
match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the
computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for
a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm
cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial
algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness
conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2023). With similar
techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class
of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above
results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance
profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm
might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study
of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than
piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a
matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new
bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative
matrices, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a classical method for recovering
latent variables with useful identifiability properties. For independent
variables, cumulant tensors are diagonal; relaxing independence yields tensors
whose zero structure generalizes diagonality. These models have been the
subject of recent work in non-independent component analysis. We show that
pairwise mean independence answers the question of how much one can relax
independence: it is identifiable, any weaker notion is non-identifiable, and it
contains the models previously studied as special cases. Our results apply to
distributions with the required zero pattern at any cumulant tensor. We propose
an algebraic recovery algorithm based on least-squares optimization over the
orthogonal group. Simulations highlight robustness: enforcing full independence
can harm estimation, while pairwise mean independence enables more stable
recovery. These findings extend the classical ICA framework and provide a
rigorous basis for blind source separation beyond independence.

Result: HOPE在先前讨论的同质设置中实现了更好的遗憾界，首次有效处理两种新的异质设置。实验表明HOPE在各种场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOPE算法具有灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: High-dimensional linear contextual bandit problems remain a significant
challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods typically
consider either the model parameters to be sparse or the eigenvalues of context
covariance matrices to be (approximately) sparse, lacking general applicability
due to the rigidity of conventional reward estimators. To overcome this
limitation, a powerful pointwise estimator is introduced in this work that
adaptively navigates both kinds of sparsity. Based on this pointwise estimator,
a novel algorithm, termed HOPE, is proposed. Theoretical analyses demonstrate
that HOPE not only achieves improved regret bounds in previously discussed
homogeneous settings (i.e., considering only one type of sparsity) but also,
for the first time, efficiently handles two new challenging heterogeneous
settings (i.e., considering a mixture of two types of sparsity), highlighting
its flexibility and generality. Experiments corroborate the superiority of HOPE
over existing methods across various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码模型将fMRI数据的3D体素体积展平为1D向量，去除了空间上下文，丢弃了解剖信息。

Method: 引入NRF框架，将大脑活动表示为连续隐式函数，利用大脑响应的局部平滑性和跨主体对齐特性。

Result: NRF在主体内编码和跨主体适应方面均优于基线模型，大幅减少所需数据量。

Conclusion: NRF是首个超越展平体素的解剖学感知编码模型，能学习从图像到3D空间大脑响应的连续映射。

Abstract: Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to
natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each
voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional
encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel
responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards
anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.
We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI
activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat
vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit
function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI
space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation
decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary
spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the
model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:
(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;
modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data
efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data
across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned
on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both
intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance
while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge,
NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened
voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D
space.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions
from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often
hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to
overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space
syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This
paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language
Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By
generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our
method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also
conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's
efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust
performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming
several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good
accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact,
physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a
frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized
module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is
publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.

*Alice Di Bella,Toni Seibold,Tom Brown,Massimo Tavoni*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 本文分析欧洲工业脱碳同时保持竞争力的路径，认为深度脱碳技术可行，竞争力依赖政策选择。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨欧洲工业部门在保持竞争力的同时实现脱碳的方法。

Method: 使用开源模型PyPSA - Eur，研究关键能源和排放密集型行业，探索两条发展路径，评估成本差距和相关策略。

Result: 深度工业脱碳技术上可行，由电气化引领，竞争力很大程度取决于政策选择，进口绿色中间体可降成本，广泛补贴经济上不可持续。

Conclusion: 有效政策应聚焦支持氨和钢铁精加工等行业，同时维持当前生产水平。

Abstract: This study analyzes how Europe can decarbonize its industrial sector while
remaining competitive. Using the open-source model PyPSA-Eur, it examines key
energy- and emission-intensive industries, including steel, cement, methanol,
ammonia, and high-value chemicals. Two development paths are explored: a
continued decline in industrial activity and a reindustrialization driven by
competitiveness policies. The analysis assesses cost gaps between European
green products and lower-cost imports, and evaluates strategies such as
intra-European relocation, selective imports of green intermediates, and
targeted subsidies. Results show that deep industrial decarbonization is
technically feasible, led by electrification, but competitiveness depends
strongly on policy choices. Imports of green intermediates can lower costs
while preserving jobs and production, whereas broad subsidies are economically
unsustainable. Effective policy should focus support on sectors like ammonia
and steel finishing while maintaining current production levels.

### [417] [Modelling and evaluating travel information during disruptions: An illustrative example from Swedish railways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08254)

  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 引入评估模型，基于历史延误分布、出行信息时间和客流量，对实时列车出行信息的可达性效益进行货币量化。

Result: 实验结果显示个体估值高于参考值，系统层面至少节省23%的延误成本。

Conclusion: 模型有积极效果，未来可在更大规模场景及包含换乘行程方面进一步测试。

Abstract: Accurate and timely travel information is an asset for enhancing passenger
travel experience during normal traffic, and for mitigating the discomforts
during disruptions. With longer and more frequent disruptions as well as
increasing ridership, traffic delays can incur substantial costs for passengers
and other transport stakeholders, e.g., operators and infrastructure managers.
Such costs can, however, be reduced thanks to effective travel information
strategies during traffic disruptions. In this paper, we introduce an
evaluation model to assess the value of travel information under different
scenarios. Focusing on real-time travel information to train passengers,
accessibility benefits are quantified in monetary terms based on historical
delay distributions, timing of travel information (pre/on-trip) and ridership.
Using a case study from the Swedish railways, the model is showcased and
applied to a commuter line in Stockholm. The experimental results indicate
individual valuations that are higher than references and savings at the system
level of at least 23% of the delay costs. Further testing of the model, e.g.,
on larger-scale scenarios, and including transfer trips, is a possible
direction for future works.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文研究随机Kaczmarz（RK）算法在求解含噪声和不一致线性系统时迭代的渐近行为，推导收敛界限并通过数值实验验证理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中常遇到含噪声和不一致的线性系统，但对RK算法在这类系统上的研究有限，需深入了解其在该场景下的表现。

Method: 研究RK迭代在期望下的渐近行为，探索（含噪声）系数矩阵奇异向量的作用并推导收敛界限。

Result: 通过大量数值实验验证了理论结果，展示了算法在现实条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对RK算法在噪声环境下局限性和鲁棒性的理解，为实际应用优化奠定基础。

Abstract: The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm is one of the most computationally and
memory-efficient iterative algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems.
However, practical applications often involve noisy and potentially
inconsistent systems. While the convergence of RK is well understood for
consistent systems, the study of RK on noisy, inconsistent linear systems is
limited. This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of RK iterates in
expectation when solving noisy and inconsistent systems, addressing the
locations of their limit points. We explore the roles of singular vectors of
the (noisy) coefficient matrix and derive bounds on the convergence horizon,
which depend on the noise levels and system characteristics. Finally, we
provide extensive numerical experiments that validate our theoretical findings,
offering practical insights into the algorithm's performance under realistic
conditions. These results establish a deeper understanding of the RK
algorithm's limitations and robustness in noisy environments, paving the way
for optimized applications in real-world scientific and engineering problems.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

TL;DR: 将从时频表示中识别不同信号分量的问题等价转化为图聚类问题，并提出新识别方法，用数值实验说明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找从时频表示中识别不同信号分量的新方法。

Method: 将信号分量识别问题转化为图聚类问题，利用已有的图聚类研究成果。

Result: 提出了许多新的识别信号分量的方法。

Conclusion: 通过图聚类问题可以为信号分量识别提供新思路，且数值实验验证了这些想法。

Abstract: We show that the problem of identifying different signal components from a
time-frequency representation can be equivalently phrased as a graph clustering
problem: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ one aims to identify `clusters', subgraphs
that are strongly connected and have relatively few connections between them.
The graph clustering problem is well studied, we show how these ideas can
suggest (many) new ways to identify signal components. Numerical experiments
illustrate the ideas.
