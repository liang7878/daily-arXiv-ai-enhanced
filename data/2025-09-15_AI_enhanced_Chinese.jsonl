Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written\nsummaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly\nrecorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was\nassessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified\ncategories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,\nredundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a\npercentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or\nomission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,\nomission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced\ninitial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870\npages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).\nQuality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical\nregulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and\nclarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND\ndrafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to\nsubmission-ready quality.

Setchain organizes elements\ninto a sequence of sets, referred to as epochs, so that elements within each\nepoch are unordered. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three distinct\nSetchain algorithms, that leverage an underlying block-based ledger. Vanilla is\na basic implementation that serves as a reference point. Compresschain\naggregates elements into batches, and compresses these batches before appending\nthem as epochs in the ledger. Hashchain converts batches into fixed-length\nhashes which are appended as epochs in the ledger. This requires Hashchain to\nuse a distributed service to obtain the batch contents from its hash. To allow\nlight clients to safely interact with only one server, the proposed algorithms\nmaintain, as part of the Setchain, proofs for the epochs. An epoch-proof is the\nhash of the epoch, cryptographically signed by a server. A client can verify\nthe correctness of an epoch with $f+1$ epoch-proofs (where $f$ is the maximum\nnumber of Byzantine servers assumed).

Our work focuses on the settings of dynamic graphs and dynamic\nparameterized queries, where the underlying graphs evolve over time (updated by\nedge insertions or deletions) and the input query parameters are specified on\nthe fly to fit application needs. Our first contribution is an interesting\nobservation that the SOTA solution, AGP-Static, can be adapted to support\ndynamic parameterized queries; however several challenges remain unresolved.\nFirstly, the query time complexity of AGP-Static is based on an assumption of\nusing an optimal algorithm for subset sampling in its query algorithm.\nUnfortunately, back to that time, such an algorithm did not exist; without such\nan optimal algorithm, an extra $O(\\log^2 n)$ factor is required in the query\ncomplexity, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graphs. Secondly,\nAGP-Static performs poorly on dynamic graphs, taking $O(n\\log n)$ time to\nprocess each update. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm,\nAGP-Static++, which is simpler yet reduces roughly a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$ in\nthe query complexity while preserving the approximation guarantees of\nAGP-Static. However, AGP-Static++ still requires $O(n)$ time to process each\nupdate. To better support dynamic graphs, we further propose AGP-Dynamic, which\nachieves $O(1)$ amortized time per update, significantly improving the\naforementioned $O(n)$ per-update bound, while still preserving the query\ncomplexity and approximation guarantees. Last, our comprehensive experiments\nvalidate the theoretical improvements: compared to the baselines, our algorithm\nachieves speedups of up to $177\\times$ on update time and $10\\times$ on query\nefficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6AGP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6307\u51faAGP - Static\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAGP - Static++\u548cAGP - Dynamic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6848AGP - Static\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u548c\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGP - Static++\u7b97\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u51faAGP - Dynamic\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u644a\u9500\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3aO(1)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe177\u500d\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AGP - Static++\u548cAGP - Dynamic\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AGP - Static\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Application to Fischer-Tropsch (FT) kerosene production demonstrates\nthat cost-minimizing configurations under unconstrained CO2 emissions are\ndominated by the fossil-based autothermal reforming (ATR) route. Imposing\ncarbon emission constraints necessitates the integration of biomass\ngasification and direct air capture coupled with carbon sequestration (DAC-CS),\nresulting in substantially reduced net emissions but higher production costs.\nAt the zero-emission limit, hybrid configurations combining ATR and biomass\ngasification achieve the lowest costs (~2.38 \\$/kg-kerosene), followed closely\nby biomass gasification-only (~2.43 \\$/kg), both of which outperform the\nATR-only pathway with DAC-CS (~2.65 \\$/kg).

Existing AI for\nsoftware engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution\naccuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a\nresource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome\n(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).\nIn this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by\nre-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench\nbenchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's\neffectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it\nintegrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in\na resource-efficient manner.

At the\nsame time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal\nlanguage into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge\nrepresentation - often without explicitly referring to this process as\nautoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely\nindependent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for\nshared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could\naccelerate progress.

In blockchains based on SMR, however, order\nmatters, since different orders could provide their clients with different\nfinancial rewards. Ordered consensus augments the specification of SMR to\ninclude specific guarantees on such order, with a focus on limiting the\ninfluence of Byzantine nodes. Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage. To address this challenge, this\npaper proceeds to extend ordered consensus by requiring it to also support\nequal opportunity, a concrete notion of fairness, widely adopted in social\nsciences. Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,\naccording to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for\na position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have\nan equal chance of landing it.

We\ndescribe two SRO designs based, respectively, on trusted hardware and threshold\nverifiable random functions, and instantiate them in Bercow, a new ordered\nconsensus protocol that, by approximating equal opportunity up to within a\nconfigurable factor, can effectively mitigate well-known ordering attacks in\nSMR-based blockchains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u590d\u5236\uff08SMR\uff09\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u6392\u5e8f\u64cd\u7eb5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u5e8f\u5171\u8bc6\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79d8\u5bc6\u968f\u673a\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff08SRO\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u534f\u8baeBercow\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6392\u5e8f\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eSMR\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u547d\u4ee4\u6392\u5e8f\u5f71\u54cd\u5ba2\u6237\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u64cd\u7eb5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6709\u5e8f\u5171\u8bc6\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SRO\u751f\u6210\u5bb9\u9519\u968f\u673a\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u9608\u503c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e24\u79cdSRO\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Bercow\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdSRO\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Bercow\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "conclusion": "Bercow\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e73\u7b49\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8eSMR\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

However, training\ntransformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost\nassociated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of\nitems. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak\nmemory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length.\nRecognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems\ntypically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss\nwith negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the\nfinal layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model\nperformance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of\nnegative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance,\nbut rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).\n  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient\nimplementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates\ntraining by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10\ntimes. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training,\nit becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item\ncatalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss\nfunctions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related\nhyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these\nfactors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and\nbatch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them.

In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that\nencodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license\nconflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications.\nTo support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine.\nOur study highlights license compliance as a critical governance challenge in\nopen-source AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable\nautomated, AI-aware compliance at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Hugging Face\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u64ce\u68c0\u6d4b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f15\u64ce\u52a9\u529b\u5f00\u6e90AI\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90AI\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u51b2\u7a81\u5b58\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Hugging Face\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u64ce\u7f16\u7801\u8fd1200\u4e2a\u6761\u6b3e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "35.5%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5e94\u7528\u8f6c\u6362\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bb8\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u9650\u5236\u6027\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u64ce\u80fd\u89e3\u51b386.4%\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u662f\u5f00\u6e90AI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6cbb\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u89c4\u3002"}}

To address this, we\npropose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns\nmodality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality\nduring inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature\nextraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the\nalignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the\nclassification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three\nmulti-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal\nmodels. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from\nhigh-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains\nover uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source\nmodalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the\ntarget model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor\ninference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for\nperception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for\ncost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with\nvariable sensor availability).

The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW)\nhas gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less\ncomputationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own\nright, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of\ndimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for\nthe sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on\nquadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,\nnegative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted\nto the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate\nquadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)\nand repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the\nliterature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically\nbenchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho\nestimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on\nUnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large\ndimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final\nrecommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use\nrandomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \\emph{UnifOrtho} in large\ndimensions.

We analyze dense and sparse models under various\nparallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate\ntheir effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior.\nWe further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation\nrecomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that\nperformance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up\nsystems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in\ncommunication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in\nother cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show\nthat certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to\nbandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing\nmicrobatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power\nexcursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training\nperformance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system\ntopology, and model execution.

However, existing LLM-based approaches\noften struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to\nirrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design\nconstraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and\nambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an\nLLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex\nloop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional\nspecification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each\nfunction into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby\nreducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion\nphase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate\nspecifications--especially those not easily identified by verification\ntool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple\ndataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the\nstate-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the\nlimitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising\nfour categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec\nsignificantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of\ngenerated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of\nassertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification. Ablation studies\nfurther reveal that logical deletion is critical for enhancing specification\ncorrectness and relevance, while program slicing contributes significantly to\nspecification completeness.

In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact\ngeneralisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through\nthe lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as\ngraph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure.

DP-CDA\nsynthesizes data in a centralized setting by mixing multiple randomly-selected\nsamples from the same class and injecting carefully calibrated Gaussian noise,\nensuring ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-differential privacy. When deployed in a\ndecentralized or federated setting, where each client holds only a small\npartition of the data, DP-CDA faces new challenges. The limited sample size per\nclient increases the sensitivity of local computations, requiring higher noise\ninjection to maintain the differential privacy guarantee. This, in turn, leads\nto a noticeable degradation in the utility compared to the centralized setting.\nTo mitigate this issue, we integrate the Correlation-Assisted Private\nEstimation (CAPE) protocol into the federated DP-CDA framework and propose CAPE\nAssisted Federated DP-CDA algorithm.

Although Hamiltonian\nlearning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the\nexisting literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of\nmathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures.\n  We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances\nbetween Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to\none of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies\ndistinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The\nsecond, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through\nthermal states at bounded inverse temperatures.\n  We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be\nlearned in both distances with $O(s \\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and\n$O(s^2/\\epsilon)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further\nestablish lower bounds of $\\Omega((s/n)\\log(1/\\epsilon) + s)$ experiments and\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{s}/\\epsilon)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in\nthe number of experiments.\n  As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli\ncoefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $\\epsilon$ in\n$O(s\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ experiments and $O(s/\\epsilon)$ evolution time,\nimproving upon several recent results.\n  The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the\nValiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting\nunique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time\nevolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the\nPauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover\nthe Pauli support itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite\nits advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can\naffect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation.

We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by\nstudying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network\nfor a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each\nedge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires\nmatches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with\nthe minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing\ncombinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate\nthat a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$\nedges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to\n$m+\\Omega(m) = m+\\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a\nlength of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized\nalgorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m +\nO(n^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\log n})$ gates.

Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with\na predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing\nself-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation\nof correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the\nneed for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive\nlifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive\nprocess, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm\nefficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its\ncompleteness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil\nbenchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\\times$\nand 5.8$\\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting\nsystems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic\nequivalence.

Consequently, starting from discrete SAC\n(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,\nwe determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the\nprimary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by\nmerely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as\nDQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic\nframework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an\nm-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard\npolicy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the\nresulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods\ncan guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the\ntabular setting.

Communication becomes a major\nbottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication\noverhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an\naggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates\nfrom the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive\nliterature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local\noptimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is\nless clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove\nnew convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that\ntuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization\nerror and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of\nthe inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate\nshould sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to\nsettings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar\nrole for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate.

Sample-based\nmethods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely\nadopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative\nmodel. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned\nfrom limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade\nperformance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust\nMDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,\nyet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited\nfor real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the\nfirst online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical\nperformance guarantees.

Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed\nSemi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by\nincorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled\ndataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from\nscratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality\npseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation\nmodel fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed\nsemi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate\nthat fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels,\nthereby benefiting imbalanced learning.

It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and\nmulti-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial\ndictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete\nFourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to\nefficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand,\ndictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but\nrequire learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This\nbecomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding\ncoefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary\nscenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the\nnumber of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen\nsamples from the same distribution.

Additionally, the conventional approach of optimizing\nensemble weights within the probability simplex often introduces computational\ninefficiency and scalability challenges, complicating its application to\nlarge-scale problems.

However, accurately predicting key thermophysical\nproperties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the\nlimited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a\ndata-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender\nsystem (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse\nexperimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first,\npre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature\nand pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and\nanions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these\nembeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In\nthis work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity,\nsurface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both\nwithin-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained\nmodels for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models\nfor all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial\nmargin for four of them.

In recent years, many\nonline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn\nconstructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL\nmethods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may\nnot capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization\nleads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce\nConservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL\nalgorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical\ndata, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining\nthe ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a\nquantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return\ndistribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs\noutright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to\nlearn from diverse data sources.

The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to\nmeasure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When\ncompared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for\ntrip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the\nvalidation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM\nmean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and\ndemonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while\nclassical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity\nduration.

These two\nquantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is\nmaximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity.\nWhen applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary\ntest, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit\nalignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette\nscore, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary.

On the other hand, modern generative image\nmodels primarily rely on text encoders to translate semantic concepts into\nvisual representations, even when there is clear evidence that audio can be\nemployed as input as well. Given the previous, in this work, we explore whether\nstate-of-the-art conversational agents can design effective audio encoders to\nreplace the CLIP text encoder from Stable Diffusion 1.5, enabling image\nsynthesis directly from sound. We prompted five publicly available chatbots to\npropose neural architectures to work as these audio encoders, with a set of\nwell-explained shared conditions. Each valid suggested encoder was trained on\nover two million context related audio-image-text observations, and evaluated\non held-out validation and test sets using various metrics, together with a\nqualitative analysis of their generated images. Although almost all chatbots\ngenerated valid model designs, none achieved satisfactory results, indicating\nthat their audio embeddings failed to align reliably with those of the original\ntext encoder.

We introduce CoDiCodec, a novel audio autoencoder that overcomes\nthese limitations by both efficiently encoding global features via summary\nembeddings, and by producing both compressed continuous embeddings at ~ 11 Hz\nand discrete tokens at a rate of 2.38 kbps from the same trained model,\noffering unprecedented flexibility for different downstream generative tasks.\nThis is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel\nFSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the\nsingle consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both\nautoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter\nachieving superior audio quality and faster decoding. CoDiCodec outperforms\nexisting continuous and discrete autoencoders at similar bitrates in terms of\nreconstruction audio quality. Our work enables a unified approach to audio\ncompression, bridging the gap between continuous and discrete generative\nmodelling paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdCoDiCodec\u97f3\u9891\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u97f3\u9891\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u95f4\u9700\u505a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u9650\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08FSQ\uff09\u548cFSQ - dropout\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cCoDiCodec\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CoDiCodec\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item\ndistributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing\nsocial stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the\nreliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth\nhuman responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.\nSpecifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating\n189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128\nquestion-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic\ndimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning\nmodels, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First,\nsynthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and\naccuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform\ncomparably on this task.

Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety\nguarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in\nclearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual\nenvironmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes\nSelf-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy\nlearning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset\nthrough autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human\nteaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision\nboundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,\nfollowed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot\ngenerates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and\nreconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data\ncollection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.\nExtensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that\nSART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely\non human-collected demonstrations.

While three-dimensional PACT systems enable high-resolution\nvolumetric imaging for applications spanning transcranial to breast imaging,\ncurrent implementations require dense transducer arrays and prolonged\nacquisition times, limiting clinical translation.

Pano employs spherical discrete-continuous\nconvolutions to preserve hemispherical sensor geometry, incorporates Helmholtz\nequation constraints to ensure physical consistency and operates\nresolutionindependently across varying sensor configurations. We demonstrate\nthe robustness and efficiency of Pano in reconstructing high-quality images\nfrom both simulated and real experimental data, achieving consistent\nperformance even with significantly reduced transducer counts and limited-angle\nacquisition configurations.

This study introduces a novel\ncomputational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an\nexplainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data\nfrom the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring\ncellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the\ntissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing\nthree key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood\nenrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier\ntrained on these features achieved an accuracy of 0.774 +/- 0.161 for the more\nchallenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and 0.916 +/- 0.118 in the\ntwo-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model\nexplainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization\nof niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the\nclassification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression\nsignatures.

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially.

Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and\nlaborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage\nclassification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation\nassociated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth\nrestriction).\n  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal\ncortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier\nfunctions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling\nand distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be\nacquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.\nFetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low\npower, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa FetalSleepNet \u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7ef5\u7f8a\u80ce\u513f\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u7761\u7720\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u80ce\u513f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ce\u513f\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u83b7\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u89e3\u8bfb\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7761\u7720\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u598a\u5a20\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8111\u6210\u719f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5728 24 \u53ea\u665a\u671f\u598a\u5a20\u80ce\u7f8a\u7684\u9876\u53f6\u76ae\u8d28\u786c\u8111\u819c\u4e0a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u7535\u6781\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u6210\u4eba\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7ef5\u7f8a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u5747\u8861\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u8c31\u5747\u8861\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387 86.6%\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2 F1 \u5206\u6570 62.5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FetalSleepNet \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u80ce\u513f\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u80ce\u513f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We extensively study\ntwo methods, SHAP and VoTE-XAI, by analyzing their interpretations of alerts\ngenerated by an XGBoost model in three different use cases with several 5G\ncommunication attacks. We identify three metrics for assessing explanations:\nsparsity, how concise they are; stability, how consistent they are across\nsamples from the same attack type; and efficiency, how fast an explanation is\ngenerated. As an example, in a 5G network with 92 features, 6 were deemed\nimportant by VoTE-XAI for a Denial of Service (DoS) variant, ICMPFlood, while\nSHAP identified over 20. More importantly, we found a significant divergence\nbetween features selected by SHAP and VoTE-XAI. However, none of the top-ranked\nfeatures selected by SHAP were missed by VoTE-XAI.

Quantization\noffers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation\nmodels are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors\naccumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the\nfirst fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter\narchitecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations\nwith integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and\ninference, we propose $\\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that\nmitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed\nactivation distributions.

We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among\nvisual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,\nwe analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising\ndirections for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528VLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u5f88\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528VLMs\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728VLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, current approaches remain\nvulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and\nadverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that\nintegrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,\nproviding complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we\npresent MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed\nmethod employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into\nSAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong\ngeneralization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating\nauxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM\nSAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We\nevaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,\nwhere MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.
