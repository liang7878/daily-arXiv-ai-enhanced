We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying\nthe popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its\nmultiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was\nrecently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this\nguarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances\nwith additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for\nrestricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025))\nor three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).\n  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving\napproximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial\nallocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of\nenvious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial\nallocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and\nPareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently\nestablished in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate\nthe strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified\nproofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii)\n2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice\nthe number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances.

In this work, we develop an\nEngineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale\nacross diverse software offerings internally.\n  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an\nagent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We\nprovide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it\ncan refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch\nconforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.\n  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,\nthe Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we\nfound that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger\nbut vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness\n(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis\ntools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the\nsolve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of\n42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.\n  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were\nreviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated\nfixes).\n  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes\nfrom engineers' feedback.

In this problem, the goal is to remove some edges\nof an undirected graph with edge weights and edge costs, so as to increase the\nweight of a minimum spanning tree. In the budget minimization version, the goal\nis to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired\nincrease $\\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the\nincrease in cost. Moreover, the same techniques do not seem to apply to the\nbudget version.\n  Our approximation guarantees are motivated by studying the question of\nminimizing the cost of increasing the minimum spanning tree by any amount. We\nshow that in contrast to the budget and profit problems, this version of\ninterdiction is polynomial time-solvable, and we give an efficient algorithm\nfor solving it.

Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms\nboth zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging\nfrom 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemoCoder\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u77e5\u8bc6\u79ef\u7d2f\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemoCoder\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u529f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u4e2d\u592e\u5bfc\u5e08\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76d1\u7763\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMemoCoder\u5728Pass@10\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.1% - 12.1%\uff0c\u5728Pass@50\u4e0a\u63d0\u53471.4% - 14.5%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "MemoCoder\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content.

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics.

Cooperation\nrates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points\ncompared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This\nfinding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost\nof selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about\ncooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the\nlikelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is\nparticularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the\nassumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines\ncompared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher\nfollowing prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in\ncooperative behavior.

However, existing generative model-based OSFL\nmethods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in\nthe healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single\nround of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically\nDistributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a\nmodified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified\nFlow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation\nmethod are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images.

Standard retrieval process prioritized\nrelevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries\nrequiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher\nmodel for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into\nRankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs.

The\nknowledge necessary to generate a specification can often be fragmented across\ndiverse sources (e.g., meeting minutes, emails, and high-level product\ndescriptions), making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper,\nwe report our experience using large language models (LLMs) in an IT consulting\ncompany to automate the requirements specification process. In this company,\nrequirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a\ndocument that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,\napplication, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements\nelicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS\n(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are\nsubsequently compiled into a complete FDS document.

Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is\ncritical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google).

Through a comprehensive\nset of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we\ndemonstrate that the \"Squisher\" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an\napproximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher\ndiagonal while outperforming baseline methods.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales.

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798.

Then, LIGHT designs individual\nintrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational\ntransformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action\npreferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nrepresentative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability\nacross different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e2\u961f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4ec5\u63a5\u6536\u56e2\u961f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLIGHT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u6362\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LIGHT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes\n(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse\nspline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction.

Conventional\ndesign flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are\nlimited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs.

Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be\nmodeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge\nrepresents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,\nthe RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low\nmemory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective\nand efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized\nmethods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,\ni.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one\nhand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and\nwarehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to\nrelease the dispatch overhead in the sample flow.

Reservoir\ncomputing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional\ndeep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly\nstructured and fixed reservoir network.

Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying\nalgorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,\nand struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental\nconditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to\ninconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and\ndata-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language\nmodels (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their\npromise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including\ndifficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,\nfrequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking\nlots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and\nquantification.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,\nthe proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP\nmodels. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with\nensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in\nNWP model outputs.

The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed\napproach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic\nsystemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents\na fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a\ndynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain\nevent logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential\nTime-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through\nthe Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that\nmeasures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This\ncombined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an\nLP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used\nby existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables\nSILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by\ntraditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective\noracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing\nDeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the\nunderlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the\ncommon false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in\ntraditional models.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features.

The motion of the rafts is\nrepresented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as\nthe eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating\ninteractions between clumps of \\emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects\nof Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of\nmass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and\ncontrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and\nSparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a\nphysics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.\nSpecifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB\nvariables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.\nThe SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB\nvariables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects\nof the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in\nconditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising\ncomplexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected\nclumps.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

Time series capture the behavior of many\nlarge-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.\nUsers often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or\nsuperposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and\npatterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when\ncovering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small\nmultiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that\nsummarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into\na set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar\nsubsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a\nvisual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer\nsmall multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar\nsubsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time.

Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies.

In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based\npredictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498\nquantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using\nQiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,\nIBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).\nPerformance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate\nfidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on\nthe trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting\nplatforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids\nextracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it\nas a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making\nprocess and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%\naccuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting\nthe best compilation target.

However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical\nfindings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep\nlearning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed\nclasses. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image\nPre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the\nlatent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space.

These resources,\nunlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification\ntechniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising\nmethod for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is\nchallenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces\na Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the\ncontinuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise\nwith data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium\nextraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's\nability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's\ntolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a\nfew hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm.

We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and\nembed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost\nparameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u5206\u533a\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\uff08PWS\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3cPWS\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u5f31\u51f8PWS\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u5206\u533a\u7684PWS\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u675f\u7ea7\uff08BL\uff09\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0e\u731c\u6d4b-\u68c0\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "BL\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5904\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3cPWS\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u5f31\u51f8PWS\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ec8\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u95ee\u9898\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u51f8QG\u548c\u5f31\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684PWS\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}
