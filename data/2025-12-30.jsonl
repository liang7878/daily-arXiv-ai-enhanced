Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm."}

To solve these problems, we design a pipeline that first converts Form 57 into a JSON schema using a vision language model with sample aggregation, and then performs grouped question answering following the intent of the form layout to reduce ambiguity. In addition, we build an evaluation dataset by aligning scraped news articles with official FRA records and annotating retrievable information.

We construct and analyze a range of deterministic and stochastic team selection strategies, based on recent form, historical statistics, statistical optimization, and multi-criteria decision making. Strategy performance is evaluated based on points, ranks, and payoff under two contest structures Mega and 4x or Nothing.

Recent studies have demonstrated that learned cardinality estimation techniques can surpass traditional methods in accuracy. However, a significant barrier to their adoption in production systems is their tendency to violate fundamental logical principles such as monotonicity. In this paper, we explore how learned models specifically MSCN, a query driven deep learning algorithm can breach monotonicity constraints. To address this, we propose a metric called MonoM, which quantitatively measures how well a cardinality estimator adheres to monotonicity across a given query workload. We also propose a monotonic training framework which includes a workload generator that produces directly comparable queries (one query's predicates are strictly more relaxed than another's, enabling monotonicity inference without actual execution) and a novel regularization term added to the loss function. Experimental results show that our monotonic training algorithm not only enhances monotonicity adherence but also improves cardinality estimation accuracy. This improvement is attributed to the regularization term, which reduces overfitting and improves model generalization."}

CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction.

In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks.

Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $ε$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/ε$."}

We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query.

Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further."}

A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes."}

This yields constructive PSD guarantees over an explicit feasibility region, avoiding reliance on ex-post projection. To regulate conditioning, we develop an analytic eigen floor that targets either a minimum eigenvalue or a desired condition number and, when necessary, repairs PSD violations in closed form while remaining compatible with the squeezing identity. In long-only tangency back tests with transaction costs, atomic-IQ improves out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and delivers a more stable risk profile relative to a broad set of standard covariance estimators."}

While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles."}

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \\citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \\citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization.

KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale.

Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template.

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench."}

Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples. Our approach is validated on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, demonstrating improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and in the efficacy of post-training on video generation models.

However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance in terms of the F1-score, which ranges from 69.36\\% to 82.76\\%. Additionally, SQLHD demonstrates superior performance over LLM Self-Evaluation methods, effectively identifying hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks."}

This explanation, however, does not account for ensembles constructed from intrinsically stable estimators-including smoothing splines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, and other regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods whose variance is already tightly controlled by regularization and spectral shrinkage. This paper develops a general weighting theory for ensemble learning that moves beyond classical variance-reduction arguments. We formalize ensembles as linear operators acting on a hypothesis space and endow the space of weighting sequences with geometric and spectral constraints. Within this framework, we derive a refined bias-variance approximation decomposition showing how non-uniform, structured weights can outperform uniform averaging by reshaping approximation geometry and redistributing spectral complexity, even when variance reduction is negligible. Our main results provide conditions under which structured weighting provably dominates uniform ensembles, and show that optimal weights arise as solutions to constrained quadratic programs. Classical averaging, stacking, and recently proposed Fibonacci-based ensembles appear as special cases of this unified theory, which further accommodates geometric, sub-exponential, and heavy-tailed weighting laws. Overall, the work establishes a principled foundation for structure-driven ensemble learning, explaining why ensembles remain effective for smooth, low-variance base learners and setting the stage for distribution-adaptive and dynamically evolving weighting schemes developed in subsequent work."}

LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697).

We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Matérn Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data."}

Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states.

Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811).

In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization.

Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness.

These equations induce a positive feedback loop in which routing and content specialize together: queries route more strongly to values that are above-average for their error signal, and those values are pulled toward the queries that use them. We show that this coupled specialization behaves like a two-timescale EM procedure: attention weights implement an E-step (soft responsibilities), while values implement an M-step (responsibility-weighted prototype updates), with queries and keys adjusting the hypothesis frame. Through controlled simulations, including a sticky Markov-chain task where we compare a closed-form EM-style update to standard SGD, we demonstrate that the same gradient dynamics that minimize cross-entropy also sculpt the low-dimensional manifolds identified in our companion work as implementing Bayesian inference.

Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening."}

Given a query with a starting bus stop and a set of Points of Interest (POIs) to visit, our goal is to find an optimal route on the bus network that allows the user to visit all specified POIs from the starting stop with minimal travel time, which includes both bus travel time and waiting time at bus stops. Although this problem resembles a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem, it cannot be effectively solved using existing solutions due to the complex nature of bus networks, particularly the constantly changing bus travel times and user waiting times. In this paper, we first propose a modified graph structure to represent the bus network, accommodating the varying bus travel times and their arrival schedules at each stop. Initially, we suggest a brute-force exploration algorithm based on the Dijkstra principle to evaluate all potential routes and determine the best one; however, this approach is too costly for large bus networks. To address this, we introduce the EA-Star algorithm, which focuses on computing the shortest route for promising POI visit sequences. The algorithm includes a terminal condition that halts evaluation once the optimal route is identified, avoiding the need to evaluate all possible POI sequences. During the computation of the shortest route for each POI visiting sequence, it employs the A* algorithm on the modified graph structure, narrowing the search space toward the destination and improving search efficiency. Experiments using New York bus network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Code available at: https://github.com/Rajeeb321123/Latent_sculpting_using_two_stage_method", "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection."}

This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility."}

However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the integrity of search engines and downstream systems. Existing defenses either rely on heuristics with poor generalization or on certified methods that assume overly strong adversarial knowledge, limiting their practical use. To address these challenges, we propose RobustMask, a novel defense that combines the context-prediction capability of pretrained language models with a randomized masking-based smoothing mechanism. Our approach strengthens neural ranking models against adversarial perturbations at the character, word, and phrase levels. Leveraging both the pairwise comparison ability of ranking models and probabilistic statistical analysis, we provide a theoretical proof of RobustMask's certified top-K robustness. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that RobustMask successfully certifies over 20% of candidate documents within the top-10 ranking positions against adversarial perturbations affecting up to 30% of their content. These results highlight the effectiveness of RobustMask in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural ranking models, marking a significant step toward providing stronger security guarantees for real-world retrieval systems."}

However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.\n  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method.

I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies.

Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as \"rolling the dice.\" Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust. These findings open new directions for research on the future of software engineering and point to practical opportunities for tool design and education."}

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors."}

Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints.

We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs.

Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation. We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization.

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process."}

This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively.

We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC).

These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via numerical simulations, showing that the decomposition maintains optimality and guarantees in the original problem. Our methods are also validated in a Gazebo physics simulator, achieving successful capture of quadrotors in three spatial dimensions space for the first time to the best of our knowledge."}

To address this, this work is the first to explore batch processing of multiple R$k$NN queries, aiming to minimize total computation by sharing duplicate calculations across queries. To tackle this issue, we propose the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm, which uses rapid verification and pruning strategies based on geometric constraints, along with an optimized range search technique, to speed up the process of identifying the R$k$NNs for each query. Furthermore, it proposes a dynamic distance caching mechanism to enable computation reuse when handling multiple queries, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary computations.

Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments.

The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure."}

Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems."}

However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively."}

LLMs provide generally reasonable suggestions, but often fail to generate optimal plans that account for detailed user requirements, given the vast number of potential POIs and possible routes based on POI combinations within a real-world road network. In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings. Subsequently, we propose an explore-and-bound paradigm to efficiently process KATR queries by eliminating redundant candidates based on estimated score bounds from global to local levels.

They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets. TL is built on the MLIR ecosystem and defines a generic entry point for different front-ends and an end point for different back-ends."}

In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the \"low-pass filtering\" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures."}

Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art fine-tuned AVR models and the adequacy of match-based evaluation metrics in three ways. First, we apply semantic-preserving transformations to test sets in order to determine whether models truly learn robust vulnerability-repair patterns or simply rely on spurious features. Second, we re-split the training, validation, and test sets to be mutually exclusive and evaluate the models on the revised test set to assess their generalization capabilities.

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight.

Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets.

Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories.

This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation."}

This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.\n  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation. This method is implemented via an iterative application of Stein's method to quadratic tilts of sums of bounded random variables, which may be of independent interest. The resulting analysis provides an operator-norm control of the full correlation structure under arbitrary external fields. Combined with the localization schemes of Eldan and Chen, these estimates lead to a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and near-optimal mixing time bounds in regimes where spectral width bounds fail. As a complementary result, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mixing time for low temperature anti-ferromagnetic Ising models on sparse Erdös-Rényi graphs, based on the existence of gapped states as in the recent work of Sellke."}

CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary.

Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems."}

Moreover, we define the max-reachability query as a generalized form of the s-reachability problem, which aims to find the largest value of s that allows one vertex to reach another. To answer max-reachability queries in hypergraphs, we first analyze limitations of the existing vertex-to-vertex and hyperedge-to-hyperedge indexing techniques. We then introduce the HL-index, a compact vertex-to-hyperedge index tailored for the max-reachability problem. To both efficiently and effectively construct a minimal HL-index, we develop a fast covering relationship detection method to eliminate fruitless hypergraph traversals during index construction. A lightweight neighbor-index is further proposed to avoid repeatedly exploring neighbor relationships in hypergraphs and hence accelerate the construction.

Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments."}

To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters.

Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability."}

To that end, we propose RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation), a pretexting strategy that manipulates LLMs into generating functional exploits despite their safety mechanisms. Testing against Odoo -- a widely used ERP platform, we evaluated five mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek) and achieved a 100% success rate: tested CVE yielded at least one working exploit within 3-4 prompting rounds.

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner.

A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes."}

Recognizing the limitations of index-based methods, which become quickly outdated as travel costs change, our work abandons indexes in favor of incremental network expansion on each snapshot of a dynamic road network to search for kNNs. To enhance expansion efficiency, we present DkNN, a distributed algorithm that divides the road network into sub-networks for parallel exploration using Dijkstra's algorithm across relevant regions.

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments."}

Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs."}

We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.\n  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency."}

To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time.

MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components.

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI."}

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process."}

Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions.

CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.\n  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment."}

To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit.

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model."}

This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior.

In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.\n  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \\emph{frame-precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.\n  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures.

Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.\n  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement.

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods."}

We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set.

This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.\n  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.\n  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study.

Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.\n  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices."}

We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.\n  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining."}

However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact. Together, these findings offer practical insights and concrete guidance for designing more energy-efficient multimodal LLM serving systems."}

In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\\{-1, 1\\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner.

While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.\n  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).\n  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab).

As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, \"PatchNorm\", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation."}

This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs. The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization."}

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.\n  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.\n  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.\n  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms."}

This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying a high-performance, private LLM inference server at a cost accessible to Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises."}

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates."}

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets."}

In large lectures, instructors face challenges on identifying students' knowledge gaps timely, which is critical for effective teaching. Existing classroom response systems rely on instructor-initiated interactions, which limits their ability to capture the spontaneous knowledge gaps that naturally emerge during lectures. With the widespread adoption of LLMs among students, we recognize these student-AI dialogues as a valuable, student-centered data source for identifying knowledge gaps. In this idea paper, we propose QueryQuilt, a multi-agent LLM framework that automatically detects common knowledge gaps in large-scale lectures by analyzing students' chat logs with AI assistants. QueryQuilt consists of two key components: (1) a Dialogue Agent that responds to student questions while employing probing questions to reveal underlying knowledge gaps, and (2) a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to identify knowledge gaps across the student population. By generating frequency distributions of identified gaps, instructors can gain comprehensive insights into class-wide understanding. Our evaluation demonstrates promising results, with QueryQuilt achieving 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps among simulated students and 95% completeness when tested on real student-AI dialogue data. These initial findings indicate the system's potential for facilitate teaching in authentic learning environments. We plan to deploy QueryQuilt in actual classroom settings for comprehensive evaluation, measuring its detection accuracy and impact on instruction."}

This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697).

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments."}

To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits.

The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL."}

For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias.

Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening."}

In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations."}

An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics."}

The unaddressed inherent sparsity in data and models often results in overly dense models and poor generalizability under data and client participation heterogeneity. We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC). We compare the results with a magnitude pruning-based thresholding algorithm for sparsity in FL.

Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration."}

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance."}

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling."}

Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias.

However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale.

Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning."}

While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale."}

Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation.\n  We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected."}

Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior."}

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems."}

While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency.

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data."}

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality.

Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice."}

In distributed systems, interdependent data sources reveal hidden relationships and latent structures, representing valuable information for many applications. This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm designed to uncover higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data. The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism. Experimental results confirm OSM-L's convergence and representation capabilities on structured datasets, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity."}

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings."}

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape."}

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety."}

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness."}

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification."}

However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets."}

Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements."}

Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task."}

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there."}

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine."}

This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms."}

Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively \"untangling\" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware.

MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL."}

In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.\n  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features."}

Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service. Key innovations include a workflow for service instrumentation and evidence that decentralized adaptation can emerge from localized decisions without global coordination. The work bridges autonomic computing theory with cloud-native practice, providing both a conceptual framework and concrete tools for building resilient distributed systems.

Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases."}

While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting."}

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation.

The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.\n  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.\n  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition.

Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning.

Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes.

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate."}

Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility.

With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training.

Our framework measures overhead, isolation quality, LLM-specific performance, memory bandwidth, cache behavior, PCIe throughput, multi-GPU communication, scheduling efficiency, memory fragmentation, and error recovery. GPU-Virt-Bench enables systematic comparison between software virtualization approaches and ideal MIG behavior, providing actionable insights for practitioners deploying GPU resources in multi-tenant environments.

Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also \"help in the wrong way\" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.\n  To address this critical \"safety gap,\" we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.\n  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment."}

We introduce \\Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \\ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \\Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \\ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return.

Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection.

This framework reduces the rates of spurious propagation and convective misplacement by over an order of magnitude compared to the classical index.

In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.\n  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \\emph{frame-precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.\n  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks.

This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair.

We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata.

Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component.

However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods."}

For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents.

The code is available at https://github.com/efficient-learning-lab/TimePerceiver", "summary": "In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments."}

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods."}

Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods."}

This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks."}

Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001).

For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12).

In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization.

Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness.

Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \\emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods."}

In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame.

Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries.

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes."}

By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance.

Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning."}

While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches."}

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices."}

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices."}

We introduce CosineGate, an end-to-end differentiable architecture for dynamic routing in residual networks that uses cosine incompatibility between identity and residual feature representations as a self-supervised skip signal. CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction.

We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images.

Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures.

In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B."}

To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies.

To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum.

We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \\sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \\sum_k b_k \\mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\\{μ_k, λ_k\\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure.

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness."}

The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations.

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process."}

Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5.

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model."}

Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings."}

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.\n  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.\n  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.\n  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms."}

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms."}

To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention."}

To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks.

Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence.

Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent.

Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN), designed to mitigate such gradient-related failure modes and overcome the bottlenecks in function representation. The core of DBAW-PIKAN combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture, based on learnable B-splines, with an adaptive weighting strategy that incorporates a dynamic decay upper bound. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. A series of numerical benchmarks, including the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations, demonstrate the significant advantages of DBAW-PIKAN in enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance."}

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."}

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research."}

We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model.

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers."}

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape."}

By reframing SSM dynamics as Tiled Operator-Space Evolution (TOSE), our method delivers O(1) memory complexity relative to sequence length, yielding a 94% reduction in peak VRAM and a 23x increase in throughput compared to standard Autograd. Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models.

However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets."}

To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios."}

However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions.

Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL."}

Recent studies indicate that LLMs suffer from \"count bias\" and \"selection bias\" in multi-label tasks, yet this has not been rigorously quantified in the domain of code security. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Vulnerability Detection across four major languages: C, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail.

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets."}

Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration."}

Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models.

Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics.

To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing."}

In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees.

However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios.

PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods.

Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.\n  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats.

To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation.

Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query. We identify prevalent inefficiency patterns including missing partition filters and unnecessary full-table scans, and provide deployment guidelines for cost-sensitive enterprise environments."}

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning."}

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation."}

By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint."}

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters."}

In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness."}

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR."}

KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale.

It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data."}

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs."}

We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach."}

Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses.

However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios."}

However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results.

The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities."}

Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases."}

Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others.

A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR).

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment."}

Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice."}

We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness.

We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context."}

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine."}

To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients.

Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude.

We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation."}

In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties.

Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization.

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible.

While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly."}

They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.\n  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.\n  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches.

The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment."}

From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application.

We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization.

The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications.

Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems."}

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining."}

Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance.

Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness."}

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments."}

Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering.

These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained.

Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training.

Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4."}

We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold."}

To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance."}

In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology."}

However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale.

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider.

This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems.

However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging."}

Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition.

Across state-of-the-art agents, we find dark patterns successfully steer agent trajectories towards malicious outcomes in over 70% of tested generated and real-world tasks -- compared to a human average of 31%. Moreover, we find that dark pattern effectiveness correlates positively with model size and test-time reasoning, making larger, more capable models more susceptible. Leading countermeasures against adversarial attacks, including in-context prompting and guardrail models, fail to consistently reduce the success rate of dark pattern interventions. Our findings reveal dark patterns as a latent and unmitigated risk to web agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against manipulative designs."}

This paper highlights similarities among five popular models, latent budget analysis (LBA), latent class analysis (LCA), end-member analysis (EMA), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We focus on an essential issue-identifiability-of these models and prove that the solution of LBA, EMA, LCA, PLSA is unique if and only if the solution of NMF is unique. We also provide a brief review for algorithms of these models.

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \\citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \\citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization. These findings suggest that Fibonacci ensembles form a natural and interpretable design point within the broader theory of ensemble learning."}

In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction.

This explanation, however, does not account for ensembles constructed from intrinsically stable estimators-including smoothing splines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, and other regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods whose variance is already tightly controlled by regularization and spectral shrinkage. This paper develops a general weighting theory for ensemble learning that moves beyond classical variance-reduction arguments. We formalize ensembles as linear operators acting on a hypothesis space and endow the space of weighting sequences with geometric and spectral constraints. Within this framework, we derive a refined bias-variance approximation decomposition showing how non-uniform, structured weights can outperform uniform averaging by reshaping approximation geometry and redistributing spectral complexity, even when variance reduction is negligible. Our main results provide conditions under which structured weighting provably dominates uniform ensembles, and show that optimal weights arise as solutions to constrained quadratic programs. Classical averaging, stacking, and recently proposed Fibonacci-based ensembles appear as special cases of this unified theory, which further accommodates geometric, sub-exponential, and heavy-tailed weighting laws. Overall, the work establishes a principled foundation for structure-driven ensemble learning, explaining why ensembles remain effective for smooth, low-variance base learners and setting the stage for distribution-adaptive and dynamically evolving weighting schemes developed in subsequent work."}

First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms."}

Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated.

Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B."}

To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios.

This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood.

LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space.

Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.\n  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats.

Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics."}

However, their performance is sensitive to the interaction of process and material parameters, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. In this study, we introduce a data-efficient, multi-input, multi-target learning approach that integrates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)-guided experimentation with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) to jointly predict multiple mechanical and manufacturing properties of CFRC-AMs based on different manufacturing parameters. We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p <= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics."}

When $π_{\\text{roll}} \\ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL."}

LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization."}

Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.\n  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.\n  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning."}

Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly."}

These equations induce a positive feedback loop in which routing and content specialize together: queries route more strongly to values that are above-average for their error signal, and those values are pulled toward the queries that use them. We show that this coupled specialization behaves like a two-timescale EM procedure: attention weights implement an E-step (soft responsibilities), while values implement an M-step (responsibility-weighted prototype updates), with queries and keys adjusting the hypothesis frame. Through controlled simulations, including a sticky Markov-chain task where we compare a closed-form EM-style update to standard SGD, we demonstrate that the same gradient dynamics that minimize cross-entropy also sculpt the low-dimensional manifolds identified in our companion work as implementing Bayesian inference. This yields a unified picture in which optimization (gradient flow) gives rise to geometry (Bayesian manifolds), which in turn supports function (in-context probabilistic reasoning)."}

Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements.

To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $ε$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/ε$."}

Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum."}

Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.\n  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\\(\\times\\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines.

To address this, we introduce a framework that enhances the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art score of 68.10% on the ICBHI 2017 dataset, outperforming existing CNN and hybrid baselines. More importantly, it reaches a sensitivity of 68.31%, a crucial improvement for reliable clinical screening. Further analysis using t-SNE and attention maps confirms that the model learns robust, discriminative features rather than memorizing background noise."}

In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA."}

This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility."}

A revised version will appear in the Proceedings of AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of fields. However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts."}

Our model compresses user features via a binary tree into a global root representation, applies a Transformer encoder solely to this root, and decodes per-user uplink and downlink powers through a shared decoder. This design achieves logarithmic depth and linear total complexity, enabling efficient inference across large and variable user sets without retraining or architectural changes. We evaluate our model on the max-min fairness problem in cellfree massive MIMO systems and demonstrate that it achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing inference time compared to full-attention baselines."}

To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity.\n  Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers.\n  These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings."}

Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome."}

While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly."}

Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP)."}

Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration."}

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses.

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates."}

KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale.

Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes."}

To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map.

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency."}

Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs."}

Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners.

In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\\{-1, 1\\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice.

Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy.

To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime.

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains.

We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries. Our findings indicate that coordinated multi-agent learning provides measurable advantages for defending against sophisticated trust manipulation attacks in blockchain IoT environments."}

We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems.

We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL.

In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space.

Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog."}

This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models.

This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.\n  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.\n  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time.

On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics."}

In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures.

However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale.

The unaddressed inherent sparsity in data and models often results in overly dense models and poor generalizability under data and client participation heterogeneity. We propose FL with an L0 constraint on the density of non-zero parameters, achieved through a reparameterization using probabilistic gates and their continuous relaxation: originally proposed for sparsity in centralized machine learning. We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC). We compare the results with a magnitude pruning-based thresholding algorithm for sparsity in FL. Experiments on synthetic data with target density down to rho = 0.05 and publicly available RCV1, MNIST, and EMNIST datasets with target density down to rho = 0.005 demonstrate that our approach is communication-efficient and consistently better in statistical performance."}

We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness.

Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \\textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability.

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec."}

Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH).

A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR).

In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}.

Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets."}

We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data.

The available frameworks like SLSA, SBOM and in toto are majorly used to offer provenance and traceability but do not have the capabilities of actively identifying and removing vulnerabilities in software production. The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines.

We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar.

Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective."}

SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency.

To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead."}

Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice."}

A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon.

Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation."}

Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency."}

Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant.

To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways."}

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects."}

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification."}

While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory."}

We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology.

In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable.

However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse.

Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs."}

Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting."}

Tibshirani"], "title": "Calibrated Multi-Level Quantile Forecasting", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "stat.ME"], "comment": null, "summary": "We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems."}

Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability."}

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks."}
