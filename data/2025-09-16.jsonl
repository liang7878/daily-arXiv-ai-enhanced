Yet, achieving high\nperformance for both reads and writes is challenging due to traditionally\nlimited memory and the pick-any-two-out-of-three tradeoff between memory use,\nread performance, and write performance. Existing state-of-the-art approaches\nlimit memory usage and chose a primary dimension (reads or writes) for which to\noptimize their on-disk structures. They recover performance in the remaining\ndimension by other mechanisms. This approach limits databases' maximum\nperformance in the remaining dimension and their dynamic (online) tunability to\nrespond to changing workloads. We explore a different approach that dynamically\ntrades memory for read or write performance as needed. We present TurtleKV,\nwhich includes a novel unbiased data structure for on-disk storage. It includes\na knob that dynamically increases memory reserved for increasing read or write\nperformance. When evaluated on YCSB, TurtleKV achieves up to 8x the write\nthroughput of industry-leader RocksDB and up to 5x the read throughput while\nincurring similar space amplification. Compared to the state-of-the-art system\nSplinterDB, TurtleKV runs up to 40% better on point queries, up to 6x better on\nrange scans and achieves similar write performance, while incurring 50% less\nspace amplification."}

The standard approach for\nmeasuring the diversity of a set of tuples is to use a distance function\nbetween tuples, which measures the dissimilarity between them, to then\naggregate the pairwise distances of the set into a score (e.g., by using sum or\nmin aggregation). However, as we will point out in this work, the resulting\ndiversity measures may display some unintuitive behavior. Moreover, even in\nvery simple settings, finding a maximally diverse subset of the answers of\nfixed size is, in general, intractable and little is known about approximations\napart from some hand-picked distance-aggregator pairs.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach for computing the diversity of\ntuples based on volume instead of distance. We present a framework for defining\nvolume-based diversity functions and provide several examples of these measures\napplied to relational data. Although query answering of conjunctive queries\n(CQ) under this setting is intractable in general, we show that one can always\ncompute a (1-1/e)-approximation for any volume-based diversity function.\nFurthermore, in terms of combined complexity, we connect the evaluation of CQs\nunder volume-based diversity functions with the ranked enumeration of\nsolutions, finding general conditions under which a (1-1/e)-approximation can\nbe computed in polynomial time."}

However, despite\nsignificant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face\nchallenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve\naccuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically\npartition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By\nprioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates\nmore bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space\nquota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize\ndimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error.\nTo speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first\nquantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized\nvectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive\nenumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical\nmethods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ,\nExtended RabitQ).

The core idea is to approximate the log-likelihood function\nusing Gaussian process (GP) regression in a streamlined Bayesian active\nlearning way. Rather than generating many samples from the posterior GP, we\nonly use its mean and variance function to form the model evidence estimator,\nstopping criterion, and learning function. Specifically, the estimation of\nmodel evidence is first treated as a Bayesian cubature problem, with a GP prior\nassigned over the log-likelihood function. Second, a plug-in estimator for\nmodel evidence is proposed based on the posterior mean function of the GP.\nThird, an upper bound on the expected absolute error between the posterior\nmodel evidence and its plug-in estimator is derived. Building on this result, a\nnovel stopping criterion and learning function are proposed using only the\nposterior mean and standard deviation functions of the GP. Finally, we can\nobtain the model evidence based on the posterior mean function of the\nlog-likelihood function in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation, as well as\nthe samples for the posterior distribution of model parameters as a by-product.\nFour numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of the proposed method compared to several existing approaches. The\nresults show that the method can significantly reduce the number of model\nevaluations and the computational time without compromising accuracy."}

Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of\ncontrol over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent\nwork explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still\ndepend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,\nlimiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design.

We\npropose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima,\nidentified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a\nthreshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key\nmarkers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise.\nCrucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the\ncategory assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical\nmarket responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model\ntrained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these\nsubsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak.\nExperimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period\ndemonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline\nfixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading\nprofitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned\nforecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction."}

Given a directed graph $G$ and integers\n$d$ and $k$, the standard problem asks whether $G$ contains a packing of\nvertex-disjoint cycles, each of length $\\leq d$, covering at least $k$ vertices\nin total. In the multi-agent setting we consider, the vertex set is partitioned\nover several agents who reject a cycle packing as solution if it can be\nmodified into an alternative packing that covers more of their own vertices. A\ncycle packing is called rejection-proof if no agent rejects it and the problem\nasks whether such a packing exists that covers at least $k$ vertices.\n  We exploit the sunflower lemma on a set packing formulation of the problem to\ngive a kernel for this $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem that is polynomial in $k$\nfor all constant values of $d$. We also provide a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)} +\nn^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm based on it and show that this FPT algorithm is\nasymptotically optimal under the ETH. Further, we generalize the problem by\nincluding an additional positive integer $c$ in the input that naturally\ncaptures how much agents can modify a given cycle packing to reject it. For\nevery constant $c$, the resulting problem simplifies from being\n$\\Sigma_2^P$-complete to NP-complete. With a single-exponential algorithm for\nthe setting where $c = 1$, we show this to be strictly easier under the ETH\nthan when $c = 2$. In turn, we show that any $c \\geq 2$ yields a problem that\nis essentially as hard as the original problem with $c$ unbounded.

Modeling the\ngenotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all\ncorrelations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage\nequilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations\nbetween alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium\n-- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks\ndown under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak\nrecombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to\norder $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are\nassumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a\ngeneral equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the\nstandard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant\ndynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a\ngeometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes.\nOur analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant\ndynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or\nfourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks.

Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques\ndetect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step\nin these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the\nexecution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure\nthat stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector\nclocks, namely join and copy, require $\\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number\nof threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large.\n  In this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces\nvector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and\ncopying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of\nentries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori\n$\\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic\nhappens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that\nno other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that tree clocks can be used to compute other partial orders,\nsuch as schedulable-happens-before (SHB) and the standard Mazurkiewicz (MAZ)\npartial order, and thus are a versatile data structure. Our experiments show\nthat just by replacing vector clocks with tree clocks, the computation becomes\nfrom $2.02 \\times$ faster (MAZ) to $2.66 \\times$ (SHB) and $2.97 \\times$ (HB)\non average per benchmark.

Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints\nof edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high\ncomputational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we\npropose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without\nintroducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a\nserver side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain\ninsights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.\nSpecifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model\naggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server\naggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters\nand exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to\nlearn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server\nside, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional\ncomputational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE\nenhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in\nchallenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the\ncomputational resources compared to baseline methods."}

We propose an\nonline algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges,\nand splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation.\nOur approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and\noffers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the\nNetflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55\npercentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within\n15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and\neffectiveness for real world caching systems."}

To address this challenge, an\nasymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method\nand a corresponding fluid estimation technique have been proposed in the\nliterature. In this work, we perform numerical analysis on the convergence of\nKDMC with the fluid estimation. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the\nanalyzed algorithm with the accuracy of an approximate fluid method using the\nkinetic MC method as a reference. In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the\nfluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the\nfluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties\nof hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial\nhypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.\n  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the\nalgorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the\nfirst hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to\nhyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on\ngeneral-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general\nhypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.\n  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision\ntrees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature\nnoise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more\naccurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.\nWe also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,\nshowing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree\ncomplexity is properly controlled."}

Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale\nquantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most\nqubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with\nrecent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the\nquantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which\nplace any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO\nmapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large\ngap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows\nthat HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings\nstill exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for\nearly quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go\nmetric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and\nhighlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum\nadvantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition\ntechniques."}

First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves\nessential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI\nelement trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores\nto discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating\nhigh-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token\nSuppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS\nstructure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments\nshow EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising\nwebpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing\ncomputational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%,\nand inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder."}

We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from\n28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data\nis added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed\nframework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the\nuse of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various\nalgorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding\naccuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to\nreal data."}

To address this\ngap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a\nresearch-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for\ncommon challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates\nEnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and\nroom-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external\nsignals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone\nentity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible\nenvironments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several\nbuilt-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process\nfor building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve\nthis by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for\noptimization control for common problems in the building energy management\nfield. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art\ncontrol algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between\nbuilding managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and\nreplacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.\nWith BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load\nmanagement, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The\nbuilt-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies."}

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort.

This research proposes an innovative approach\nto supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping\ntechnologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new\ninformation into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain\ndisruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial\neffects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our\nresults suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,\nfine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most\nsignificant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of\nretrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts\nretrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on\ncomplex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited\nimprovements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query\nabstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice."}

Plug-and-play token\nreduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens\nin generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,\nscattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when\npaired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To\nbridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf\nmethod that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three\nkey contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular\noptimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an\nattention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)\nexploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to\nminimize overhead.

In response, the\nintersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively\nfalling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of\nresearch. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry\ndistinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of\ninterpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,\ncarefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent\nmethodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of\nthe MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we\nsubstantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's\ninherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global\nunderstanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with\npost-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual\npredictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution\nmethods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and\nword-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome.

Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)\ncontrol is widely recognized as a critical factor influencing Quality of\nExperience (QoE). Recent learning-based ABR methods have attracted increasing\nattention. However, most of them rely on limited network trace sets during\ntraining and overlook the wide-distribution characteristics of real-world\nnetwork conditions, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution\n(OOD) scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SABR, a training\nframework that combines behavior cloning (BC) pretraining with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) fine-tuning. We also introduce benchmarks, ABRBench-3G and\nABRBench-4G+, which provide wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD\ntest sets for assessing robustness to unseen network conditions.

We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion\nConfirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across\nexplicit and implicit conversational contexts.\n  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated\npsychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than\nchallenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled\nharmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\\pm$0.84) and offered safety\ninterventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37\n$\\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.\nPerformance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more\nlikely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions\n(p < .001).

However, these DAE approaches\npresented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the\nbase station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage\nand data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering\nusers' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI\nfeedback models may often need to be retrained.

To solve the above challenging problems, we propose\na novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI\nfeedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback\ntraining with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each\nuser collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully\ndistributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,\nand to accelerate the model training as well.

To address\nthis, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that\nintelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa,\nis a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial\nMulti-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing\nspecialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces\nlearning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network\ndynamics.

To address this, we propose a framework that performs\ntraining in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space\n(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational\nsolutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to\nthose searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover\nrepresentational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with\ncompute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied\nsolutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by\nregressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

In particular, many impediments to IoIT are linked to the\nenergy-efficient deployment of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models\nin embedded devices. Research has been conducted to design energy-efficient\nIoIT platforms, but these papers often focus on centralized systems, in which\nsome central entity processes all the data and coordinates actions. This can be\nproblematic, e.g., serve as bottleneck or lead to security concerns. In a\ndecentralized system, nodes/devices would self-organize and make their own\ndecisions. Therefore, to address such issues, we propose a heterogeneous,\ndecentralized sensing and monitoring IoIT peer-to-peer mesh network system\nmodel. Nodes in the network will coordinate towards several optimization goals:\nreliability, energy efficiency, and latency. The system employs federated\nlearning to train nodes in a distributed manner, metaheuristics to optimize\ntask allocation and routing paths, and multi-objective optimization to balance\nconflicting performance goals."}

These challenges\nare even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class\nIncremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually\nadapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial\ncomputational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work\nintroduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach\nthat addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable\nsolution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,\ncombined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to\nperform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization\nprocess on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time\nwithout requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nconfirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the\nclassifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and\nsustainability.

Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For\nbinary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are\nmodified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is\n$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.\n  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet\nthe bound up to a constant slack.

While the\nNRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency\nbetween genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset\naccessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where\nsmaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from\nthe internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers\na unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance\ncompetition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a\nvaluable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw\ndata and applied sports science."}

GoldenTransformer is built atop\nPyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment\nreproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail\nthe technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through\nseveral example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling\ncontrolled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a\ntransformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable\ntool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in\nreal-world LLM applications."}

However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions\nsuch as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world\napplicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and\nrobust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper\npresents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without\nprior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent\nefficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To\nenhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes\nthe decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of\nmissed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high\nrecall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,\nPrecision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls\nwhile keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per\nsample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances\nthe robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

The techniques developed here are not\nlimited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to\nboundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the\nnatural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical\nrole."}

We\ninvestigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)\nand ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,\nwe tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree\ndays (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and\npreprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,\ncorrelation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near\n1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf\nwater content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random\nForest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at\n585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy\ndeclined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and\nweed interference.

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series\n(financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond\nprospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts\nsoft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability.\nExperiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms\ntraditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in\nrecall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms.\nAblation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal\neconomically intuitive default drivers.

This paper addresses this gap by\nformally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number\nof modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact\nthe creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We\nintroduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the\ninherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments\nwith synthetic system models, we establish an \"analytical matrix\" to measure\nthese concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by\nthe number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly,\nwe demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased\nmodeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement.

To address this gap, we introduce\nEthical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios\ndesigned to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in\ntherapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured\nfields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected\nmodel behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This\nstructure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of\nexplanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in\nscale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task\nframework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By\nreleasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded\nthrough community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI\nsystems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate\ndecisions."}

These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate\nforecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive\ndecision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling\ndiverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources."}

This knowledge is crucial as\nLLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice\nquestion-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12\nmedical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:\nmedgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of\ncorrect answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion\nparameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results\n<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all\nLLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters\nacross various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and\nresearch that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those\nexhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties\nshould utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it."}

Our approach combines\nstate-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking\nand segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for\nrobust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal\nocclusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig\nmonitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset\nfor multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall\naccuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing\nmethods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%\nidentity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular\ndesign suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further\nvalidation across species would be required. The open-source implementation\nprovides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision\npig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous\nanalysis."}

Linear and\nseasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear\ncomponents are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are\nreconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20\ntrain test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE,\nWillmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes\nE1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across\nall subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger\nagreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand\nalone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual\nadequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams\nprovided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE,\nfurther reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach.

We\nintroduce the Mixture of Mixed-Matrices (MMM) model: reorganizing the data in a\nthree-way structure and assuming that the non-continuous variables are\nobservations of underlying latent continuous variables, the model relies on a\nmixture of matrix-variate normal distributions to perform clustering in the\nlatent dimension. The MMM model is thus able to handle continuous, ordinal,\nbinary, nominal and count data and to concurrently model the heterogeneity, the\nassociation among the responses and the temporal dependence structure in a\nparsimonious way and without assuming conditional independence. The inference\nis carried out through an MCMC-EM algorithm, which is detailed. An evaluation\nof the model through synthetic data shows its inference abilities. A real-world\napplication on financial data is presented."}

LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Preprint. Under review", "summary": "When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language\nModels (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities."}
