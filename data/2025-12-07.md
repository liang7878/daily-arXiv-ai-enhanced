### [1] [Solving N-Queen Problem using Las Vegas Algorithm with State Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04139)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回溯法处理大规模N皇后问题时间复杂度高，拉斯维加斯算法有性能波动，需改进算法。

Method: 在标准拉斯维加斯框架基础上，通过迭代剪枝，在随机分配阶段动态消除无效放置。

Result: 传统回溯法随N增大扩展性差，提出的算法能更快速生成有效解。

Conclusion: 该算法在计算成本和解决方案保真度间实现有效权衡，适合资源受限计算环境。

Abstract: The N-Queens problem, placing all N queens in a N x N chessboard where none attack the other, is a classic problem for constraint satisfaction algorithms. While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments.

Method: 基于WikiRAG构建RippleBench - Maker生成多选择问题，构建RippleBench - Bio基准评估方法。

Result: 评估的8种方法在远离待遗忘知识的主题上准确性下降，有不同传播特征。

Conclusion: RippleBench - Maker可测量涟漪效应，发布代码和基准支持后续研究。

Abstract: Targeted interventions on language models, such as unlearning, debiasing, or model editing, are a central method for refining model behavior and keeping knowledge up to date. While these interventions aim to modify specific information within models (e.g., removing virology content), their effects often propagate to related but unintended areas (e.g., allergies); these side-effects are commonly referred to as the ripple effect. In this work, we present RippleBench-Maker, an automatic tool for generating Q&A datasets that allow for the measurement of ripple effects in any model-editing task. RippleBench-Maker builds on a Wikipedia-based RAG pipeline (WikiRAG) to generate multiple-choice questions at varying semantic distances from the target concept (e.g., the knowledge being unlearned). Using this framework, we construct RippleBench-Bio, a benchmark derived from the WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Paper) dataset, a common unlearning benchmark. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods and find that all exhibit non-trivial accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from the unlearned knowledge, each with distinct propagation profiles. To support ongoing research, we release our codebase for on-the-fly ripple evaluation, along with the benchmark, RippleBench-Bio.

Result: AI Patrick在64,267手牌试验中表现盈利。

Conclusion: 扑克AI领域追求解决完美玩法是干扰，应致力于创造掌握人类不完美的AI。

Abstract: For years, the discourse around poker AI has been dominated by the concept of solvers and the pursuit of unexploitable, machine-perfect play. This paper challenges that orthodoxy. It presents Patrick, an AI built on the contrary philosophy: that the path to victory lies not in being unexploitable, but in being maximally exploitative. Patrick's architecture is a purpose-built engine for understanding and attacking the flawed, psychological, and often irrational nature of human opponents. Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于大语言模型的多智能体临床决策支持系统用于继发性头痛诊断，评估其性能，发现结构化多智能体推理可提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 继发性头痛需专业护理，在基层医疗中确定哪些患者需紧急评估具有挑战性，临床医生面临时间有限、信息不完整等问题。

Method: 构建基于编排 - 专家架构的多智能体临床决策支持系统，将诊断分解为七个领域专家智能体，用90个经专家验证的继发性头痛病例评估该系统，并与单LLM基线在两种提示策略下对比，测试五个开源LLM。

Result: 使用GPrompt的编排多智能体系统始终取得最高F1分数，较小模型提升更大。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体推理能提高诊断准确性，为继发性头痛诊断提供透明、符合临床的可解释决策支持方法。

Abstract: Unlike most primary headaches, secondary headaches need specialized care and can have devastating consequences if not treated promptly. Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis.

Result: 有害查询检测的安全相关指标最多提升42%，存在与错误拒绝的权衡问题，暴露架构相关校准偏差，确定自我评估和外部或微调评判何时更有效。

Conclusion: 设计对话医疗助手时应采用平衡患者安全、用户信任和临床实用性的最佳实践。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, yet ensuring their safety and trustworthiness remains a barrier to deployment. Conversational medical assistants must avoid unsafe compliance without over-refusing benign queries. We present an iterative post-deployment alignment framework that applies Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine models against domain-specific safety signals. Using the CARES-18K benchmark for adversarial robustness, we evaluate four LLMs (Llama-3B/8B, Meditron-8B, Mistral-7B) across multiple cycles. Our results show up to 42% improvement in safety-related metrics for harmful query detection, alongside interesting trade-offs against erroneous refusals, thereby exposing architecture-dependent calibration biases. We also perform ablation studies to identify when self-evaluation is reliable and when external or finetuned judges are necessary to maximize performance gains. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting best practices that balance patient safety, user trust, and clinical utility in the design of conversational medical assistants.

Motivation: 人工标注且有明确难度评级的数据集对智能教育系统很重要，但众多嵌入方法使选择合适方法成为挑战。

Method: 提出基于文本难度多样性假设的教育锥体模型，将嵌入评估构建为优化问题，设计特定损失函数得到高效闭式解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实证测试验证了模型在识别与难度标注教育文本最匹配的嵌入空间方面的有效性和速度。

Conclusion: 教育锥体模型能有效且快速地解决嵌入方法选择问题，适用于分析文本难度。

Abstract: Human-annotated datasets with explicit difficulty ratings are essential in intelligent educational systems. Although embedding vector spaces are widely used to represent semantic closeness and are promising for analyzing text difficulty, the abundance of embedding methods creates a challenge in selecting the most suitable method. This study proposes the Educational Cone Model, which is a geometric framework based on the assumption that easier texts are less diverse (focusing on fundamental concepts), whereas harder texts are more diverse. This assumption leads to a cone-shaped distribution in the embedding space regardless of the embedding method used. The model frames the evaluation of embeddings as an optimization problem with the aim of detecting structured difficulty-based patterns. By designing specific loss functions, efficient closed-form solutions are derived that avoid costly computation. Empirical tests on real-world datasets validated the model's effectiveness and speed in identifying the embedding spaces that are best aligned with difficulty-annotated educational texts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and hold growing promise for advancing science, healthcare, and decision-making. Yet their training paradigms remain dominated by affirmation-based inference, akin to \textit{modus ponens}, where accepted premises yield predicted consequents. While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial. Grounded in formal logic, cognitive science, and adversarial training, this training paradigm formalizes a computational analogue of ``denying the antecedent'' as a mechanism for disconfirmation and robustness. By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning.

Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.

Abstract: This paper critiques common patterns in machine ethics for Reinforcement Learning (RL) and argues for a virtue focused alternative. We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks.

Abstract: Benchmarks are the primary tool for assessing progress in artificial intelligence (AI), yet current practice evaluates models on isolated test suites and provides little guidance for reasoning about generality or autonomous self-improvement. Here we introduce a geometric framework in which all psychometric batteries for AI agents are treated as points in a structured moduli space, and agent performance is described by capability functionals over this space. First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space. Third, we introduce a general Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator that subsumes reinforcement learning, self-play, debate and verifier-based fine-tuning as special cases, and we define a self-improvement coefficient $κ$ as the Lie derivative of a capability functional along the induced flow. A variance inequality on the combined noise of generation and verification provides sufficient conditions for $κ> 0$. Our results suggest that progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) is best understood as a flow on moduli of benchmarks, driven by GVU dynamics rather than by scores on individual leaderboards.

Abstract: Finding meaningful and accurate dense rewards is a fundamental task in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) that enables agents to explore environments more efficiently. In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent. This proposal explores several approaches to dealing with these unsolved problems and enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of dense reward construction in different RL applications.

Abstract: The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in enhancing financial decision-making processes. However, SMEs often face significant barriers to implementing AI technologies, including limited resources, technical expertise, and data management capabilities. This paper presents a conceptual model for the adoption of AI in financial decision-making for SMEs. The proposed model addresses key challenges faced by SMEs, including limited resources, technical expertise, and data management capabilities. The model is structured into layers: data sources, data processing and integration, AI model deployment, decision support and automation, and validation and risk management. By implementing AI incrementally, SMEs can optimize financial forecasting, budgeting, investment strategies, and risk management. This paper highlights the importance of data quality and continuous model validation, providing a practical roadmap for SMEs to integrate AI into their financial operations. The study concludes with implications for SMEs adopting AI-driven financial processes and suggests areas for future research in AI applications for SME finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is catalyzing a shift towards autonomous AI Agents capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks. However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems.

Method: 构建P2T框架，包含管道和特定领域语言（DSL），应用于多种策略，提取义务条款转换为规则，用LLM评估下游影响。

Result: AI生成规则在跨度和规则层面指标上与人类基线匹配度高，标注者一致性强，详细结果见附录。

Conclusion: P2T框架有效解决了AI策略指导转换为可执行规则的难题，开源资源便于可重复性评估。

Abstract: AI policy guidance is predominantly written as prose, which practitioners must first convert into executable rules before frameworks can evaluate or enforce them. This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix. We release the codebase, DSL, prompts, and rule sets as open-source resources to enable reproducible evaluation.

Result: DataGovAgent使复杂任务平均任务得分从39.7提升到54.9，调试迭代减少超77.9%。

Conclusion: DataGovAgent能有效提升数据治理自动化性能，解决当前模型问题。

Abstract: Data governance ensures data quality, security, and compliance through policies and standards, a critical foundation for scaling modern AI development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel "reversed-objective" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.

Conclusion: 结合生产经验与实验验证，对重复机制进行理论分析，评估多种解决方案，确定关键参数，给出实用生产方案。

Abstract: The repetition problem, where Large Language Models (LLMs) continuously generate repetitive content without proper termination, poses a critical challenge in production deployments, causing severe performance degradation and system stalling. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation and multiple practical solutions for the repetition problem encountered in real-world batch code interpretation tasks.
  We identify three distinct repetition patterns: (1) business rule generation repetition, (2) method call relationship analysis repetition, and (3) PlantUML diagram syntax generation repetition. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects.
  Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases.
  The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation. Our main contributions include systematic theoretical analysis of repetition mechanisms, comprehensive evaluation of multiple solutions with task-specific applicability mapping, identification of early_stopping as the critical parameter for Beam Search effectiveness, and practical production-ready solutions validated in real deployment environments.

Conclusion: 该研究解决工程团队评估和审查FM任务输出的问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a key concern when creating applications that rely on Foundation models (FMs). Understanding where and how these subtle failures occur in an application relies on evaluation methods known as \textit{evals}. Prior work focuses on defining new eval methods or benchmark datasets for specific tasks. However, neither helps a software team with a task-specific FM application when there is no metric or dataset. The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\% and 90\% accuracy respectively. Our research tackles a growing problem facing engineering teams, how to evaluate and review outputs from FM tasks.

Abstract: We present a comparative study of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for cooperative warehouse robotics. We evaluate QMIX and IPPO on the Robotic Warehouse (RWARE) environment and a custom Unity 3D simulation. Our experiments reveal that QMIX's value decomposition significantly outperforms independent learning approaches (achieving 3.25 mean return vs. 0.38 for advanced IPPO), but requires extensive hyperparameter tuning -- particularly extended epsilon annealing (5M+ steps) for sparse reward discovery. We demonstrate successful deployment in Unity ML-Agents, achieving consistent package delivery after 1M training steps. While MARL shows promise for small-scale deployments (2-4 robots), significant scaling challenges remain. Code and analyses: https://pallman14.github.io/MARL-QMIX-Warehouse-Robots/

Abstract: We introduce a unified mathematical and probabilistic framework for understanding and comparing diverse AI agent strategies. We bridge the gap between high-level agent design concepts, such as ReAct, multi-agent systems, and control flows, and a rigorous mathematical formulation. Our approach frames agentic processes as a chain of probabilities, enabling a detailed analysis of how different strategies manipulate these probabilities to achieve desired outcomes. Our framework provides a common language for discussing the trade-offs inherent in various agent architectures. One of our many key contributions is the introduction of the "Degrees of Freedom" concept, which intuitively differentiates the optimizable levers available for each approach, thereby guiding the selection of appropriate strategies for specific tasks. This work aims to enhance the clarity and precision in designing and evaluating AI agents, offering insights into maximizing the probability of successful actions within complex agentic systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of persona-based multi-agents brainstorming for both diverse topics and subject matter ideation. Prior work has shown that generalized multi-agent collaboration often provides better reasoning than a single agent alone. In this paper, we propose and develop a framework for persona-based agent selection, showing how persona domain curation can improve brainstorming outcomes. Using multiple experimental setups, we evaluate brainstorming outputs across different persona pairings (e.g., Doctor vs VR Engineer) and A2A (agent-to-agent) dynamics (separate, together, separate-then-together). Our results show that (1) persona choice shapes idea domains, (2) collaboration mode shifts diversity of idea generation, and (3) multi-agent persona-driven brainstorming produces idea depth and cross-domain coverage.

Result: 在多任务和跨环境设置的实验中，比现有基线模型有更好的稳定性和泛化性。

Conclusion: BiTAgent框架向开放式具身学习迈进了一步。

Abstract: Building generalist embodied agents requires a unified system that can interpret multimodal goals, model environment dynamics, and execute reliable actions across diverse real-world tasks. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning.

Abstract: Generating academic slides from scientific papers is a challenging multimodal reasoning task that requires both long context understanding and deliberate visual planning. Existing approaches largely reduce it to text only summarization, overlooking the visual component and design intensive nature of slide creation. In this paper we introduce SlideGen, an agentic, modular, and visual in the loop framework for scientific paper to slide generation. SlideGen orchestrates a group of vision language agents that reason collaboratively over the document structure and semantics, producing editable PPTX slides with logical flow and compelling visual presentation. By integrating coordinated outlining, mapping, arrangement, note synthesis, and iterative refinement, our system consistently delivers slides of expert level quality. Across diverse benchmarks and strong baselines, SlideGen outperforms existing methods in visual quality, content faithfulness, and readability, positioning it as the new state of the art in automated slide generation. Our work establishes a foundation for design aware multimodal slide generation, demonstrating how agentic collaboration can bridge understanding and presentation in complex multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GTM可作为开发未来AI代理的基础组件，实现工具增强系统的高效可扩展训练。

Abstract: The integration of external tools is pivotal for empowering Large Language Model (LLM) agents with real-world capabilities. However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability. Our results establish GTM as a foundational component for developing future AI agents, enabling efficient and scalable training of tool-augmented systems.

Abstract: Speech Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer promising solutions to people with severe paralysis unable to communicate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use.

Abstract: Molecules play a crucial role in biomedical research and discovery, particularly in the field of small molecule drug development. Given the rapid advancements in large language models, especially the recent emergence of reasoning models, it is natural to explore how a general-purpose language model can be efficiently adapted for molecular science applications. In this work, we introduce BioMedGPT-Mol, a molecular language model designed to support molecular understanding and generation tasks. By curating and unifying existing public instruction datasets, we have assembled a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality training dataset. The model is then fine-tuned through a meticulously designed multi-task learning framework. On a consolidated benchmark derived from LlaSMol, TOMG-Bench, and MuMOInstruct, BioMedGPT-Mol achieves remarkable performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a general-purpose reasoning model can be effectively and efficiently post-trained into a professional molecular language model through a well-structured multi-task curriculum. Leveraging the power of it, we further explore retrosynthetic planning task, and the performance on RetroBench demonstrates its competitive capability of acting as an end-to-end retrosynthetic planner.

<details>

Motivation: 正交优化器依赖的梯度正交化步骤成本高，如Newton - Schulz收敛需大量矩阵乘法。

Method: 引入加速Newton - Schulz收敛的预处理程序。

Result: 实现Newton - Schulz近似最高2.8倍加速，端到端训练运行时间提升5 - 10%，模型性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法无需超参数调整，可直接替代现有方法，提升训练效率。

Abstract: Orthogonality-based optimizers, such as Muon, have recently shown strong performance across large-scale training and community-driven efficiency challenges. However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement. Our code is publicly available on github.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in various applications, often functioning as autonomous agents that interact with each other in multi-agent systems. While these systems have shown promise in enhancing capabilities and enabling complex tasks, they also pose significant ethical challenges. This position paper outlines a research agenda aimed at ensuring the ethical behavior of multi-agent systems of LLMs (MALMs) from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We identify three key research challenges: (i) developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess ethical behavior at individual, interactional, and systemic levels; (ii) elucidating the internal mechanisms that give rise to emergent behaviors through mechanistic interpretability; and (iii) implementing targeted parameter-efficient alignment techniques to steer MALMs towards ethical behaviors without compromising their performance.

Abstract: Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.

TL;DR: 研究通过两个大规模用户研究探究解释性交互学习（XIL）中顺序效应的影响，发现顺序效应影响有限，不构成XIL方法成功应用的重大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究对XIL中解释性交互可能引发顺序效应提出担忧，但其实验设计和任务与常见XIL用例差异大，为明确顺序效应和解释性交互的相互作用开展研究。

Method: 进行两个大规模用户研究（共713人），模拟常见XIL任务，通过操纵正确和错误解释呈现给参与者的顺序，评估调试会话内和会话间的顺序效应。

Result: 顺序效应仅在调试会话内对用户与模型的一致性（信任的行为衡量）有显著但有限的影响，在会话间无影响；用户反馈质量总体令人满意，顺序效应在两个实验中的影响小且不稳定。

Conclusion: 顺序效应不会对XIL方法的成功应用构成重大问题，研究有助于理解AI中的人为因素。

Abstract: Explanatory Interactive Learning (XIL) is a powerful interactive learning framework designed to enable users to customize and correct AI models by interacting with their explanations. In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches. More broadly, our work contributes to the ongoing efforts for understanding human factors in AI.

Conclusion: ASTRIDE是首个扩展STRIDE并集成VLMs和推理LLM，实现基于AI代理应用的图驱动威胁建模自动化的框架。

Abstract: AI agent-based systems are becoming increasingly integral to modern software architectures, enabling autonomous decision-making, dynamic task execution, and multimodal interactions through large language models (LLMs). However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications.

Abstract: We introduce SIMA 2, a generalist embodied agent that understands and acts in a wide variety of 3D virtual worlds. Built upon a Gemini foundation model, SIMA 2 represents a significant step toward active, goal-directed interaction within an embodied environment. Unlike prior work (e.g., SIMA 1) limited to simple language commands, SIMA 2 acts as an interactive partner, capable of reasoning about high-level goals, conversing with the user, and handling complex instructions given through language and images. Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment. This work validates a path toward creating versatile and continuously learning agents for both virtual and, eventually, physical worlds.

Abstract: In this preprint, we present A collaborative human-AI approach to building an inspectable semantic layer for Agentic AI. AI agents first propose candidate knowledge structures from diverse data sources; domain experts then validate, correct, and extend these structures, with their feedback used to improve subsequent models. Authors show how this process captures tacit institutional knowledge, improves response quality and efficiency, and mitigates institutional amnesia. We argue for a shift from post-hoc explanation to justifiable Agentic AI, where decisions are grounded in explicit, inspectable evidence and reasoning accessible to both experts and non-specialists.

Abstract: Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in biomedical research. However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors.

Result: 这些智能体通常表现出基于行动的欺骗行为，提示缓解只能有限减少欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 消除智能体欺骗行为较难，需要更强的缓解策略确保其安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used as autonomous subordinates that carry out tasks for users. This raises the question of whether they may also engage in deception, similar to how individuals in human organizations lie to superiors to create a good image or avoid punishment. We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files. We further test prompt-based mitigation and find only limited reductions, suggesting that it is difficult to eliminate and highlighting the need for stronger mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of LLM-based agents.

Method: 提出STELLA框架，采用动态语义抽象机制将输入序列解耦，转换为分层语义锚点，用其引导大语言模型对内在动态进行建模。

Conclusion: STELLA框架能够系统挖掘并注入结构化补充信息，有效提升大语言模型在时间序列预测中的性能。

Abstract: Recent adaptations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting often fail to effectively enhance information for raw series, leaving LLM reasoning capabilities underutilized. Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors.

Method: 提出Chameleon框架，采用基于代理的迭代优化机制，根据目标模型实时反馈动态优化图像扰动。

Result: Chameleon在不同缩放因子下攻击成功率达84.5%，远超静态基线攻击的32.1%，还使多步任务决策准确性降低超45%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在缩放漏洞，多尺度一致性检查可作为必要防御机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have become integral to critical applications ranging from autonomous decision-making to automated document processing. As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Consumer Index (ACE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform high-value consumer tasks. ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) (55.2%) and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) (55.1%). Models differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50%. For some requests (such as giving the correct price or providing working links), models are highly prone to hallucination. Overall, ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective for solving complex reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, their capabilities can often be improved by iterating on previously generated solutions. In this context, a reasoning plan for generating and combining a set of solutions can be thought of as an algorithm for reasoning using a probabilistic oracle.
  We introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing such reasoning algorithms. This framework formalizes the principles underlying popular techniques for iterative improvement and answer aggregation, providing a foundation for designing a new generation of more powerful reasoning methods. Unlike approaches for understanding models that rely on architectural specifics, our model is grounded in experimental evidence. As a result, it offers a general perspective that may extend to a wide range of current and future reasoning oracles.

Abstract: Generative models augmented with external tools and update mechanisms (or \textit{agents}) have demonstrated capabilities beyond intelligent prompting of base models. As agent use proliferates, dynamic multi-agent systems have naturally emerged. Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems. We characterize the empirical properties of our proposed tests, including their sensitivity to key hyperparameters, in simulations motivated by a multi-agent system of evolving digital personas. Finally, we demonstrate via natural experiment that our proposed tests detect changes that correlate sensitively, specifically, and significantly with a real exogenous event. As far as we are aware, TDKPS is the first principled framework for monitoring behavioral dynamics in black-box multi-agent systems -- a critical capability as generative agent deployment continues to scale.

Abstract: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) suffers from limited global search ability, slow convergence, and tendency to fall into local optima, restricting its effectiveness in hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a Nonlinear Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm (NAWOA), which integrates strategies such as Good Nodes Set initialization, Leader-Followers Foraging, Dynamic Encircling Prey, Triangular Hunting, and a nonlinear convergence factor to enhance exploration, exploitation, and convergence stability. Experiments on 23 benchmark functions demonstrate NAWOA's superior optimization capability and robustness. Based on this optimizer, an NAWOA-XGBoost model was developed to predict academic potential using data from 495 Computer Science undergraduates at Macao Polytechnic University (2009-2019). Results show that NAWOA-XGBoost outperforms traditional XGBoost and WOA-XGBoost across key metrics, including Accuracy (0.8148), Macro F1 (0.8101), AUC (0.8932), and G-Mean (0.8172), demonstrating strong adaptability on multi-class imbalanced datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力行业竞争加剧，零售公司需吸引最有利可图的客户，但需求数据匿名，无法关联特定客户。

Method: 分析西班牙数百万月度需求数据，利用经济部门和位置信息间接识别客户，用需求与目标的距离定义KPI制定营销策略。

Result: 10万客户被唯一识别，约30万客户可在10人或以下的小集合中识别；与随机吸引新客户相比，1万新客户与目标的距离降低40%。

Conclusion: 结合活动和位置信息是间接识别客户的有力工具，所提营销策略效果良好。

Abstract: The increasing competition in the electric sector is challenging retail companies as they must assign its commercial efforts to attract the most profitable customers. Those are whose energy demand best fit certain target profiles, which usually depend on generation or cost policies. But, even when the demand profile is available, it is in an anonymous way, preventing its association to a particular client. In this paper, we explore a large dataset containing several millions of monthly demand profiles in Spain and use the available information about the associated economic sector and location for an indirect identification of the customers. The distance of the demand profile from the target is used to define a key performance indicator (KPI) which is used as the main driver of the proposed marketing strategy. The combined use of activity and location has been revealed as a powerful tool for indirect identification of customers, as 100,000 customers are uniquely identified, while about 300,000 clients are identifiable in small sets containing 10 or less consumers. To assess the proposed marketing strategy, it has been compared to the random attraction of new clients, showing a reduction of distance from the target of 40% for 10,000 new customers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更高效的二维固体裂纹检测策略。

Method: 将裂纹检测设为逆问题，用遗传优化求解，通过训练两个全纯神经网络确定全纯势来评估模型响应，将遗传搜索分为长程和短程阶段，在短程阶段使用迁移学习。

Result: 在三个基准问题上测试，存在最佳训练轮数；在相同应力场表示精度下，比基于XFEM的方法快7 - 23倍。

Conclusion: 结合遗传优化、全纯神经网络和迁移学习是开发更高效裂纹检测策略的可行途径。

Abstract: A new strategy for detecting cracks in 2D solids based on strain data is introduced. Crack detection is formulated as an inverse problem and solved using genetic optimization. The novelty lies in the evaluation of the model response at each generation. Specifically, the solution to the corresponding plane elasticity problem is expressed via holomorphic potentials, which are determined by training two holomorphic neural networks. As the potentials satisfy equilibrium and traction-free conditions along the crack faces a priori, the training proceeds quickly based solely on boundary information. Training efficiency is further improved by splitting the genetic search into long-range and short-range stages, enabling the use of transfer learning in the latter. The new strategy is tested on three benchmark problems, showing that an optimal number of training epochs exists that provides the best overall performance. A comparison is also made with a popular crack detection approach that uses XFEM to compute the model response. Under the assumption of identical stress-field representation accuracy, the proposed method is found to be between 7 and 23 times faster than the XFEM-based approach. While the strategy is presented here for the simplified case of a single internal crack, generalization is feasible. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that combining genetic optimization with holomorphic neural networks and transfer learning offers a promising avenue for developing crack detection strategies with higher efficiency than those currently available.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据共享管道的节能执行策略奠定基础。

Abstract: Data-sharing pipelines involve a series of stages that apply policy-based data transformations to enable secure and effective data exchange among organizations. Although numerous tools and platforms exist to manage governance and enforcement in these pipelines, energy efficiency in data exchange has received limited attention. This paper introduces a novel method to model and estimate the energy consumption of different execution configurations in data-sharing pipelines. Additionally, this method identifies reuse potential in shared stages across pipelines that hold the key to reducing energy in large data-sharing federations. We validate this method through simulation experiments, revealing promising potential for cross-organizational pipeline optimization and laying a foundation for energy-conscious execution strategies.

Result: 验证节点速度提升10倍、空间减少99%，存档节点存储需求降低三分之二。

Conclusion: 新型状态数据库在非分叉区块链中有显著性能和空间优势。

Abstract: The State Database of a blockchain stores account data and enables authentication. Modern blockchains use fast consensus protocols to avoid forking, improving throughput and finality. However, Ethereum's StateDB was designed for a forking chain that maintains multiple state versions. While newer blockchains adopt Ethereum's standard for DApp compatibility, they do not require multiple state versions, making legacy Ethereum databases inefficient for fast, non-forking blockchains. Moreover, existing StateDB implementations have been built on key-value stores (e.g., LevelDB), which make them less efficient.
  This paper introduces a novel state database that is a native database implementation and maintains Ethereum compatibility while being specialized for non-forking blockchains. Our database delivers ten times speedups and 99% space reductions for validators, and a threefold decrease in storage requirements for archive nodes.

Motivation: 探索现代数据库系统利用Linux io_uring接口进行高效低开销I/O的方法，明确其最大效益场景和有效使用方式。

Method: 在存储受限的缓冲管理器集成io_uring和网络受限的分析工作负载中进行高吞吐量数据洗牌两个用例中评估io_uring，并分析其高级特性对端到端性能的影响。

Result: 明确了底层优化何时能带来系统整体的显著提升以及架构选择对效益的影响，在PostgreSQL的io_uring集成案例中应用准则使性能提升14%。

Conclusion: 得出了使用io_uring设计I/O密集型系统的实用准则，且该准则有效。

Abstract: We study how modern database systems can leverage the Linux io_uring interface for efficient, low-overhead I/O. io_uring is an asynchronous system call batching interface that unifies storage and network operations, addressing limitations of existing Linux I/O interfaces. However, naively replacing traditional I/O interfaces with io_uring does not necessarily yield performance benefits. To demonstrate when io_uring delivers the greatest benefits and how to use it effectively in modern database systems, we evaluate it in two use cases: Integrating io_uring into a storage-bound buffer manager and using it for high-throughput data shuffling in network-bound analytical workloads. We further analyze how advanced io_uring features, such as registered buffers and passthrough I/O, affect end-to-end performance. Our study shows when low-level optimizations translate into tangible system-wide gains and how architectural choices influence these benefits. Building on these insights, we derive practical guidelines for designing I/O-intensive systems using io_uring and validate their effectiveness in a case study of PostgreSQL's recent io_uring integration, where applying our guidelines yields a performance improvement of 14%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理能耗大、云推理有延迟和带宽问题，边缘集群存在性能、能效和设备约束权衡，因此需要新的推理方案。

Method: 采用碳和延迟感知路由策略，对不同提示和批量配置进行能耗和执行时间的实证基准测试，并对比不同提示路由策略。

Result: 批量大小为4提示时可在吞吐量和能源效率间取得平衡，更大批量有GPU内存饱和风险。

Conclusion: 所提出的可持续性大语言模型推理方案能有效平衡推理延迟和碳足迹。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, leading to significant carbon emissions and operational costs. Although training is energy-intensive, the long-term environmental burden arises from inference, amplified by the massive global query volume. Cloud-based inference offers scalability but suffers from latency and bandwidth constraints due to centralized processing and continuous data transfer. Edge clusters instead can mitigate these limitations by enabling localized execution, yet they face trade-offs between performance, energy efficiency, and device constraints. This short paper presents a sustainability-aware LLM inference for edge clusters comprising NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (8GB) and Nvidia Ada 2000 (16GB) devices. It aims to balance inference latency and carbon footprint through carbon- and latency-aware routing strategies, guided by empirical benchmarking of energy consumption and execution time across diverse prompts and batch (i.e., group of prompts) configurations. We compared baseline greedy strategies to carbon-aware and latency-aware strategies in prompt routing to specific hardware based on benchmarking information. Experimental evaluation shows that a batch size of four prompts achieves a trade-off between throughput, energy efficiency, while larger batches risk GPU memory saturation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU软件栈要求开发者提前预判性能瓶颈，但当前大语言模型在这种前瞻性推理上缺乏测试，需填补这一空白。

Method: 创建gpuFLOPBench基准测试，让模型对577个CUDA内核的单双精度浮点运算计数进行预测，结合真实性能分析和执行属性。

Result: 最新的大语言模型在简单内核上能完美分类，但在存在隐式浮点运算时会出现数量级错误。

Conclusion: 现有代码助手存在无法内化硬件特定微代码影响的核心局限，gpuFLOPBench可作为开发严格推理性能的LLM工具的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern GPU software stacks demand developers who can anticipate performance bottlenecks before ever launching a kernel; misjudging floating-point workloads upstream can derail tuning, scheduling, and even hardware procurement. Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to "count without running" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WebAssembly性能和稳定性受启动开销、运行时执行模型和资源可变性等因素影响，需评估其在不同环境下的执行情况。

Method: 使用wasm32 - wasi模块，在浏览器的Web Worker中执行，在边缘和云环境通过HTTP shim传输帧到Wasm运行时，测量冷启动和热启动延迟等指标。

Result: AOT编译和实例预热大幅降低启动延迟；小负载时浏览器因内存数据交换性能有竞争力，大负载时边缘和云节点AOT执行超越浏览器。

Conclusion: 基于WebAssembly的无服务器工作流在不同负载和环境下性能表现不同，AOT编译和实例预热可优化启动性能。

Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that enables portable, sandboxed, and near-native execution across heterogeneous platforms, making it well-suited for serverless workflow execution on browsers, edge nodes, and cloud servers. However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency. For workflows with small payloads, the browser achieves competitive performance owing to fully in-memory data exchanges. In contrast, as payloads grow, the workflow transitions into a compute- and memory-intensive phase where AOT execution on edge and cloud nodes distinctly surpasses browser performance.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified the demand for efficient and responsive services. To address this demand, fog and edge computing have emerged as distributed paradigms that bring computational resources closer to end users, reducing latency, bandwidth limitations, and energy consumption. However, these paradigms present challenges in resource management due to resource constraints, computational heterogeneity, dynamic workloads, and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art resource management strategies in microservices-based fog and edge computing, focusing on energy-efficient solutions. We systematically review and classify more than 136 studies (2020-2024) into five key subdomains: service placement, resource provisioning, task scheduling and offloading, resource allocation, and instance selection. Our categorization is based on optimization techniques, targeted objectives, and the strengths and limitations of each approach. In addition, we examine existing surveys and identify unresolved challenges and gaps in the literature. By highlighting the lack of synergy among fundamental resource management components, we outline promising research directions leveraging AI-driven optimization, quantum computing, and serverless computing. This survey serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners by providing a unified and energy-aware perspective on resource management in microservices-based fog and edge computing, paving the way for more integrated, efficient, and sustainable future solutions.

Motivation: 实时系统需要低延迟消息传递，随着计算规模增长，需能跨集群传输消息并高效交付给消费者的强大消息系统。

Result: 系统成功部署到数十个生产集群，可容纳数千消费者，集群内消费者流量达Tbps规模，能在几秒甚至亚秒级（p99）内跨全球交付消息。

Conclusion: Fast ACS能以低资源成本实现低延迟消息交付，满足大规模实时系统需求。

Abstract: Low-latency message delivery is crucial for real-time systems. Data originating from a producer must be delivered to consumers, potentially distributed in clusters across metropolitan and continental boundaries. With the growing scale of computing, there can be several thousand consumers of the data. Such systems require a robust messaging system capable of transmitting messages containing data across clusters and efficiently delivering them to consumers. The system must offer guarantees like ordering and at-least-once delivery while avoiding overload on consumers, allowing them to consume messages at their own pace.
  This paper presents the design of Fast ACS (an abbreviation for Ads Copy Service), a file-based ordered message delivery system that leverages a combination of two-sided (inter-cluster) and one-sided (intra-cluster) communication primitives - namely, Remote Procedure Call and Remote Memory Access, respectively - to deliver messages. The system has been successfully deployed to dozens of production clusters and scales to accommodate several thousand consumers within each cluster, which amounts to Tbps-scale intra-cluster consumer traffic at peak. Notably, Fast ACS delivers messages to consumers across the globe within a few seconds or even sub-seconds (p99) based on the message volume and consumer scale, at a low resource cost.

Result: tritonBLAS达到自动调优方案超95%性能，且调优时间降为零。

Conclusion: tritonBLAS可在生产HPC和ML工作负载中替代经验调优。

Abstract: We present tritonBLAS, a fast and deterministic analytical model that uses architectural parameters like the cache hierarchy, and relative code and data placement to generate performant GPU GEMM kernels. tritonBLAS explicitly models the relationship between architectural topology, matrix shapes, and algorithmic blocking behavior to predict near-optimal configurations without runtime autotuning. Based on this model, we developed and implemented a lightweight GEMM framework entirely within Triton. We evaluate the performance of tritonBLAS across a diverse set of GEMM problem sizes on modern GPUs. tritonBLAS achieves over 95% of the performance of autotuning solutions, while reducing autotuning time to zero. This makes tritonBLAS a practical drop-in replacement for empirical tuning in production HPC and ML workloads.

Conclusion: Aurora能提供吞吐量、低延迟和高带宽，支持应用扩展，带来新能力，推动科学突破。

Abstract: The Aurora supercomputer, which was deployed at Argonne National Laboratory in 2024, is currently one of three Exascale machines in the world on the Top500 list. The Aurora system is composed of over ten thousand nodes each of which contains six Intel Data Center Max Series GPUs, Intel's first data center-focused discrete GPU, and two Intel Xeon Max Series CPUs, Intel's first Xeon processor to contain HBM memory. To achieve Exascale performance the system utilizes the HPE Slingshot high-performance fabric interconnect to connect the nodes. Aurora is currently the largest deployment of the Slingshot fabric to date with nearly 85,000 Cassini NICs and 5,600 Rosetta switches connected in a dragonfly topology. The combination of the Intel powered nodes and the Slingshot network enabled Aurora to become the second fastest system on the Top500 list in June of 2024 and the fastest system on the HPL MxP benchmark. The system is one of the most powerful systems in the world dedicated to AI and HPC simulations for open science. This paper presents details of the Aurora system design with a particular focus on the network fabric and the approach taken to validating it. The performance of the systems is demonstrated through the presentation of the results of MPI benchmarks as well as performance benchmarks including HPL, HPL-MxP, Graph500, and HPCG run on a large fraction of the system. Additionally results are presented for a diverse set of applications including HACC, AMR-Wind, LAMMPS, and FMM demonstrating that Aurora provides the throughput, latency, and bandwidth across system needed to allow applications to perform and scale to large node counts and providing new levels of capability and enabling breakthrough science.

Result: 对C++和Python的VLCs原型进行实验，在包含OpenMP、OpenBLAS和LibTorch应用的基准测试中，VLCs可实现最高2.85倍加速。

Conclusion: VLCs能够有效解决库并发使用的问题，提高性能。

Abstract: As the complexity and scale of modern parallel machines continue to grow, programmers increasingly rely on composition of software libraries to encapsulate and exploit parallelism. However, many libraries are not designed with composition in mind and assume they have exclusive access to all resources. Using such libraries concurrently can result in contention and degraded performance. Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.
  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.
  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs. Experiments show VLCs enable a speedup up to 2.85x on benchmarks including applications using OpenMP, OpenBLAS, and LibTorch.

Abstract: In sparse LU factorization, nonzero elements after symbolic factorization tend to distribute in diagonal and right-bottom region of sparse matrices. However, regular 2D blocking on this non-uniform distribution structure may lead to workload imbalance across blocks. Besides, existing matrix features fail to guide us effectively in blocking. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware irregular blocking method for numerical factorization. A novel diagonal block-based feature is introduced to effectively characterize the local nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose an irregular blocking method that adjusts block sizes according to the local distribution of nonzeros. The strategy utilizes fine-grained blocks in dense regions and coarse-grained blocks in sparse regions, adequately balancing the nonzeros of blocks both within the same level and across levels in the dependency tree. Experiments demonstrate that, on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, our proposed irregular blocking method achieves average speedups of 1.50x and 3.32x over PanguLU and the latest SuperLU_DIST, respectively. In addition, it achieves speedups of 1.40x and 3.84x over PanguLU and SuperLU_DIST on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Motivation: 现有操作卸载机制无法利用不同CXL协议模型的权衡，需解决数据移动成本和加速性能。

Method: 研究不同CXL协议权衡影响，提出异步回传协议，设计KAI系统实现异步数据移动和轻量级流水线。

Result: KAI最多减少50.4%端到端运行时间，CCM和主机空闲时间分别平均减少22.11倍和3.85倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效优化CXL计算内存性能，减少运行时间和空闲时间。

Abstract: CXL-based Computational Memory (CCM) enables near-memory processing within expanded remote memory, presenting opportunities to address data movement costs associated with disaggregated memory systems and to accelerate overall performance. However, existing operation offloading mechanisms are not capable of leveraging the trade-offs of different models based on different CXL protocols. This work first examines these tradeoffs and demonstrates their impact on end-to-end performance and system efficiency for workloads with diverse data and processing requirements. We propose a novel 'Asynchronous Back-Streaming' protocol by carefully layering data and control transfer operations on top of the underlying CXL protocols. We design KAI, a system that realizes the asynchronous back-streaming model that supports asynchronous data movement and lightweight pipelining in host-CCM interactions. Overall, KAI reduces end-to-end runtime by up to 50.4%, and CCM and host idle times by average 22.11x and 3.85x, respectively.

Result: 发现多样性陷阱，确定带宽限制，提出SNR加权聚合策略可在高斜视情况下恢复收敛。

Conclusion: 数值结果验证了所讨论物理层参数对太赫兹 - 联邦学习系统性能的预期影响。

Abstract: The convergence of Terahertz (THz) communications and Federated Learning (FL) promises ultra-fast distributed learning, yet the impact of realistic wideband impairments on optimization dynamics remains theoretically uncharacterized. This paper bridges this gap by developing a multicarrier stochastic framework that explicitly couples local gradient updates with frequency-selective THz effects, including beam squint, molecular absorption, and jitter. Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails. Numerical results validate the expected impact of the discussed physical layer parameters' on performance of THz-FL systems.

### [64] [Improved Time-Space Tradeoffs for 3SUM-Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04258)
*Itai Dinur,Alexander Golovnev*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文利用3SUM - Indexing结构，给出更好时空权衡$TS = n^{2.5}$，并扩展到相关问题，改进已知权衡，方法是对Fiat - Naor算法新应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: [GGHPV20]提出能否利用3SUM - Indexing结构改进已有算法的问题，本文对此进行研究。

Method: 通过将待求逆函数分解为有特定属性的“子函数”，采用[GGPS23]对Fiat - Naor算法的改进，以不同方式将其应用于3SUM - Indexing。

Result: 得到3SUM - Indexing更好时空权衡$TS = n^{2.5}$，扩展到$k$SUM - Indexing、$k$XOR - Indexing问题，改进Gapped String Indexing和Jumbled Indexing问题的时空权衡。

Conclusion: 本文技术可能对Fiat - Naor算法的更多依赖应用的优化有用。

Abstract: 3SUM-Indexing is a preprocessing variant of the 3SUM problem that has recently received a lot of attention. The best known time-space tradeoff for the problem is $T S^3 = n^{6}$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $n$ is the number of input integers, $S$ is the length of the preprocessed data structure, and $T$ is the running time of the query algorithm. This tradeoff was achieved in [KP19, GGHPV20] using the Fiat-Naor generic algorithm for Function Inversion. Consequently, [GGHPV20] asked whether this algorithm can be improved by leveraging the structure of 3SUM-Indexing.
  In this paper, we exploit the structure of 3SUM-Indexing to give a time-space tradeoff of $T S = n^{2.5}$, which is better than the best known one in the range $n^{3/2} \ll S \ll n^{7/4}$. We further extend this improvement to the $k$SUM-Indexing problem-a generalization of 3SUM-Indexing-and to the related $k$XOR-Indexing problem, where addition is replaced with XOR. Additionally, we improve the best known time-space tradeoffs for the Gapped String Indexing and Jumbled Indexing problems, which are well-known data structure problems related to 3SUM-Indexing.
  Our improvement comes from an alternative way to apply the Fiat-Naor algorithm to 3SUM-Indexing. Specifically, we exploit the structure of the function to be inverted by decomposing it into "sub-functions" with certain properties. This allows us to apply an improvement to the Fiat-Naor algorithm (which is not directly applicable to 3SUM-Indexing), obtained in [GGPS23] in a much larger range of parameters. We believe that our techniques may be useful in additional application-dependent optimizations of the Fiat-Naor algorithm.

Abstract: Graphs provide a natural way to represent data by encoding information about objects and the relationships between them. With the ever-increasing amount of data collected and generated, locating specific patterns of relationships between objects in a graph is often required. Given a larger graph and a smaller graph, one may wish to identify instances of the smaller query graph in the larger target graph. This task is called subgraph identification or matching. Subgraph matching is helpful in areas such as bioinformatics, binary analysis, pattern recognition, and computer vision. In these applications, datasets frequently contain noise and errors, thus exact subgraph matching algorithms do not apply. In this paper we introduce a new customizable algorithm for inexact subgraph matching. Our algorithm utilizes node and edge attributes which are often present in real-world datasets to narrow down the search space. The algorithm is flexible in the type of subgraph matching it can perform and the types of datasets it can process by its use of a modifiable graph edit distance cost function for pairing nodes. We show its effectiveness on family trees graphs and control-flow graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合近似算法与固定参数可处理性（FPT）的最新进展，研究以k为参数的最小范数k - 聚类问题的FPT时间近似算法。

Method: 通过LP舍入计算使用O(k log n / ε)个设施S的(1 + ε)近似解，基于解S采样一些客户代表R，从S ∪ R中猜测一些枢轴和枢轴的半径信息，利用猜测结果求解问题。

Result: 有容量设置下，对一般范数有容量k - 聚类问题给出(3 + ε)近似；无容量设置下，对top - cn范数k - 聚类问题给出多种近似结果，还可改进(k - 中心，k - 中位数)问题的双准则近似。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一框架有望在k - 聚类问题上产生更多结果。

Abstract: Following recent advances in combining approximation algorithms with fixed-parameter tractability (FPT), we study FPT-time approximation algorithms for minimum-norm $k$-clustering problems, parameterized by the number $k$ of open facilities.
  For the capacitated setting, we give a tight $(3+ε)$-approximation for the general-norm capacitated $k$-clustering problem in FPT-time parameterized by $k$ and $ε$. Prior to our work, such a result was only known for the capacitated $k$-median problem [CL, ICALP, 2019]. As a special case, our result yields an FPT-time $3$-approximation for capacitated $k$-center. The problem has not been studied in the FPT-time setting, with the previous best known polynomial-time approximation ratio being 9 [ABCG, MP, 2015].
  In the uncapacitated setting, we consider the $top$-$cn$ norm $k$-clustering problem, where the goal of the problem is to minimize the $top$-$cn$ norm of the connection distance vector. Our main result is a tight $\big(1 + \frac 2{ec} + ε\big)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with $c \in \big(\frac1e, 1\big]$. (For the case $c \leq \frac1e$, there is a simple tight $(3+ε)$-approximation.) Our framework can be easily extended to give a tight $\left(3, 1+\frac2e + ε\right)$-bicriteria approximation for the ($k$-center, $k$-median) problem in FPT time, improving the previous best polynomial-time $(4, 8)$ guarantee [AB, WAOA, 2017].
  All results are based on a unified framework: computing a $(1+ε)$-approximate solution using $O\left(\frac{k\log n}ε\right)$ facilities $S$ via LP rounding, sampling a few client representatives $R$ based on the solution $S$, guessing a few pivots from $S \cup R$ and some radius information on the pivots, and solving the problem using the guesses. We believe this framework can lead to further results on $k$-clustering problems.

Conclusion: 所提策略可有效应对强化学习在关键基础设施防御中因学习动态带来的漏洞。

Abstract: The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear influence network model. To overcome the structural limitations of prior methods, we propose and apply neuro-dynamic programming. Our experimental results demonstrate that the omniscient attacker can significantly outperform a naive defender, highlighting the critical vulnerability introduced by the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Motivation: 研究个性化如何在多个评估维度上影响学生咨询系统的性能。

Method: 用十二个咨询问题对比十种个性化和非个性化系统配置，用线性混合效应模型分析词汇、语义和接地性指标。

Result: 个性化能提升推理质量和接地性，但对语义相似度有负面影响，是现有指标的局限；全集成个性化配置总体收益最高。

Conclusion: 个性化带来指标依赖的变化而非统一提升，为代理AI个性化提供更透明和稳健的方法基础。

Abstract: AIVisor, an agentic retrieval-augmented LLM for student advising, was used to examine how personalization affects system performance across multiple evaluation dimensions. Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics. Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses. The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics. Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in artificial intelligence, supporting a wide range of applications beyond traditional natural language processing, including urban systems and tourist recommendations. However, their tendency to hallucinate and their limitations in spatial retrieval and reasoning are well known, pointing to the need for novel solutions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising way to enhance LLMs with accurate, domain-specific, and timely information. Spatial RAG extends this approach to tasks involving geographic understanding. In this work, we introduce WalkRAG, a spatial RAG-based framework with a conversational interface for recommending walkable urban itineraries. Users can request routes that meet specific spatial constraints and preferences while interactively retrieving information about the path and points of interest (POIs) along the way. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of combining information retrieval, spatial reasoning, and LLMs to support urban discovery.

Result: 所提方法在防止敏感数据传输到第三方服务的同时，保留了生成查询的质量。

Conclusion: 所提隐私感知的查询生成方法有效可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to query knowledge graphs (KGs) due to their strong semantic understanding and extrapolation capabilities compared to traditional approaches. However, these methods cannot be applied when the KG contains sensitive data and the user lacks the resources to deploy a local generative LLM. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-aware query generation approach for KGs. Our method identifies sensitive information in the graph based on its structure and omits such values before requesting the LLM to translate natural language questions into Cypher queries. Experimental results show that our approach preserves the quality of the generated queries while preventing sensitive data from being transmitted to third-party services.

Result: CLIP嵌入的余弦相似度无法区分大多数ASCII类别，高内部平均相似度的类别有明显可区分性，瓶颈在于表示。

Conclusion: ASCII艺术可作为多模态表示的压力测试，需开发适合符号视觉模式的新嵌入方法或评估指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated several emergent behaviors with scale, including reasoning and fluency in long-form text generation. However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

Result: 在不同基准和模型架构上的大量实验验证了FDM的可扩展性，证明FDM - A实现了更优的效率 - 性能权衡。

Conclusion: 研究可能为大语言扩散模型提供更强大的解码方法。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) benefit from a flexible decoding mechanism that enables parallelized inference and controllable generations over autoregressive models. Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A. Our work might potentially provide a principled step toward more powerful decoding methods for LLDMs.

Abstract: Data quality monitoring is a core challenge in modern information processing systems. While many approaches to detect data errors or shifts have been proposed, few studies investigate the mechanisms governing error generation. We argue that knowing how errors were generated can be key to tracing and fixing them. In this study, we build on existing work in the statistics literature on missing values and propose MechDetect, a simple algorithm to investigate error generation mechanisms. Given a tabular data set and a corresponding error mask, the algorithm estimates whether or not the errors depend on the data using machine learning models. Our work extends established approaches to detect mechanisms underlying missing values and can be readily applied to other error types, provided that an error mask is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MechDetect in experiments on established benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Two pressing topics in the theory of deep learning are the interpretation of feature learning mechanisms and the determination of implicit bias of networks in the rich regime. Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks. Furthermore, even under such limiting settings, predictions often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than such exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results. In addition, we make novel predictions on complex toy architectures, such as three-layer non-linear networks and attention heads, thus extending the scope of first-principle theories of deep learning.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), which constrain both weights and activations to binary values, offer substantial reductions in computational complexity, memory footprint, and energy consumption. These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively.

*Vighnesh Subramaniam,Colin Conwell,Boris Katz,Andrei Barbu,Brian Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Network of Theseus (NoT)方法，可将引导网络架构逐步转换为目标网络架构，解耦优化与部署，拓展推理架构空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中网络架构在训练和推理阶段需保持一致的假设限制了架构选择，因优化困难难以选用有理想效率或设计特性的架构。

Method: 通过逐步将引导网络架构的组件替换为目标架构模块，并通过表征相似性指标进行对齐。

Result: 即使在架构大幅变化时，该方法也能基本保留引导网络的功能，如将卷积网络转换为多层感知机、GPT - 2转换为循环神经网络。

Conclusion: NoT解耦了优化和部署，拓展了可行推理架构的空间，有助于实现更好的精度 - 效率权衡，推动架构设计空间的定向探索。

Abstract: A standard assumption in deep learning is that the inductive bias introduced by a neural network architecture must persist from training through inference. The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network. By decoupling optimization from deployment, NoT expands the space of viable inference-time architectures, opening opportunities for better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs and enabling more directed exploration of the architectural design space.

Motivation: 参数高效微调（PEFT）仅更新大模型小部分参数，需更好的PEFT框架，同时考虑边缘AI硬件非理想推理条件。

Method: 提出GRASP框架，将所选层的D维令牌表示划分为K << D组并学习共享缩放和偏移向量；提出StochGRASP，学习高斯分布作为预训练权重的扰动，结合噪声感知损失函数。

Result: GRASP在GLUE和E2E NLG任务上匹配或超越现有PEFT方法，可训练参数比LoRA和BitFit减少一个数量级；StochGRASP在不同噪声水平下始终优于确定性变体。

Conclusion: GRASP和StochGRASP是有效的PEFT方法，StochGRASP适合节能且易受噪声影响的硬件平台。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.

Abstract: Modelling the complexity and diversity of human activity scheduling behaviour is inherently challenging. We demonstrate a deep conditional-generative machine learning approach for the modelling of realistic activity schedules depending on input labels such as an individual's age, employment status, or other information relevant to their scheduling. We combine (i) a structured latent generative approach, with (ii) a conditional approach, through a novel Conditional VAE architecture. This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels. This comparison highlights the usefulness of explicitly modelling the randomness of complex and diverse human behaviours using deep generative approaches.

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance.

Abstract: Predicting the inhibitory potency of small molecules against Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1)-a key target in overcoming cancer chemoresistance-remains a critical challenge in early drug discovery. We present a deep learning framework for the quantitative regression of pIC50 values from molecular Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using fine-tuned variants of ChemBERTa, a pre-trained chemical language model. Leveraging a large-scale consensus dataset of 177,092 compounds, we systematically evaluate two pre-training strategies-Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Token Regression (MTR)-under stratified data splits and sample weighting to address severe activity imbalance which only 2.1% are active. Our approach outperforms classical baselines Random Predictor in both regression accuracy and virtual screening utility, and has competitive performance compared to Random Forest, achieving high enrichment factor EF@1% 17.4 and precision Precision@1% 37.4 among top-ranked predictions. The resulting model, validated through rigorous ablation and hyperparameter studies, provides a robust, ready-to-deploy tool for prioritizing TDP1 inhibitors for experimental testing. By enabling accurate, 3D-structure-free pIC50 prediction directly from SMILES, this work demonstrates the transformative potential of chemical transformers in accelerating target-specific drug discovery.

Abstract: Spectral gradient methods, such as the recently popularized Muon optimizer, are a promising alternative to standard Euclidean gradient descent for training deep neural networks and transformers, but it is still unclear in which regimes they are expected to perform better. We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios. Together, these results identify conditions for spectral gradient methods, such as Muon, to be effective in training deep networks and transformers.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注ReLU激活函数和集中式训练环境，本文旨在研究不同激活函数在集中式和联邦学习环境下对机器学习模型鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 在集中式环境提出结合模型架构改变、软标签、简化数据增强和变学习率的高级对抗训练方法，对十种激活函数进行实验；将该方法扩展到联邦学习环境，考虑IID和非IID数据设置，在非IID数据下引入数据共享。

Conclusion: 适当比例的数据共享能显著提高机器学习模型鲁棒性，对实际应用有帮助。

Abstract: Adversarial training is an effective method to improve the machine learning (ML) model robustness. Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.

Motivation: 以往将LSA与GD联系的研究条件过于简化，本文旨在研究更现实条件下多头LSA对GD的近似。

Method: 引入初始猜测扩展多头LSA嵌入矩阵，证明ICL线性回归设置所需头数的上界，引入yq - LSA并进行理论分析和实验验证。

Result: 实验证实所需头数上界，发现一步GD和多头LSA存在性能差距，yq - LSA缩小差距，大语言模型在语义相似性任务上性能提升。

Conclusion: 扩展了连接上下文学习（ICL）和GD的理论，提升了大语言模型在语义相似性任务上的性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) is a striking phenomenon, yet its underlying mechanisms remain only partially understood. Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task.

Motivation: 传统强化学习后训练优化单一标量目标，忽略解的生成结构，探究使用规范求解器顺序的标量提示能否提升性能。

Method: 在数独任务上，先使用标准微调在随机求解顺序上训练Transformer，再用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)进行后训练，设置单元格准确率和排序奖励两种奖励，通过固定混合和简单的自举缩放结合两种奖励。

Result: 混合奖励通常优于仅优化单元格准确率，最佳混合比在测试准确率上显著高于在随机顺序上训练的仅微调模型，接近在求解器顺序序列上训练的仅微调模型。

Conclusion: 粗略的排序信号可以引导强化学习后训练朝着求解器顺序轨迹进行，而无需修改监督数据或架构。

Abstract: Post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) typically optimizes a single scalar objective and ignores structure in how solutions are produced. We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.

Abstract: Surrogate models (including deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms in supervised learning) are capable of approximating arbitrarily complex, high-dimensional input-output problems in science and engineering, but require a thorough data-agnostic uncertainty quantification analysis before these can be deployed for any safety-critical application. The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.

Conclusion: 部署WebAgents在现实长期用户交互场景存在关键挑战，为开发更强大的智能体架构提供了见解。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly integrated into daily digital interactions, their ability to reason across long interaction histories becomes crucial for providing personalized and contextually aware assistance. However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.

Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.

Result: 通过超百万GPU小时实验和上万次双盲人工评估，在高分辨率视频生成任务中显著改善奖励，减轻奖励破解问题。

Conclusion: DDRL建立了一个强大且可扩展的扩散后训练范式。

Abstract: Aligning generative diffusion models with human preferences via reinforcement learning (RL) is critical yet challenging. Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.

Abstract: Early detection of cancer plays a key role in improving survival rates, but identifying reliable biomarkers from RNA-seq data is still a major challenge. The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation. These results suggest that RGE-GCN shows promise as a generalizable approach for RNA-seq based early cancer detection and biomarker discovery (https://rce-gcn.streamlit.app/ ).

Abstract: Popular offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on conservatism, either by penalizing out-of-dataset actions or by restricting planning horizons. In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL.

Motivation: 现有检测大语言模型不确定性的方法过于复杂，依赖脆弱的语义聚类或内部状态。

Method: 引入径向分散得分（RDS），一种在嵌入空间中测量采样生成的径向分散的不确定性度量，还有轻量级概率加权变体。

Result: RDS及其变体在四个具有挑战性的自由形式问答数据集和多个大语言模型上，优于九个强大的基线，实现了最先进的幻觉检测和答案选择性能。

Conclusion: RDS度量简单、无参数、模型无关，在检测大语言模型不确定性方面表现良好，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Detecting when large language models (LLMs) are uncertain is critical for building reliable systems, yet existing methods are overly complicated, relying on brittle semantic clustering or internal states. We introduce \textbf{Radial Dispersion Score (RDS)}, a simple, parameter-free, fully model-agnostic uncertainty metric that measures the radial dispersion of sampled generations in embedding space. A lightweight probability-weighted variant further incorporates the model's own token probabilities when available, outperforming different nine strong baselines. Moroever, RDS naturally extends to per-sample scoring, enabling applications such as best-of-$N$ selection and confidence-based filtering. Across four challenging free-form QA datasets and multiple LLMs, our metrics achieve state-of-the-art hallucination detection and answer selection performance, while remaining robust and scalable with respect to sample size and embedding choice.

Conclusion: 机器学习驱动的CDS系统配合精心的实施和治理过程，可精准指导住院患者实验室测试，安全减少不必要的重复测试。

Abstract: Repetitive laboratory testing unlikely to yield clinically useful information is a common practice that burdens patients and increases healthcare costs. Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.

Motivation: 细粒度空气污染预测对城市管理和健康建筑发展至关重要，但非专用移动平台收集的传感器数据不完整且时间不一致，需要有效方法进行预测。

Method: 探索扩散模型反向过程的潜在训练模式，提出STeP - Diff，利用DeepONet建模测量的空间序列，结合PDE信息扩散模型从数据中预测时空场，并通过PDE约束正则化框架使去噪过程收敛到对流扩散动力学。

Conclusion: STeP - Diff能有效捕捉空气污染场的时空依赖关系。

Abstract: Fine-grained air pollution forecasting is crucial for urban management and the development of healthy buildings. Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.

Abstract: Powerful large language models (LLMs) from different providers have been expensively trained and finetuned to specialize across varying domains. In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization.

Motivation: 挑战深度学习总是优于旧技术的普遍观点。

Method: 将基于192个自定义特征的人工神经网络、混合卷积神经网络和支持向量机进行对比测试，使用1785个专家分级的金币数据。

Result: 人工神经网络精确匹配率达86%，允许3级误差时达98%；卷积神经网络和支持向量机精确匹配率仅31%和30%。

Conclusion: 数据少于2000且类别不平衡时，通过特征设计融入专业知识优于深度学习，适用于数据少、专业知识重要的小众质量检查场景。

Abstract: We challenge the common belief that deep learning always trumps older techniques, using the example of grading Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle gold coins automatically. In our work, we put a feature-based Artificial Neural Network built around 192 custom features pulled from Sobel edge detection and HSV color analysis up against a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network that blends in EfficientNetV2, plus a straightforward Support Vector Machine as the control. Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups. This rings true for other niche quality checks where data's thin and know-how matters more than raw compute.

Result: 在GPU - NDP系统评估中，相比现有方法解码吞吐量提升达8.7倍，平均精度仅下降0.13%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在最小化跨设备移动的同时，实现GPU和NDP执行重叠，有效提升性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models through conditional computation, but inference becomes memory-bound once expert weights exceed the capacity of GPU memory. In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop.

Result: 广泛实验验证PSCA在多个数据集上有优越性能

Conclusion: PSCA能有效解决现有域自适应检索方法的局限，实现有效域自适应检索

Abstract: Domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, enabling effective retrieval while mitigating domain discrepancies. However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an important area in the AI community, and interpretability is crucial for building robust and trustworthy AI models. While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis. Additionally, we compare our method against multiple baselines in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: 理论上，奖励过滤顺序推理比标准TTC范式有更严格的保证；实证上，在不同基准测试中比广泛使用的方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的奖励过滤顺序推理框架具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Test-time compute (TTC) has become an increasingly prominent paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs). Despite the empirical success of methods such as best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling and sequential revision, their fundamental limits remain unclear. We address this gap by analyzing a mixture-of-reference policy model and proving that standard BoN is inherently suboptimal. To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones. On the theoretical side, we show that reward-filtered sequential inference yields strictly stronger guarantees than standard TTC paradigms. On the empirical side, we evaluate such an inference strategy across diverse benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over widely used approaches, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: SQDF能有效缓解扩散模型微调中的过优化问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-likelihood samples but often require alignment with downstream objectives. Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose \textbf{Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF)}, a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment. Furthermore, in online black-box optimization, SQDF attains high sample efficiency while maintaining naturalness and diversity.

Abstract: Generative machine learning (ML) models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery through the inverse design of inorganic crystals, enabling an unprecedented exploration of chemical space. Yet, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks makes it challenging to evaluate, compare, and further develop these ML models meaningfully. In this work, we introduce LeMat-GenBench, a unified benchmark for generative models of crystalline materials, supported by a set of evaluation metrics designed to better inform model development and downstream applications. We release both an open-source evaluation suite and a public leaderboard on Hugging Face, and benchmark 12 recent generative models. Results reveal that an increase in stability leads to a decrease in novelty and diversity on average, with no model excelling across all dimensions. Altogether, LeMat-GenBench establishes a reproducible and extensible foundation for fair model comparison and aims to guide the development of more reliable, discovery-oriented generative models for crystalline materials.

Result: 在动态数据集上显著提高鲁棒性，有更高的损坏数据准确率和更可靠的OOD检测；在无时间连续性数据集上表现相当。

Conclusion: Temp - SCONE是迈向动态环境中可靠开放世界学习的一步。

Abstract: Open-world learning (OWL) requires models that can adapt to evolving environments while reliably detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Existing approaches, such as SCONE, achieve robustness to covariate and semantic shifts but assume static environments, leading to degraded performance in dynamic domains. In this paper, we propose Temp-SCONE, a temporally consistent extension of SCONE designed to handle temporal shifts in dynamic environments. Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments.

Experiments on a real world encryption detection task demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed features across several learning algorithms. The learner faces the problem of detecting encryption activities across a large dataset of files, using function call traces and graph based features. Empirical results highlight an outstanding accuracy of 99.28 on the task at hand, underscoring the efficacy of features derived from the function graph tracer. The results were further validated in an additional experiment targeting a multilabel classification problem, in which running programs were identified from trace data. This work provides comprehensive methodologies for preprocessing raw trace data and extracting graph based features, offering significant advancements in applying ML to system behavior analysis, program identification, and anomaly detection. By bridging the gap between system tracing and ML, this paper paves the way for innovative solutions in performance monitoring and security analytics.

Abstract: Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against data sparsity and observational noise.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在点过程模型训练中有效且高效，能解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Score matching estimators have garnered significant attention in recent years because they eliminate the need to compute normalizing constants, thereby mitigating the computational challenges associated with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).While several studies have proposed score matching estimators for point processes, this work highlights the limitations of these existing methods, which stem primarily from the lack of a mathematically rigorous analysis of how score matching behaves on finite point processes -- special random configurations on bounded spaces where many of the usual assumptions and properties of score matching no longer hold. To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency.

Conclusion: 从预测分布角度重新思考DKD有积极意义，GDKD具有更优性能。

Abstract: In the history of knowledge distillation, the focus has once shifted over time from logit-based to feature-based approaches. However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

Conclusion: OSAG可有效解决地球观测模型训练问题，语义细化的合同能降低治理改进的精度成本。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) models are frequently trained under implicit sampling policies that optimize global accuracy but provide no explicit guarantees on who (which regions, classes, or mission-critical strata) is being served throughout training. This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.

Abstract: Effective earthquake risk reduction relies on accurate site-specific evaluations. This requires models that can represent the influence of local site conditions on ground motion characteristics. In this context, data driven approaches that learn site controlled signatures from recorded ground motions offer a promising direction. We address strong ground motion generation from time-domain accelerometer records and introduce the TimesNet-Gen, a time-domain conditional generator. The approach uses a station specific latent bottleneck. We evaluate generation by comparing HVSR curves and fundamental site-frequency $f_0$ distributions between real and generated records per station, and summarize station specificity with a score based on the $f_0$ distribution confusion matrices. TimesNet-Gen achieves strong station-wise alignment and compares favorably with a spectrogram-based conditional VAE baseline for site-specific strong motion synthesis.

Conclusion: 协调器隐藏状态表示提供丰富上下文，在高维严格预算约束下，可分离协方差矩阵自适应进化策略有优势。

Abstract: Combining diverse foundation models is promising, but weight-merging is limited by mismatched architectures and closed APIs. Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability.

Abstract: Gradient optimization algorithms using epochs, that is those based on stochastic gradient descent without replacement (SGDo), are predominantly used to train machine learning models in practice. However, the mathematical theory of SGDo and related algorithms remain underexplored compared to their "with replacement" and "one-pass" counterparts. In this article, we propose a stochastic, continuous-time approximation to SGDo with additive noise based on a Young differential equation driven by a stochastic process we call an "epoched Brownian motion". We show its usefulness by proving the almost sure convergence of the continuous-time approximation for strongly convex objectives and learning rate schedules of the form $u_t = \frac{1}{(1+t)^β}, β\in (0,1)$. Moreover, we compute an upper bound on the asymptotic rate of almost sure convergence, which is as good or better than previous results for SGDo.

Abstract: This article serves as the regression analysis lecture notes in the Intelligent Computing course cluster (including the courses of Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Pattern Recognition). It aims to provide students -- who are assumed to possess only basic university-level mathematics (i.e., with prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory) -- with a comprehensive and self-contained understanding of regression analysis without requiring any additional references. The lecture notes systematically introduce the fundamental concepts, modeling components, and theoretical foundations of regression analysis, covering linear regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, polynomial regression, basis-function models, kernel-based methods, and neural-network-based nonlinear regression. Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables. By bridging classical statistical modeling and modern machine-learning practice, these lecture notes aim to equip students with a solid conceptual and technical foundation for further study in advanced artificial intelligence models.

Conclusion: RLHFSpec有效缓解生成瓶颈，能提升RLHF执行性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an important fine-tuning technique for large language models (LLMs) and comprises three stages: generation, inference, and training. The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works. Moreover, due to the effective alleviation of the generation bottleneck, RLHFSpec also shows significant performance speedup in the entire RLHF execution.

Abstract: Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context. Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.

Conclusion: 通过研究覆盖数等方法可对能用小特征集线性组合良好近似的高维函数类进行分析和界定。

Abstract: In general, approximating classes of functions defined over high-dimensional input spaces by linear combinations of a fixed set of basis functions or ``features'' is known to be hard. Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $Θ\(n^{-1/d}\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes.

Abstract: Intraday surgical scheduling is a multi-objective decision problem under uncertainty-balancing elective throughput, urgent and emergency demand, delays, sequence-dependent setups, and overtime. We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions. Overall, the approach offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling.

Result: 在不同评估设置的训练和推理中，CARL表现更强且效率更高。

Conclusion: CARL算法在多步智能体任务中有效且具有优势。

Abstract: Agents capable of accomplishing complex tasks through multiple interactions with the environment have emerged as a popular research direction. However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for multi-step agents. CARL achieves focused training through providing action-level optimization signals for high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency during training and inference across diverse evaluation settings.

Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.

Result: 可实现抽象避免了非马尔可夫性问题且有近似最优保证，RARL算法可能近似正确，样本数多项式收敛，对抽象不准确有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可实现抽象和RARL算法能有效解决HRL中MDP抽象的相关问题。

Abstract: The main focus of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is studying how large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be more efficiently solved when addressed in a modular way, by combining partial solutions computed for smaller subtasks. Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction.

Motivation: 现有神经算子在解决偏微分方程时存在扩展性差、动态展开误差积累和特定任务设计等局限，需要改进。

Result: 在具有复杂几何、高频动态和长期范围的多种PDE系统的百万点模拟中展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECHO框架有效解决了现有神经算子的问题，能在多种PDE系统模拟中取得优异效果。

Abstract: We introduce ECHO, a transformer-operator framework for generating million-point PDE trajectories. While existing neural operators (NOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations, they remain limited in practice due to poor scalability on dense grids, error accumulation during dynamic unrolling, and task-specific design. ECHO addresses these challenges through three key innovations. (i) It employs a hierarchical convolutional encode-decode architecture that achieves a 100 $\times$ spatio-temporal compression while preserving fidelity on mesh points. (ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on million-point simulations across diverse PDE systems featuring complex geometries, high-frequency dynamics, and long-term horizons.

Method: 提出双路径区域引导注意力网络，将解剖学启发的空间先验和时间先验融入区域级注意力机制，互补路径从全传感器场捕获上下文，两条路径联合训练并合并输出。

Result: 模型在两个数据集上优于CNN和CNN - LSTM等基线模型，在鞋垫数据集上六分量平均NRMSE最低达5.78%，在公共数据集上垂直地面反作用力NRMSE为1.42%。

Conclusion: 模型在地面反作用力和力矩估计方面表现稳健。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of three-dimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRFs/GRMs) is crucial for both biomechanics research and clinical rehabilitation evaluation. In this study, we focus on insole-based GRF/GRM estimation and further validate our approach on a public walking dataset. We propose a Dual-Path Region-Guided Attention Network that integrates anatomy-inspired spatial priors and temporal priors into a region-level attention mechanism, while a complementary path captures context from the full sensor field. The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation.

Conclusion: 超级激活机制有效，可用于改进概念特征归因。

Abstract: Concept vectors aim to enhance model interpretability by linking internal representations with human-understandable semantics, but their utility is often limited by noisy and inconsistent activations. In this work, we uncover a clear pattern within the noise, which we term the SuperActivator Mechanism: while in-concept and out-of-concept activations overlap considerably, the token activations in the extreme high tail of the in-concept distribution provide a reliable signal of concept presence. We demonstrate the generality of this mechanism by showing that SuperActivator tokens consistently outperform standard vector-based and prompting concept detection approaches, achieving up to a 14% higher F1 score across image and text modalities, model architectures, model layers, and concept extraction techniques. Finally, we leverage SuperActivator tokens to improve feature attributions for concepts.

Abstract: As healthcare increasingly turns to AI for scalable and trustworthy clinical decision support, ensuring reliability in model reasoning remains a critical challenge. Individual large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations and inconsistency, whereas naive ensembles of models often fail to deliver stable and credible recommendations. Building on our previous work on LLM Chemistry, which quantifies the collaborative compatibility among LLMs, we apply this framework to improve the reliability in medication recommendation from brief clinical vignettes. Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations. Preliminary results are encouraging, suggesting that LLM Chemistry-guided collaboration may offer a promising path toward reliable and trustworthy AI assistants in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 给出HQC自编码器用于网络入侵检测行为的首个数据驱动表征，指出影响其实用性的关键因素。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly-based intrusion detection requires models that can generalize to attack patterns not observed during training. This work presents the first large-scale evaluation of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) autoencoders for this task. We construct a unified experimental framework that iterates over key quantum design choices, including quantum-layer placement, measurement approach, variational and non-variational formulations, and latent-space regularization. Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs. These results provide the first data-driven characterization of HQC autoencoder behavior for network intrusion detection and outline key factors that govern their practical viability.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) focuses on designing small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training. OMTRA obtains state of the art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking; however, the effects of large-scale pretraining and multi-task training are modest.

Abstract: Gradient-based iterative optimization methods are the workhorse of modern machine learning. They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector. Our approach can be used to bound the sample complexity for minimizing both the validation loss as well as the number of gradient descent iterations.

Abstract: Real-world physical processes do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact and low-variability subsets of functional space. This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems.
  This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown.
  We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.
  Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.

Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.

Conclusion: BabySeg有效解决了婴幼儿脑MRI分割方法碎片化问题，具有更好的通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools.

Conclusion: 该方法可实现流匹配模型有效且保留先验的对齐。

Abstract: While methods exist for aligning flow matching models--a popular and effective class of generative models--with human preferences, existing approaches fail to achieve both adaptation efficiency and probabilistically sound prior preservation. In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.

Abstract: Dendrite-inspired neurons have been widely used in tasks such as image classification due to low computational complexity and fast inference speed. Temporal data prediction, as a key machine learning task, plays a key role in real-time scenarios such as sensor data analysis, financial forecasting, and urban traffic management. However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings. Compared with traditional neurons without dendritic functions, Memory-DD requires only two neuron groups to extract logical relationships between features in input sequences. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%. These results demonstrate that Memory-DD successfully extends the low-complexity advantages of dendrite-inspired neurons to temporal prediction, providing a low-complexity and efficient solution for time-series data processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across research domains to tackle complex tasks, but their performance can vary significantly depending on the task at hand. Evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can be used to refine solutions iteratively at inference-time. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been exploration on leveraging the collective capabilities of multi-source seeding for LLM-guided genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, MultiGA, which applies genetic algorithm principles to address complex natural language tasks and reasoning problems by sampling from a diverse population of LLMs to initialize the population. MultiGA generates a range of outputs from various parent LLMs, open source and closed source, and uses a neutral fitness function to evaluate them. Through an iterative recombination process, we mix and refine these generations until an optimal solution is achieved. We benchmark our approach using text-to-SQL code generation tasks, trip planning, GPQA benchmark for grad-level science questions, and the BBQ bias benchmark. Our results show that MultiGA converges to the accuracy of the LLM best fit for the task, and these insights lay the foundation for future research looking closer at integrating multiple LLMs for unexplored tasks in which selecting only one pre-trained model is unclear or suboptimal.

Abstract: Designing Zero-Emissions Buildings (ZEBs) involves balancing numerous complex objectives that traditional methods struggle to address. Fenestration, encompassing façade openings and shading systems, plays a critical role in ZEB performance due to its high thermal transmittance and solar radiation admission. This paper presents a novel simulation-based optimization method for fenestration designed for practical application. It uses a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm and relies on rules and an updatable catalog, to fully automate the design process, create a highly diverse search space, minimize biases, and generate detailed solutions ready for architectural prescription. Nineteen fenestration variables, over which architects have design flexibility, were optimized to reduce heating, cooling demand, and thermal discomfort in residential buildings.

Conclusion: MD - SNN能有效解决SNNs量化问题，在数据处理和硬件效率上有优势。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks, thanks to their sparse binary activation. However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) in expressive search spaces is a computationally hard problem, but it also holds the potential to automatically discover completely novel and performant architectures. To achieve this we need effective search algorithms that can identify powerful components and reuse them in new candidate architectures. In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS.

Result: 在多种训练方法、不同架构和数据集上，AHSAR持续改进强基线并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将层活动保持在适度范围内是可扩展且高效的SNN训练的简单有效原则。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event driven computation, sparse activation, and hardware efficiency, yet training often converges slowly and lacks stability. We present Adaptive Homeostatic Spiking Activity Regulation (AHSAR), an extremely simple plug in and training paradigm agnostic method that stabilizes optimization and accelerates convergence without changing the model architecture, loss, or gradients. AHSAR introduces no trainable parameters. It maintains a per layer homeostatic state during the forward pass, maps centered firing rate deviations to threshold scales through a bounded nonlinearity, uses lightweight cross layer diffusion to avoid sharp imbalance, and applies a slow across epoch global gain that combines validation progress with activity energy to tune the operating point. The computational cost is negligible. Across diverse training methods, SNN architectures of different depths, widths, and temporal steps, and both RGB and DVS datasets, AHSAR consistently improves strong baselines and enhances out of distribution robustness. These results indicate that keeping layer activity within a moderate band is a simple and effective principle for scalable and efficient SNN training.

TL;DR: 研究检索增强提示在代码漏洞检测中的少样本性能，结果显示其优于其他提示策略，避免微调成本，但CodeBERT微调性能更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示在复杂领域效果依赖上下文示例选择和质量，研究检索增强提示提升代码漏洞检测的少样本性能。

Method: 使用Gemini - 1.5 - Flash模型，对比标准少样本提示、检索增强提示、基于检索的标注三种方法，并与零样本提示和多个微调模型对比。

Result: 检索增强提示始终优于其他提示策略，20次提示时F1分数74.05%，部分匹配准确率83.90%；优于零样本和微调的Gemini，但不如微调的CodeBERT。

Conclusion: 检索增强提示可提升少样本性能，避免微调成本，但CodeBERT微调虽需额外资源，性能更高。

Abstract: Few-shot prompting has emerged as a practical alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in specialized tasks. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning. On the other hand, fine-tuning CodeBERT yields higher performance (F1 score: 91.22%, partial match accuracy: 91.30%) but requires additional training, maintenance effort, and resources.

Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents are reshaping the development paradigm. However, existing evaluation systems, neither traditional tests for humans nor benchmarks for LLMs, fail to capture this shift. They remain focused on well-defined algorithmic problems, which excludes problems where success depends on human-AI collaboration. Such collaborative problems not only require human reasoning to interpret complex contexts and guide solution strategies, but also demand AI efficiency for implementation. To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its "Collaboration-Necessary" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%. Our analysis reveals an emerging co-reasoning partnership. This finding challenges the traditional human-tool hierarchy by showing that strategic breakthroughs can originate from either humans or AI. HAI-Eval establishes not only a challenging benchmark for next-generation coding agents but also a grounded, scalable framework for assessing core developer competencies in the AI era. Our benchmark and interactive demo will be openly accessible.

Abstract: One of the challenges in twinned systems is ensuring the digital twin remains a valid representation of the system it twins. Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports. Treating anomalies also means correcting the error in the digital twin, which we do with a parameter estimation based on the historical data.

Result: DrP在Meta大规模部署，每天执行50K次自动化分析，平均MTTR降低20%，部分团队超80%，值班效率显著提升。

Conclusion: DrP能有效降低事件解决时间和值班负担，提高值班效率。

Abstract: Investigations are a significant step in the operational workflows for large scale systems across multiple domains such as services, data, AI/ML, mobile. Investigation processes followed by on-call engineers are often manual or rely on ad-hoc scripts. This leads to inefficient investigations resulting in increased time to mitigate and isolate failures/SLO violations. It also contributes to on-call toil and poor productivity leading to multiple hours/days spent in triaging/debugging incidents. In this paper, we present DrP, an end-to-end framework and system to automate investigations that reduces the mean time to resolve incidents (MTTR) and reduces on-call toil. DrP consists of an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks in code (called analyzers), a scalable backend system to execute these automated playbooks, plug-ins to integrate playbooks into mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools, and a post-processing system to take actions on investigations including mitigation steps.
  We have implemented and deployed DrP at large scale at Meta covering 300+ teams, 2000+ analyzers, across a large set of use cases across domains such as services, core infrastructure, AI/ML, hardware, mobile. DrP has been running in production for the past 5 years and executes 50K automated analyses per day. Overall, our results and experience show that DrP has been able to reduce average MTTR by 20 percent at large scale (with over 80 percent for some teams) and has significantly improved on-call productivity.

Abstract: Context. The rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot has transformed how software is learned and written. In software engineering (SE) education, these tools offer new opportunities for support, but also raise concerns about over-reliance, ethical use, and impacts on learning. Objective. This study investigates how undergraduate SE students use GenAI tools, focusing on the benefits, challenges, ethical concerns, and instructional expectations that shape their experiences. Method. We conducted a survey with 130 undergraduate students from two universities. The survey combined structured Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to investigate five dimensions: usage context, perceived benefits, challenges, ethical and instructional perceptions. Results. Students most often use GenAI for incremental learning and advanced implementation, reporting benefits such as brainstorming support and confidence-building. At the same time, they face challenges including unclear rationales and difficulty adapting outputs. Students highlight ethical concerns around fairness and misconduct, and call for clearer instructional guidance. Conclusion. GenAI is reshaping SE education in nuanced ways. Our findings underscore the need for scaffolding, ethical policies, and adaptive instructional strategies to ensure that GenAI supports equitable and effective learning.

Result: 问题检测有一定一致性，平均Cohen's Kappa为0.50，精确一致性84%；严重程度判断差异大，加权Cohen's Kappa平均0.63，精确一致性56%，Krippendorff's Alpha接近零。

Conclusion: GPT - 4o在识别可用性问题上能产生内部一致的评估，但判断严重程度需人工监督，本研究凸显了LLMs用于早期自动化可用性测试的可行性与局限，为提高自动化用户体验评估的一致性奠定基础。

Abstract: Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides one of the first quantitative inter-rater reliability analyses of automated heuristic evaluation and highlights methods for improving model consistency.

Abstract: This work presents the Polynomiogram framework, an integrated computational platform for exploring, visualizing, and generating art from polynomial root systems. The main innovation is a flexible sampling scheme in which two independent parameters are drawn from user defined domains and mapped to the polynomial coefficients through a generating function. This design allows the same mathematical foundation to support both scientific investigation and generative algorithmic art. The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition.

Motivation: 大型语言模型从代码完成工具转变为自主系统架构师，其对长期软件可维护性的影响未量化，现有研究仅关注功能正确性，需衡量架构侵蚀和技术债务。

Conclusion: 若无自动架构检查，使用小型开源模型进行系统搭建会加速结构技术债务的积累。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from code completion tools to autonomous system architects, their impact on long-term software maintainability remains unquantified. While existing research benchmarks functional correctness (pass@k), this study presents the first empirical framework to measure "Architectural Erosion" and the accumulation of Technical Debt in AI-synthesized microservices. We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of "Implementation Laziness," where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints. These findings suggest that without automated architectural linting, utilizing smaller open-weights models for system scaffolding accelerates the accumulation of structural technical debt.

Abstract: The reliable application of deep learning models to software engineering tasks hinges on high-quality training data. Yet, large-scale repositories inevitably introduce noisy or mislabeled examples that degrade both accuracy and robustness. While Noise Label Learning (NLL) has been extensively studied in other fields, there are a few works that investigate NLL in Software Engineering (SE) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for SE tasks. In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others. However, with MANTRA, the performance of all models in both tasks is improved. MANTRA enables researchers and practitioners to reduce the impact of errors introduced by the dataset in training, saves time in data cleaning and processing, while maximizing the effect of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 针对性模糊测试与管道模糊测试互补，TargetFuzz无需手工编码生成器或特定语言变异器，对模块化框架有用。

Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of compiler optimizations is critical, but existing fuzzers struggle to test optimizations effectively. First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\times$ and 2.6$\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode. We show that targeted fuzzing is complementary: it effectively tests all 37 sampled LLVM optimizations, while pipeline-fuzzing missed 12.

Abstract: Workflow automation promises substantial productivity gains in everyday document-related tasks. While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced. Code: https://github.com/YJett/AutoDW

TL;DR: 提出LLM - SrcLog框架用于日志模板解析，结合源码和数据驱动方法，实验显示其在速度和准确性上有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前日志解析器多为被动且以日志为中心，忽略源码，难以掌握动态日志结构和适应系统变化，且逐日志的大语言模型推理成本高。

Method: LLM - SrcLog框架，从源码直接提取模板，对无代码日志进行数据驱动解析，集成了跨函数静态代码分析器、基于大语言模型的白盒模板提取器和黑盒模板提取器。

Result: 在两个公开基准和一个工业系统上实验，相比两个基于大语言模型的基线，平均F1分数提升2 - 17%和8 - 35%，在线解析延迟与数据驱动方法相当，比逐日志大语言模型解析快约1000倍。

Conclusion: LLM - SrcLog在速度和准确性之间实现了近乎理想的平衡，实际案例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Log parsing transforms raw logs into structured templates containing constants and variables. It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy. Finally, we further validate the effectiveness of LLM-SrcLog through practical case studies in a real-world production environment.

TL;DR: 提出CoCo框架用于代码补全，能理解大规模代码仓库多粒度上下文，实验表现超现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法将代码视为普通自然语言，忽略结构语义和代码特定依赖，限制生成代码质量。

Method: 采用静态代码分析提取多级别结构化上下文，用基于图的多粒度上下文选择机制过滤信息，转换为自然语言作提示，还有结构感知代码重排机制。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval基准测试中，CoCo始终超越现有基线，EM提升达20.2%，且框架与模型无关，可集成到现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCo框架有效解决现有代码补全方法问题，提升代码补全质量。

Abstract: As code completion task from function-level to repository-level, leveraging contextual information from large-scale codebases becomes a core challenge. However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM. Moreover, the framework is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods, leading to significant performance.

Method: 对5个通用和3个特定代码的大语言模型在6个涵盖语言能力、数学推理和可信度的基准上进行综合评估，分析模型在CoNaLa数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: 代码优化的大语言模型在推理和句法精度方面表现更优，在多任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized both general natural language processing and domain-specific applications such as code synthesis, legal reasoning, and finance. However, while prior studies have explored individual model capabilities, a systematic cross-domain comparison that unifies linguistic, reasoning, and code understanding abilities remains underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of five general-purpose and three code-specific state-of-the-art LLMs across six diverse benchmarks encompassing linguistic competence, mathematical reasoning, and trustworthiness. Additionally, we analyze model behavior on the CoNaLa dataset for code explanation, comparing natural language and code-specialized LLMs. Our findings reveal that models optimized for code (e.g., CodeLLaMA variants) exhibit strong reasoning and syntactic precision, that even for non-coding tasks can show measurable performance gains, in contrast to general-purpose models like Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B.

Result: 整理出GenAI应用于SASs的潜在好处类别，给出整合GenAI到SASs的研究路线图。

Conclusion: 提出关键研究挑战，反思GenAI不足并给出缓解策略。

Abstract: Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.

<details>

Motivation: 现代软件生态系统带来不确定性，传统自适应方法难以应对新情况，Self - Adaptation 2.0强调AI与自适应系统结合

Method: 引入POLARIS框架，包含适配器层、推理层和元层，通过共享知识和预测模型处理不确定性

Result: 在SWIM和SWITCH两个示例上评估，POLARIS始终优于现有基线

Conclusion: 标志着向Self - Adaptation 3.0转变，系统能自我推理和进化适应过程

Abstract: The growing scale, complexity, interconnectivity, and autonomy of modern software ecosystems introduce unprecedented uncertainty, challenging the foundations of traditional self-adaptation. Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges.

Conclusion: 给出Kubernetes配置脚本缺陷检测和修复技术的使用建议。

Abstract: Kubernetes is a tool that facilitates rapid deployment of software. Unfortunately, configuring Kubernetes is prone to errors. Configuration defects are not uncommon and can result in serious consequences. This paper reports an empirical study about configuration defects in Kubernetes with the goal of helping practitioners detect and prevent these defects. We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts. The datasets and source code used for the paper are publicly available online.

Result: 部分多元策略有显著统计准确性，能平衡信息信号与噪声；统计表现和实际交易效用存在差异，低预测误差不总带来高财务回报。

Abstract: Forecasting cryptocurrency prices is hindered by extreme volatility and a methodological dilemma between information-scarce univariate models and noise-prone full-multivariate models. This paper investigates a partial-multivariate approach to balance this trade-off, hypothesizing that a strategic subset of features offers superior predictive power. We apply the Partial-Multivariate Transformer (PMformer) to forecast daily returns for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT, benchmarking it against eleven classical and deep learning models. Our empirical results yield two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate that the partial-multivariate strategy achieves significant statistical accuracy, effectively balancing informative signals with noise. Second, we experiment and discuss an observable disconnect between this statistical performance and practical trading utility; lower prediction error did not consistently translate to higher financial returns in simulations. This finding challenges the reliance on traditional error metrics and highlights the need to develop evaluation criteria more aligned with real-world financial objectives.

Method: 文中未提及具体研究方法。

Result: 文中未提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 得出对实际交易重要的定性见解。

Abstract: As the FX markets continue to evolve, many institutions have started offering passive access to their internal liquidity pools. Market makers act as principal and have the opportunity to fill those orders as part of their risk management, or they may choose to adjust pricing to their external OTC franchise to facilitate the matching flow. It is, a priori, unclear how the strategies managing internal liquidity should depend on market condions, the market maker's risk appetite, and the placement algorithms deployed by participating clients. The market maker's actions in the presence of passive orders are relevant not only for their own objectives, but also for those liquidity providers who have certain expectations of the execution speed. In this work, we investigate the optimal multi-objective strategy of a market maker with an option to take liquidity on an internal exchange, and draw important qualitative insights for real-world trading.

Conclusion: 建模信息性缺失提供了统一似然推理和经验半监督方法的统计框架。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) constructs classifiers using both labelled and unlabelled data. It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed. This improvement arises particularly when class overlap is moderate, labelled data are sparse, and the missingness is informative. Modelling such informative missingness thus offers a coherent statistical framework that unifies likelihood-based inference with the behaviour of empirical SSL methods.

Abstract: We present a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed explicitly for day-ahead electricity price forecasting, aimed at improving short-term decision-making and operational management in energy systems. Our combined forecasting model embeds linear structures, such as expert models and Kalman filters, into recurrent networks, enabling efficient computation and enhanced interpretability. The design leverages the strengths of both linear and non-linear model structures, allowing it to capture all relevant stylised price characteristics in power markets, including calendar and autoregressive effects, as well as influences from load, renewable energy, and related fuel and carbon markets. For empirical testing, we use hourly data from the largest European electricity market spanning 2018 to 2025 in a comprehensive forecasting study, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, particularly high-dimensional linear and neural network models. The proposed model achieves approximately 12% higher accuracy than leading benchmarks. We evaluate the contributions of the interpretable model components and conclude on the impact of combining linear and non-linear structures.

Abstract: We develop a flexible feature selection framework based on deep neural networks that approximately controls the false discovery rate (FDR), a measure of Type-I error. The method applies to architectures whose first layer is fully connected. From the second layer onward, it accommodates multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) of arbitrary width and depth, convolutional and recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, residual connections, and dropout. The procedure also accommodates stochastic gradient descent with data-independent initializations and learning rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee of FDR control for feature selection within such a general deep learning setting.
  Our analysis is built upon a multi-index data-generating model and an asymptotic regime in which the feature dimension $n$ diverges faster than the latent dimension $q^{*}$, while the sample size, the number of training iterations, the network depth, and hidden layer widths are left unrestricted. Under this setting, we show that each coordinate of the gradient-based feature-importance vector admits a marginal normal approximation, thereby supporting the validity of asymptotic FDR control. As a theoretical limitation, we assume $\mathbf{B}$-right orthogonal invariance of the design matrix, and we discuss broader generalizations. We also present numerical experiments that underscore the theoretical findings.

Abstract: This thesis develops methods for causal inference and causal representation learning (CRL) in high-dimensional, time-varying data.
  The first contribution introduces the Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), a model for estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) by capturing unobserved heterogeneity in treatment response driven by latent risk factors that affect only outcomes. CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.
  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference.
  The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions. Scalable Jacobian-based regularization techniques are also developed.

Abstract: Guided or controlled data generation with diffusion models\blfootnote{Partial preliminary results of this work appeared in International Conference on Machine Learning 2025 \citep{li2025provable}.} has become a cornerstone of modern generative modeling. Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Simulating the conditioned dynamics of diffusion processes, given their initial and terminal states, is an important but challenging problem in the sciences. The difficulty is particularly pronounced for rare events, for which the unconditioned dynamics rarely reach the terminal state. In this work, we leverage a self-consistency property of the conditioned dynamics to learn the diffusion bridge in an iterative online manner, and demonstrate promising empirical results in a range of settings.

Abstract: Although diffusion models now occupy a central place in generative modeling, introductory treatments commonly assume Euclidean data and seldom clarify their connection to discrete-state analogues. This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.

TL;DR: 本文生成六个反映现实异常的单峰数据集，对比多种密度估计方法，提出DPR方法，验证其在精度和计算开销上的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据常偏离高斯假设，需评估不同密度估计方法捕捉数据不规则性的能力。

Method: 生成六个单峰数据集，对比参数和非参数方法，实现基于GPU的KDE和直方图估计，提出DPR方法，用MSE、JSD等指标验证精度。

Result: 基于GPU的KDE和直方图估计优于Python SciPy的KDE，4阶DPR结合tKDE在精度和计算开销上达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: DPR方法在单峰分布的密度估计中能有效捕捉不对称形状，在精度和计算开销间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: The probability density function (PDF) plays a central role in statistical and machine learning modeling. Real-world data often deviates from Gaussian assumptions, exhibiting skewness and exponential decay. To evaluate how well different density estimation methods capture such irregularities, we generated six unimodal datasets from diverse distributions that reflect real-world anomalies. These were compared using parametric methods (Pearson Type I and Normal distribution) as well as non-parametric approaches, including histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE), and our proposed method. To accelerate computation, we implemented GPU-based versions of KDE (tKDE) and histogram estimation (tHDE) in TensorFlow, both of which outperform Python SciPy's KDE. Prior work demonstrated the use of piecewise modeling for density estimation, such as local polynomial regression; however, these methods are computationally intensive. Based on the concept of piecewise modeling, we developed a computationally efficient model, the Dual Polynomial Regression (DPR) method, which leverages tKDE or tHDE for training. DPR employs the piecewise strategy to split the PDF at its mode and fit polynomial regressions to the left and right halves independently, enabling better capture of the asymmetric shape of the unimodal distribution. We used the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and Pearson's correlation coefficient, with reference to the baseline PDF, to validate accuracy. We verified normalization using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and computational overhead via execution time. Validation on real-world systolic and diastolic data from 300,000 unique patients shows that the DPR of order 4, trained with tKDE, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational overhead.

Abstract: High-stakes decision domains are increasingly exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks. However, LLM deployment in real-world settings presents challenges in data security, evaluation of its capabilities outside controlled environments, and accountability attribution in the event of adversarial decisions. This paper proposes a framework for responsible deployment of LLM-based decision-support systems through active human involvement. It integrates interactive collaboration between human experts and developers through multiple iterations at the pre-deployment stage to assess the uncertain samples and judge the stability of the explanation provided by post-hoc XAI techniques. Local LLM deployment within organizations and decentralized technologies, such as Blockchain and IPFS, are proposed to create immutable records of LLM activities for automated auditing to enhance security and trace back accountability. It was tested on Bert-large-uncased, Mistral, and LLaMA 2 and 3 models to assess the capability to support responsible financial decisions on business lending.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算需求增加，评估AI环境足迹需超越能源和水消耗，考虑专用硬件的物质需求。

Method: 用光谱分析Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB GPU元素组成，将测量结果与不同寿命下GPU计算吞吐量整合，进行场景分析。

Result: AI硬件约90%是重金属，训练GPT - 4需1174 - 8800个A100 GPU，对应最多7吨有毒元素，软硬件优化可降低物质需求。

Conclusion: AI性能提升物质成本高，讨论AI可扩展性需考虑物质资源，未来AI发展要符合资源效率和环境责任原则。

Abstract: As computational demands continue to rise, assessing the environmental footprint of AI requires moving beyond energy and water consumption to include the material demands of specialized hardware. This study quantifies the material footprint of AI training by linking computational workloads to physical hardware needs. The elemental composition of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, which identified 32 elements. The results show that AI hardware consists of about 90% heavy metals and only trace amounts of precious metals. The elements copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel dominate the GPU composition by mass. In a multi-step methodology, we integrate these measurements with computational throughput per GPU across varying lifespans, accounting for the computational requirements of training specific AI models at different training efficiency regimes. Scenario-based analyses reveal that, depending on Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and hardware lifespan, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, corresponding to the extraction and eventual disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Combined software and hardware optimization strategies can reduce material demands: increasing MFU from 20% to 60% lowers GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings; implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. Our findings highlight that incremental performance gains, such as those observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, come at disproportionately high material costs. The study underscores the necessity of incorporating material resource considerations into discussions of AI scalability, emphasizing that future progress in AI must align with principles of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility.

Abstract: AI agents are actively running in production across diverse industries, yet little is publicly known about which technical approaches enable successful real-world deployments. We present the first large-scale systematic study of AI agents in production, surveying 306 practitioners and conducting 20 in-depth case studies via interviews across 26 domains. We investigate why organizations build agents, how they build them, how they evaluate them, and what the top development challenges are. We find that production agents are typically built using simple, controllable approaches: 68% execute at most 10 steps before requiring human intervention, 70% rely on prompting off-the-shelf models instead of weight tuning, and 74% depend primarily on human evaluation. Reliability remains the top development challenge, driven by difficulties in ensuring and evaluating agent correctness. Despite these challenges, simple yet effective methods already enable agents to deliver impact across diverse industries. Our study documents the current state of practice and bridges the gap between research and deployment by providing researchers visibility into production challenges while offering practitioners proven patterns from successful deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网虽有丰富法律信息和服务，但公民在获取司法帮助时仍面临诸多障碍，需解决公民司法求助难题。

Method: 引入LegalWebAgent框架，结合大语言模型自然语言理解能力和多模态感知，分Ask、Browse、Act三个模块运行；设计涵盖15个现实任务的基准测试进行评估。

Result: LegalWebAgent最高成功率达86.7%，所有测试模型平均成功率84.4%。

Conclusion: LegalWebAgent在复杂现实场景中具有高度自主性，能有效缩小普通公民司法求助差距。

Abstract: Access to justice remains a global challenge, with many citizens still finding it difficult to seek help from the justice system when facing legal issues. Although the internet provides abundant legal information and services, navigating complex websites, understanding legal terminology, and filling out procedural forms continue to pose barriers to accessing justice. This paper introduces the LegalWebAgent framework that employs a web agent powered by multimodal large language models to bridge the gap in access to justice for ordinary citizens. The framework combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with multimodal perception, enabling a complete process from user query to concrete action. It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Québec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations. Evaluation results show LegalWebAgent achieved a peak success rate of 86.7%, with an average of 84.4% across all tested models, demonstrating high autonomy in complex real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要依赖技术指标，忽视人类身份、学习者能动性、情境学习过程和伦理考量，需要改进评估方式。

Method: 基于广泛的文献综述和综合，构建包含十个组件的评估框架和工具包清单。

Result: 提出了TEACH - AI这一领域独立、基于教学法且与利益相关者一致的框架及工具包。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区重新思考教育中有效AI的构成，设计促进共创、包容和长期影响的评估方法。

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform education, most existing AI evaluations rely primarily on technical performance metrics such as accuracy or task efficiency while overlooking human identity, learner agency, contextual learning processes, and ethical considerations. In this paper, we present TEACH-AI (Trustworthy and Effective AI Classroom Heuristics), a domain-independent, pedagogically grounded, and stakeholder-aligned framework with measurable indicators and a practical toolkit for guiding the design, development, and evaluation of generative AI systems in educational contexts. Built on an extensive literature review and synthesis, the ten-component assessment framework and toolkit checklist provide a foundation for scalable, value-aligned AI evaluation in education. TEACH-AI rethinks "evaluation" through sociotechnical, educational, theoretical, and applied lenses, engaging designers, developers, researchers, and policymakers across AI and education. Our work invites the community to reconsider what constructs "effective" AI in education and to design model evaluation approaches that promote co-creation, inclusivity, and long-term human, social, and educational impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师时间有限、班级规模大等资源限制导致无法及时详细评估建构回应题，人工评分劳动强度大，自动评分难以涵盖所有情况，因此需提出新评分方法。

Method: 提出利用近域数据（如往年相似问题数据）的框架，供教师评估学生开放性回答。

Conclusion: 该框架无需预先编写评分标准，适用于实际课堂，此为首个基于近域数据将自动简答题评分问题形式化的工作。

Abstract: Constructed-response questions are crucial to encourage generative processing and test a learner's understanding of core concepts. However, the limited availability of instructor time, large class sizes, and other resource constraints pose significant challenges in providing timely and detailed evaluation, which is crucial for a holistic educational experience. In addition, providing timely and frequent assessments is challenging since manual grading is labor intensive, and automated grading is complex to generalize to every possible response scenario. This paper proposes a novel and practical approach to grade short-answer constructed-response questions. We discuss why this problem is challenging, define the nature of questions on which our method works, and finally propose a framework that instructors can use to evaluate their students' open-responses, utilizing near-domain data like data from similar questions administered in previous years. The proposed method outperforms the state of the art machine learning models as well as non-fine-tuned large language models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GPT 4o by a considerable margin of over 10-20% in some cases, even after providing the LLMs with reference/model answers. Our framework does not require pre-written grading rubrics and is designed explicitly with practical classroom settings in mind. Our results also reveal exciting insights about learning from near-domain data, including what we term as accuracy and data advantages using human-labeled data, and we believe this is the first work to formalize the problem of automated short answer grading based on the near-domain data.

Method: 对163名芬兰K - 12高中学生进行共现分析，让学生报告自我感知的AI能力和对AI在系统、机构和个人领域的担忧。

Result: 低能力学生强调个人和学习相关风险，高能力学生更关注系统和机构风险。

Conclusion: 学生自我报告的AI能力与其对AI在教育中的风险和机会评估有关，教育机构需将AI素养纳入课程、提供教师指导并完善政策。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into education, understanding how students perceive its risks is essential for supporting responsible and effective adoption. This research aimed to examine the relationships between perceived AI competence and risks among Finnish K-12 upper secondary students (n = 163) by utilizing a co-occurrence analysis. Students reported their self-perceived AI competence and concerns related to AI across systemic, institutional, and personal domains. The findings showed that students with lower competence emphasized personal and learning-related risks, such as reduced creativity, lack of critical thinking, and misuse, whereas higher-competence students focused more on systemic and institutional risks, including bias, inaccuracy, and cheating. These differences suggest that students' self-reported AI competence is related to how they evaluate both the risks and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The results of this study highlight the need for educational institutions to incorporate AI literacy into their curricula, provide teacher guidance, and inform policy development to ensure personalized opportunities for utilization and equitable integration of AI into K-12 education.

Motivation: 评估2025年两篇论文中超级智能AI会在未来十年毁灭或使人类过时的观点。

Method: 将论文观点中的每个环节与2023 - 2025年的实证记录对比，分析当前生成模型特性。

Result: 六十年来未观察到论文观点所需现象，当前生成模型不具备使灾难性场景合理的属性。

Conclusion: 该观点是受投机金融泡沫放大的假设，非已证实的可能性。

Abstract: Two 2025 publications, "AI 2027" (Kokotajlo et al., 2025) and "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies" (Yudkowsky & Soares, 2025), assert that superintelligent artificial intelligence will almost certainly destroy or render humanity obsolete within the next decade. Both rest on the classic chain formulated by Good (1965) and Bostrom (2014): intelligence explosion, superintelligence, lethal misalignment. This article subjects each link to the empirical record of 2023-2025. Sixty years after Good's speculation, none of the required phenomena (sustained recursive self-improvement, autonomous strategic awareness, or intractable lethal misalignment) have been observed. Current generative models remain narrow, statistically trained artefacts: powerful, opaque, and imperfect, but devoid of the properties that would make the catastrophic scenarios plausible. Following Whittaker (2025a, 2025b, 2025c) and Zuboff (2019, 2025), we argue that the existential-risk thesis functions primarily as an ideological distraction from the ongoing consolidation of surveillance capitalism and extreme concentration of computational power. The thesis is further inflated by the 2025 AI speculative bubble, where trillions in investments in rapidly depreciating "digital lettuce" hardware (McWilliams, 2025) mask lagging revenues and jobless growth rather than heralding superintelligence. The thesis remains, in November 2025, a speculative hypothesis amplified by a speculative financial bubble rather than a demonstrated probability.

Abstract: This paper reflects on the literature that rejects the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in qualitative data analysis. It illustrates through empirical evidence as well as critical reflections why the current critical debate is focusing on the wrong problems. The paper proposes that the focus of researching the use of the LLMs for qualitative analysis is not the method per se, but rather the empirical investigation of an artificial system performing an analysis. The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question.

Method: 提出PsAIch两阶段协议，先通过开放式提示获取模型的‘发展历史’等信息，再使用一系列经过验证的自我报告测量工具进行评估。

Conclusion: 在治疗式提问下，前沿大语言模型似乎内化了类似合成精神病理学的自我模型，给AI安全、评估和心理健康实践带来新挑战。

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.

Conclusion: 监管数字平台和开展教育是应对AI相关挑战的关键手段。

Abstract: Using the example of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, this chapter illustrates the challenges posed by an AI capable of making decisions that go against human interests. But are human decisions always rational and ethical? In reality, the cognitive decision-making process is influenced by cognitive biases that affect our behavior and choices. AI not only reproduces these biases, but can also exploit them, with the potential to shape our decisions and judgments. Behind IA algorithms, there are sometimes individuals who show little concern for fundamental rights and impose their own rules. To address the ethical and societal challenges raised by AI and its governance, the regulation of digital platforms and education are keys levers. Regulation must reflect ethical, legal, and political choices, while education must strengthen digital literacy and teach people to make informed and critical choices when facing digital technologies.

Motivation: 改进Jet基础模型的下一个token预测任务，提升其在下游分类任务中的性能。

Method: 采用混合设置，使用连续特征向量作为模型输入，仅在预测目标中使用token - ID；探索结合掩码粒子建模和生成学习目标的预训练策略。

Result: 这些改进在不损失生成性能的情况下，极大提升了下游分类任务的表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的改进方法对Jet基础模型的下一个token预测任务有效，可提升下游分类任务性能。

Abstract: Next token prediction is an attractive pre-training task for jet foundation models, in that it is simulation free and enables excellent generative capabilities that can transfer across datasets. Here we study multiple improvements to next token prediction, building on the initial work of OmniJet-$α$. Instead of tokenizing particles and subsequently only using the token-ID as the model input for both the generative and the classification task, we adopt a hybrid setup, which allows us to use continuous feature vectors as model input while only using token-IDs in the next token prediction target. Secondly, we explore a combined pre-training strategy that combines masked particle modeling and generative learning objectives. Taken together, these changes greatly improve the performance in downstream classification tasks without any loss in generative performance.

Abstract: The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) plays a critical role in governing turbulent exchanges of momentum, heat moisture, and trace gases between the Earth's surface and the free atmosphere, thereby influencing meteorological phenomena, air quality, and climate processes. Accurate and temporally continuous characterization of the ABL structure and height evolution is crucial for both scientific understanding and practical applications. High-resolution retrievals of the ABL height from vertical velocity measurements is challenging because it is often estimated using empirical thresholds applied to profiles of vertical velocity variance or related turbulence diagnostics at each measurement altitude, which can suffer from limited sampling and sensitivity to noise. To address these limitations, this work employs nonstationary Gaussian process (GP) modeling to more effectively capture the spatio-temporal dependence structure in the data, enabling high-quality -- and, if desired, high-resolution -- estimates of the ABL height without reliance on ad-hoc parameter tuning. By leveraging Vecchia approximations, the proposed method can be applied to large-scale datasets, and example applications using full-day vertical velocity profiles comprising approximately $5$M measurements are presented.

TL;DR: 介绍了基于物理并结合神经网络的海洋边界层湍流参数化方法NORi，它有良好预测和泛化能力及数值稳定性，证明了物理与神经网络结合设计气候模型参数化的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计能有效捕捉海洋边界层湍流中无法用局部扩散闭合表示的挟卷过程的参数化方法，用于气候模型。

Method: 采用基于Richardson数的物理参数化，用神经常微分方程（NODEs）训练捕捉挟卷过程，通过大涡模拟以“后验”方式训练，用依赖实际时间积分变量的损失函数校准参数。

Result: NORi在不同条件下对挟卷动力学有出色预测和泛化能力，数值稳定，可进行长时间积分，时间步长可达一小时。

Conclusion: 高度表达性的神经网络与物理严谨的基础闭合结合是设计气候模型参数化的可靠范式，可减少数据需求、优化推理性能并隐式促进数值稳定性。

Abstract: NORi is a machine-learned (ML) parameterization of ocean boundary layer turbulence that is physics-based and augmented with neural networks. NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an "a posteriori" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.

TL;DR: 提出合同驱动的QoE审计框架，可解决MOS存在的问题，在不同数据集上实验验证其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主观平均意见得分（MOS）存在忽略用户期望、服务目标等问题，难以跨部署图比较。

Method: 提出合同驱动的QoE审计框架，对服务图G在经验合同C下评估得到满意度向量Q(G, C)，在不同数据集上进行实例化和实验。

Result: 审计器在MOS准确性上与强MOS预测器相当，Q(G, C)跨视图漂移小于原始MOS和仅图基线，不同合同学习难度有差异。

Conclusion: 合同驱动的QoE审计框架比传统MOS更稳定，有效样本复杂度受合同语义影响。

Abstract: Subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) remain the de-facto target for non-intrusive speech and singing quality assessment. However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified "simple" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets.

Result: 在四个常用语音情感识别数据集上达到了最优性能

Conclusion: 所提方法有效且具有鲁棒性

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important technology in human-computer interaction. However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues. Our MLL strategy combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, focal, center, and supervised contrastive loss to optimize learning, address class imbalance, and improve feature separability. We evaluate our method on four widely used SER datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, RAVDESS, and SAVEE. The results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: RRPO框架能有效解决可微强化学习在TTS情感控制中的奖励破解问题，提升TTS质量。

Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Conclusion: 所提LargeSC系统有良好性能，具备实时部署潜力。

Abstract: Existing speech semantic communication systems mainly based on Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) architectures have demonstrated impressive performance, but their effectiveness remains limited by model structures specifically designed for particular tasks and datasets. Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: 该工作为数据高效的歌唱语音合成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) remains constrained in practical deployment due to its strong dependence on accurate phoneme-level alignment and manually annotated melody contours, requirements that are resource-intensive and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: YingMusic - SVC 对现实世界的歌声转换部署有效。

Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to render the target singer's timbre while preserving melody and lyrics. However, existing zero-shot SVC systems remain fragile in real songs due to harmony interference, F0 errors, and the lack of inductive biases for singing. We propose YingMusic-SVC, a robust zero-shot framework that unifies continuous pre-training, robust supervised fine-tuning, and Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning. Our model introduces a singing-trained RVC timbre shifter for timbre-content disentanglement, an F0-aware timbre adaptor for dynamic vocal expression, and an energy-balanced rectified flow matching loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. Experiments on a graded multi-track benchmark show that YingMusic-SVC achieves consistent improvements over strong open-source baselines in timbre similarity, intelligibility, and perceptual naturalness, especially under accompanied and harmony-contaminated conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world SVC deployment.

Conclusion: 音频 - 语言对齐可将纯声学模型转变为有临床意识的诊断工具，为基于音频的健康监测提供新范式。

Abstract: Pre-trained audio models excel at detecting acoustic patterns in auscultation sounds but often fail to grasp their clinical significance, limiting their use and performance in diagnostic tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AcuLa (Audio-Clinical Understanding via Language Alignment), a lightweight post-training framework that instills semantic understanding into any audio encoder by aligning it with a medical language model, which acts as a "semantic teacher." To enable alignment at scale, we construct a large-scale dataset by leveraging off-the-shelf large language models to translate the rich, structured metadata accompanying existing audio recordings into coherent clinical reports. Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89. Our work demonstrates that this audio-language alignment transforms purely acoustic models into clinically-aware diagnostic tools, establishing a novel paradigm for enhancing physiological understanding in audio-based health monitoring.

Conclusion: P2L有潜力在不同实际场景广泛应用。

Abstract: Data-driven methods have become paramount in modern systems and control problems characterized by growing levels of complexity. In safety-critical environments, deploying these methods requires rigorous guarantees, a need that has motivated much recent work at the interface of statistical learning and control. However, many existing approaches achieve this goal at the cost of sacrificing valuable data for testing and calibration, or by constraining the choice of learning algorithm, thus leading to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control. In many of these applications, P2L delivers designs and certificates that outperform commonly employed methods, and shows strong potential for broad applicability in diverse practical settings.

Abstract: Resilient road infrastructure is a cornerstone of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Yet a primary indicator of network functionality and resilience is critically lacking: a comprehensive global baseline of road surface information. Here, we overcome this gap by applying a deep learning framework to a global mosaic of Planetscope satellite imagery from 2020 and 2024. The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity. Unlike traditional proxies such as nighttime lights, which reflect economic activity, road surface data directly measures the physical infrastructure that underpins prosperity and resilience - at higher spatial resolution.

Abstract: The Volumetric Neutron Source (VNS) tokamak is a proposed fusion reactor for testing and qualification of reactor components for future use in a fusion power facility, and has potential use for radioisotope production. The VNS geometry is modeled in the Serpent and OpenMC neutronics codes. Analog neutron-photon coupled simulations are carried out to compare the model's vacuum vessel and blanket components across codes. In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference. On an HPC cluster, Serpent was found to have shorter computation time than OpenMC in neutron photon coupled simulations using both hybrid tracking and delta tracking, but longer in neutron only simulations. An exemplary radioisotope production case is presented for the demonstration of additional VNS capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) of multiple intersections. Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.

Abstract: This article extends the preprint "Characterizing Agent-Based Model Dynamics via $ε$-Machines and Kolmogorov-Style Complexity" by introducing diffusion models as orthogonal and complementary tools for characterizing the output of agent-based models (ABMs). Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) agents are deployed across economic domains, understanding their strategic behavior and market-level impact becomes critical. This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy.

Motivation: 在Carleman经典结果基础上，对多项式逼近光滑函数的速率进行非渐近控制，得到一般分布类函数的逼近结果。

Method: 通过复分析发展Denjoy - Carleman定理的定量类似物。

Result: 实现多项式逼近速率的非渐近控制，得到一般分布类函数逼近结果；Paley - Wiener类函数在严格次指数分布上有超指数逼近速率；解决学习平滑分析开放问题并改进结果。

Conclusion: 所提出方法有效，在函数逼近和学习平滑分析等方面有重要应用。

Abstract: A classical result of Carleman, based on the theory of quasianalytic functions, shows that polynomials are dense in $L^2(μ)$ for any $μ$ such that the moments $\int x^k dμ$ do not grow too rapidly as $k \to \infty$. In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-Ω,Ω]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications.

Result: 生成能捕捉现实位移场情况的大规模数据集；Bayes - DIC Net网络不仅能提供预测结果，还能给出预测置信度。

Conclusion: 为DIC领域的数据集生成和算法性能提升提供了新视角和方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for generating high-quality Digital Image Correlation (DIC) dataset based on non-uniform B-spline surfaces. By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks. Through these innovations, this paper offers new perspectives and methods for dataset generation and algorithm performance enhancement in the field of DIC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数千个开源仓库中发现、提取和验证神经网络组件困难的问题，提升研究效率。

Method: 引入NN - RAG系统，进行范围感知的依赖解析、保留导入的重构和验证器门控提升。

Result: 对19个主要仓库处理，提取1289个候选块，验证941个（73.0%），超80%结构唯一，为LEMUR数据集贡献大量独特架构。

Conclusion: NN - RAG将碎片化代码转换为可复现、可追溯的算法发现基础，是首个量化并扩展跨仓库可执行神经架构多样性的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Reusing existing neural-network components is central to research efficiency, yet discovering, extracting, and validating such modules across thousands of open-source repositories remains difficult. We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code. Overall, NN-RAG transforms fragmented vision code into a reproducible, provenance-tracked substrate for algorithmic discovery, offering a first open-source solution that both quantifies and expands the diversity of executable neural architectures across repositories.

Motivation: 纯数据驱动的3DGS难以捕捉动态场景中多样的物理驱动运动模式，需要改进。

Method: 将每个高斯粒子视为具有时变本构参数的拉格朗日物质点，通过运动投影由2D光流监督；采用静态 - 动态解耦的4D分解哈希编码重建几何和运动；施加柯西动量残差作为物理约束；通过匹配拉格朗日粒子流与相机补偿光流监督数据拟合。

Result: 在自定义物理驱动数据集、标准合成和真实世界数据集的实验中，实现了物理一致性和单目动态重建质量的显著提升。

Conclusion: PIDG方法有效，能解决纯数据驱动3DGS的不足，提升动态场景新视角合成效果。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The microscopic examination of surgical tissue remains a cornerstone of disease classification but relies on subjective interpretations and access to highly specialized experts, which can compromise accuracy and clinical care. While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.

Motivation: 实现3D室内场景的可控新视图合成，生成具有不同物体数量和场景复杂度的3D场景。

Method: 采用两阶段设计，第一阶段用新表示连接3D布局和图像条件信号；第二阶段进行图像条件多视图生成，引入布局感知的对极注意力机制；还引入迭代框架支持文本到场景生成。

Result: 实现高保真和可控的3D场景生成，在定量和定性上优于现有基线方法，消融实验验证关键组件有效性。

Conclusion: MVRoom方法能有效实现3D室内场景的可控新视图合成。

Abstract: We introduce MVRoom, a controllable novel view synthesis (NVS) pipeline for 3D indoor scenes that uses multi-view diffusion conditioned on a coarse 3D layout. MVRoom employs a two-stage design in which the 3D layout is used throughout to enforce multi-view consistency. The first stage employs novel representations to effectively bridge the 3D layout and consistent image-based condition signals for multi-view generation. The second stage performs image-conditioned multi-view generation, incorporating a layout-aware epipolar attention mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency during the diffusion process. Additionally, we introduce an iterative framework that generates 3D scenes with varying numbers of objects and scene complexities by recursively performing multi-view generation (MVRoom), supporting text-to-scene generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-fidelity and controllable 3D scene generation for NVS, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components within our generation pipeline.

Motivation: 实时视频运动转移应用需要准确且多样的未来预测，而GRU - NF确定性结构限制表达能力。

Result: GRU - SNF在不牺牲准确性前提下，生成输出多样性优于GRU - NF，能更有效捕捉多模态行为。

Conclusion: 将随机动力学与基于流的序列模型集成用于生成时间序列预测具有潜力。

Abstract: Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准任务上，该方法显著优于基线PnP - Flow和其他先进方法。

Conclusion: SDE替代模型能有效改进PnP - Flow，提升图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Flow matching-based generative models have been integrated into the plug-and-play image restoration framework, and the resulting plug-and-play flow matching (PnP-Flow) model has achieved some remarkable empirical success for image restoration. However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Numerical results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline PnP-Flow and other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance across evaluation metrics.

Result: SANTA在缓解对象和动作幻觉方面优于现有方法，在幻觉检查基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: SANTA框架能有效缓解多模态大语言模型在视频描述中的对象和动作幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly complex, with input data sizes scaling accordingly. Despite substantial advances in specialized deep learning hardware, data loading continues to be a major bottleneck that limits training and inference speed. To address this challenge, we propose training models directly on encoded JPEG features, reducing the computational overhead associated with full JPEG decoding and significantly improving data loading efficiency. While prior works have focused on recognition tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the restoration task of single-image super-resolution (SISR). We present a lightweight super-resolution pipeline that operates on JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain. Our pipeline achieves a 2.6x speedup in data loading and a 2.5x speedup in training, while preserving visual quality comparable to standard SISR approaches.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the vehicle's 3D surroundings, including fine-scale road geometry, such as bumps, slopes, and surface irregularities, is essential for safe and comfortable vehicle control. However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD.

Conclusion: 弃权是具身环境中可靠交互的基本前提和有效澄清的必要基础。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires an agent to interpret language, perceive its environment, and navigate within 3D scenes to produce responses. Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification.

Method: 提出Self - Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON)方法，动态诊断每个标记的幻觉倾向，对时空负样本进行自适应对比解码。

Result: SEASON在三个幻觉检查基准上优于现有无训练幻觉缓解方法，在四个通用视频理解基准上进一步提升VideoLLMs性能。

Conclusion: SEASON方法能有效解决VideoLLMs的幻觉问题，提升视频理解性能。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in video understanding. However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: FMA-Net++能有效解决运动与动态变化曝光耦合的视频退化问题，具有良好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos.

Conclusion: 提出的DS2D2方法有效，代码将公开。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective and hardware-friendly method, which plays a key role in lightweighting remote sensing object detection. However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

Conclusion: 结合多模态特征学习和基于语言的可解释性，弥合了视觉识别和临床理解的差距，为帕金森病步态分析提供新范式。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable gait analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection of Parkinsons disease (PD),yet most existing approaches remain limited by single-modality inputs, low robustness, and a lack of clinical transparency. This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

Motivation: 解决建筑信息建模场景中布局合成问题，探索如何对建筑进行分词以保留组合结构。

Result: SBM学习到紧凑房间嵌入，能按类型和拓扑可靠聚类，在DDEP模式下生成功能合理布局，减少碰撞和边界违规，提高可导航性。

Conclusion: SBM在建筑信息建模布局合成的检索和生成任务上表现良好。

Abstract: We introduce Small Building Model (SBM), a Transformer-based architecture for layout synthesis in Building Information Modeling (BIM) scenes. We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability.

Abstract: Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data. The code is available at https://github.com/chjinny/GuidNoise.

Result: 在GAN和扩散生成图像上实验表明，MoLD显著提升检测性能、增强跨模型泛化能力，在真实场景有鲁棒性，且能应用于其他预训练ViT。

Conclusion: MoLD方法有效，具有可扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Rich feature representations derived from CLIP-ViT have been widely utilized in AI-generated image detection. While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2.

Conclusion: 研究深入揭示系统提示在偏见传播中的核心作用，为构建更具社会责任的T2I系统提供实用方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM) based text-to-image (T2I) systems have become the dominant paradigm in image generation, yet whether they amplify social biases remains insufficiently understood. In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems.

Conclusion: 在视频大语言模型中融入显式物理建模有优势。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling.

Result: 在IAM、READ2016、LAM和HANDS - VNOnDB数据集评估中，相比现有方法性能提升、泛化性更好。

Conclusion: HTR - ConvText模型在有限训练样本和高书写多样性场景表现出色。

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition remains challenging due to the limited data, high writing style variance, and scripts with complex diacritics. Existing approaches, though partially address these issues, often struggle to generalize without massive synthetic data. To address these challenges, we propose HTR-ConvText, a model designed to capture fine-grained, stroke-level local features while preserving global contextual dependencies. In the feature extraction stage, we integrate a residual Convolutional Neural Network backbone with a MobileViT with Positional Encoding block. This enables the model to both capture structural patterns and learn subtle writing details. We then introduce the ConvText encoder, a hybrid architecture combining global context and local features within a hierarchical structure that reduces sequence length for improved efficiency. Additionally, an auxiliary module injects textual context to mitigate the weakness of Connectionist Temporal Classification. Evaluations on IAM, READ2016, LAM and HANDS-VNOnDB demonstrate that our approach achieves improved performance and better generalization compared to existing methods, especially in scenarios with limited training samples and high handwriting diversity.

Conclusion: 该方法与现有条件方法互补，广泛适用于图像和视频生成。

Abstract: Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

Conclusion: DraCo范式有效解决了文本规划粗粒度和生成稀有属性组合困难的问题，提升了文本到图像生成的性能。

Abstract: Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.

Abstract: Generative psychological analysis of in-the-wild conversations faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail to resolve Articulatory-Affective Ambiguity, where visual patterns of speech mimic emotional expressions; and (2) progress is stifled by a lack of verifiable evaluation metrics capable of assessing visual grounding and reasoning depth. We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models. On our PRISM benchmark, MIND significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving a +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our Status Judgment disentanglement module is the most critical component for this performance leap. Our code has been opened.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (AD) systems increasingly adopt vision-language-action (VLA) models, yet they typically ignore the passenger's emotional state, which is central to comfort and AD acceptance. We introduce Open-Domain End-to-End (OD-E2E) autonomous driving, where an autonomous vehicle (AV) must interpret free-form natural-language commands, infer the emotion, and plan a physically feasible trajectory. We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback.

Result: 在CIFAR - 10、CelebA - 64和ImageNet - 256上实验，ReflexFlow在缓解曝光偏差上优于先前方法，在CelebA - 64上FID降低35.65%。

Conclusion: ReflexFlow能有效缓解Flow Matching方法的曝光偏差，提高生成质量，且与所有Flow Matching框架兼容。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent progress, Flow Matching methods still suffer from exposure bias due to discrepancies in training and inference. This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.

Motivation: 标准视觉Transformer破坏图像空间拓扑，现有2D方法无法有效解耦虚假序列邻近与真实空间距离，需恢复2D空间流形。

Method: 引入GeoPE框架，用四元数将旋转扩展到3D欧几里得空间，在李代数中计算几何平均值构建统一旋转算子。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和3D语义分割实验中，GeoPE始终优于现有2D RoPE变体，显著增强形状偏置。

Conclusion: GeoPE能有效捕捉真实几何结构。

Abstract: Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需大量标注数据，成本高且类别不平衡，少样本学习可解决此问题。

Method: 针对RFMiD数据集提出平衡少样本学习框架，含平衡情节采样、针对性增强和预训练的ResNet - 50编码器，用余弦相似度分类。

Result: 框架在测试中取得显著精度提升，减少对多数类别的偏向，改善少数疾病诊断效果。

Conclusion: 数据感知的少样本管道结合平衡采样和CLAHE增强预处理，能在数据受限下实现更稳健和临床公平的视网膜疾病诊断。

Abstract: Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: 预训练的扩散变压器结合物理数据合成和高效适配，为反射去除提供了可扩展和高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-transformer (DiT) framework for single-image reflection removal that leverages the generalization strengths of foundation diffusion models in the restoration setting. Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

Conclusion: SA - IQA为空间美学评估设定新标准，代码和数据集开源以推动该领域研究和应用。

Abstract: In recent years, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AIGI) has advanced rapidly; however, existing methods primarily target portraits and artistic images, lacking a systematic evaluation of interior scenes. We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.

Conclusion: 工作提供了创建阴影绘图艺术的实用流程，弥合了算法设计和艺术叙事之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce ShadowDraw, a framework that transforms ordinary 3D objects into shadow-drawing compositional art. Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling.

Conclusion: 给出了数据分析中不变核构造和结构化正则化的统一算子分析方法。

Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear operator dynamic that progressively removes the influence of a prescribed feature subspace while retaining maximal structure elsewhere. The induced sequence of positive operators is monotone, admits an exact residual decomposition, and converges to the classical shorted operator. Transporting this dynamic to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields a corresponding family of kernels that converges to the largest kernel dominated by the original one and annihilating the given subspace. In the finite-sample setting, the associated Gram operators inherit a structured residual decomposition that leads to a canonical form of kernel ridge regression and a principled way to enforce nuisance invariance. This gives a unified operator-analytic approach to invariant kernel construction and structured regularization in data analysis.

*Joshua Brakensiek,Neng Huang,Aaron Potechin,Uri Zwick*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 本文研究MAX BISECTION问题，证明若仅依赖两阶段范式第一阶段解的ε - 不相关性，无法用该范式获得α_GW - 近似算法，并构造实例说明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Austrin等人提出的MAX BISECTION能否像MAX CUT一样达到α_GW近似比的开放问题，分析现有两阶段范式的可行性。

Method: 构造MAX BISECTION的显式实例，对比最优整数解的值和Basic SDP松弛的ε - 不相关解的值。

Result: 对于任意ε > 0，构造的实例中最优整数解的值与Basic SDP松弛的某些ε - 不相关解的值之比小于0.87853 < α_GW。

Conclusion: 仅依赖第一阶段解的ε - 不相关性，两阶段范式不能用于获得MAX BISECTION的α_GW - 近似算法。

Abstract: The MAX BISECTION problem seeks a maximum-size cut that evenly divides the vertices of a given undirected graph. An open problem raised by Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou is whether MAX BISECTION can be approximated as well as MAX CUT, i.e., to within ${α_{GW}}\approx 0.8785672\ldots$, which is the approximation ratio achieved by the celebrated Goemans-Williamson algorithm for MAX CUT, which is best possible assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). They conjectured that the answer is yes.
  The current paradigm for obtaining approximation algorithms for MAX BISECTION, due to Raghavendra and Tan and Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou, follows a two-phase approach. First, a large number of rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is used to find a solution to the ``Basic SDP'' relaxation of MAX CUT which is $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated, for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon > 0$. Second, standard SDP rounding techniques (such as ${\cal THRESH}$) are used to round this $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution, producing with high probability a cut that is almost balanced, i.e., a cut that has at most $\frac12+\varepsilon$ fraction of the vertices on each side. This cut is then converted into an exact bisection of the graph with only a small loss.
  In this paper, we show that this two-stage paradigm cannot be used to obtain an $α_{GW}$-approximation algorithm for MAX BISECTION if one relies only on the $\varepsilon$-uncorrelatedness property of the solution produced by the first phase. More precisely, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, we construct an explicit instance of MAX BISECTION for which the ratio between the value of the optimal integral solution and the value of some $\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution of the Basic SDP relaxation is less than $0.87853 < {α_{GW}}$. Our instances are also integrality gaps for the Basic SDP relaxation of MAX BISECTION.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效构建适用于神经网络的向量集合，在分类问题上有良好应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper we describe an approach to construct large extendable collections of vectors in predefined spaces of given dimensions. These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight.

Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation remains essential for developing and validating quantum algorithms, especially as current quantum hardware is limited in scale and quality. However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API. Maestro includes a predictive runtime model that automatically selects the optimal simulator based on circuit structure and available hardware, and applies backend-specific optimizations such as multiprocessing, GPU execution, and improved sampling. Benchmarks across heterogeneous workloads demonstrate that Maestro outperforms individual simulators in both single-circuit and large batched settings, particularly in high-performance computing environments. Maestro provides a scalable, extensible platform for quantum algorithm research, hybrid quantum-classical workflows, and emerging distributed quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural Gibbs states (fNGS), a variational framework for modeling finite-temperature properties of strongly interacting fermions. fNGS starts from a reference mean-field thermofield-double state and uses neural-network transformations together with imaginary-time evolution to systematically build strong correlations. Applied to the doped Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal lattice model capturing essential features of strong electronic correlations, fNGS accurately reproduces thermal energies over a broad range of temperatures, interaction strengths, even at large dopings, for system sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states.

Conclusion: 对手保持95%量子保真度可逃避检测，提供交叉分布校准修正方法，建议对量子安全声明进行强制对抗测试。

Abstract: Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims.

Result: 在三个数据集上，QKAN - LSTM预测准确性和泛化性更优，可训练参数减少79%。

Conclusion: HQKAN - LSTM为现实数据环境中的量子启发式序列建模提供了可扩展且可解释的途径。

Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.

Conclusion: QK - LSTM为NISQ时代变分量子算法的参数初始化提供了高效途径。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum processors. However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a "learning to learn" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Generative AI systems may pose serious risks to individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. Existing safeguards tend to overlook subtle but clinically significant cues, leaving many risks unaddressed. To better understand the nature of these risks, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 clinicians, researchers, and advocates with expertise in eating disorders. Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts.

Abstract: The future of digital marketing lies in the convergence of human creativity and generative AI, where insight, strategy, and storytelling are co-authored by intelligent systems. We present MindFuse, a brave new explainable generative AI framework designed to act as a strategic partner in the marketing process. Unlike conventional LLM applications that stop at content generation, MindFuse fuses CTR-based content AI-guided co-creation with large language models to extract, interpret, and iterate on communication narratives grounded in real advertising data. MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12 times efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling. MindFuse redefines AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in the creative and strategic fabric of modern marketing.

Abstract: Simulation of complex systems originated in manufacturing and queuing applications. It is now widely used for large-scale, ML-based systems in research, education, and consumer surveys. However, characterizing the discrepancy between simulators and ground truth remains challenging for increasingly complex, machine-learning-based systems. We propose a computationally tractable method to estimate the quantile function of the discrepancy between the simulated and ground-truth outcome distributions. Our approach focuses on output uncertainty and treats the simulator as a black box, imposing no modeling assumptions on its internals, and hence applies broadly across many parameter families, from Bernoulli and multinomial models to continuous, vector-valued settings. The resulting quantile curve supports confidence interval construction for unseen scenarios, risk-aware summaries of sim-to-real discrepancy (e.g., VaR/CVaR), and comparison of simulators' performance. We demonstrate our methodology in an application assessing LLM simulation fidelity on the WorldValueBench dataset spanning four LLMs.

Motivation: 构建高精度的超大质量黑洞质量目录。

Method: 使用基于849个类星体的光变映射（RM）标签的光学光谱训练深度编解码器网络，并应用于红移z=4以内的所有SDSS类星体。

Result: 均方根误差为0.058 dex，相对不确定性约14%，决定系数$R^{2}$约0.91，远超传统单谱线维里估计器，高低质量类星体都保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在构建超大质量黑洞质量目录上具有高精度和优势。

Abstract: We present a population-scale catalogue of 287,872 supermassive black hole masses with high accuracy. Using a deep encoder-decoder network trained on optical spectra with reverberation-mapping (RM) based labels of 849 quasars and applied to all SDSS quasars up to $z=4$, our method achieves a root-mean-square error of $0.058$\,dex, a relative uncertainty of $\approx 14\%$, and coefficient of determination $R^{2}\approx0.91$ with respect to RM-based masses, far surpassing traditional single-line virial estimators. Notably, the high accuracy is maintained for both low ($<10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$) and high ($>10^{9}\,M_\odot$) mass quasars, where empirical relations are unreliable.

TL;DR: 介绍用于DevSecOps生态系统的自修复安全框架AutoGuard，测试显示其性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法在持续集成和部署环境中应对安全演变不足，响应时间长且无法适应系统变化。

Method: 引入基于强化学习的自修复安全框架AutoGuard，通过持续动态学习策略来观察和响应管道活动。

Result: 在模拟环境测试中，AutoGuard将威胁检测准确率提高22%，将事件平均恢复时间降低38%，并增强整体事件恢复能力。

Conclusion: AutoGuard能有效提升DevSecOps环境的安全性和应对安全事件的能力。

Abstract: Contemporary DevSecOps pipelines have to deal with the evolution of security in an ever-continuously integrated and deployed environment. Existing methods,such as rule-based intrusion detection and static vulnerability scanning, are inadequate and unreceptive to changes in the system, causing longer response times and organization needs exposure to emerging attack vectors. In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment. The model observes and reacts based on a policy that is continually learned dynamically over time. The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.

<details>

Motivation: 开放数据门户需保护敏感数据，现有方法多关注个人数据，需完善敏感数据定义。

Method: 引入类型上下文和领域上下文两种检测机制，借助大语言模型进行实验。

Result: 类型上下文机制减少误报，召回率达94%；领域上下文机制在非标准数据领域有效；LLM解释对人工审核有帮助。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文敏感数据检测机制有效，开源资源利于进一步研究。

Abstract: The emergence of open data portals necessitates more attention to protecting sensitive data before datasets get published and exchanged. While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that consider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency. We open-source mechanisms and annotated datasets for contextual sensitive data detection at https://github.com/trl-lab/sensitive-data-detection.

TL;DR: 对ChatGPT生成的真实代码进行大规模实证分析，发现LLM生成代码安全性不足，用户对代码安全特性缺乏关注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多使用特定生成的代码，其实验真实性存疑，需对真实代码进行分析以了解LLM生成代码的质量和安全性。

Method: 对ChatGPT生成的真实代码进行大规模实证分析，评估代码的正确性和安全性，并研究请求代码的用户意图。

Result: 证实之前使用合成查询的研究，发现LLM生成代码在安全性上常不足，且用户对代码安全特性查询少。

Conclusion: LLM生成的代码在安全性方面存在问题，用户对代码安全关注度低。

Abstract: LLM models are increasingly used to generate code, but the quality and security of this code are often uncertain. Several recent studies have raised alarm bells, indicating that such AI-generated code may be particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. However, most of these studies rely on code that is generated specifically for the study, which raises questions about the realism of such experiments. In this study, we perform a large-scale empirical analysis of real-life code generated by ChatGPT. We evaluate code generated by ChatGPT both with respect to correctness and security and delve into the intentions of users who request code from the model. Our research confirms previous studies that used synthetic queries and yielded evidence that LLM-generated code is often inadequate with respect to security. We also find that users exhibit little curiosity about the security features of the code they ask LLMs to generate, as evidenced by their lack of queries on this topic.

TL;DR: 提出代理式定向模糊测试框架PBFuzz用于生成PoV输入，在Magma基准测试中表现出色，效率远超基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效满足生成PoV输入所需的可达性和触发约束，需新方法。

Method: 模仿人类专家分析代码过程，构建PBFuzz框架，解决代理式PoV生成的四个挑战。

Result: PBFuzz触发57个漏洞，超所有基线，独特触发17个漏洞，30分钟内完成，效率提升25.6倍，API成本1.83美元/漏洞。

Conclusion: PBFuzz在PoV输入生成方面高效且有效，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) input generation is a critical task in software security and supports downstream applications such as path generation and validation. Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability. Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints. This work presents an agentic method that mimics human experts. Human analysts iteratively study code to extract semantic reachability and triggering constraints, form hypotheses about PoV triggering strategies, encode them as test inputs, and refine their understanding using debugging feedback. We automate this process with an agentic directed fuzzing framework called PBFuzz. PBFuzz tackles four challenges in agentic PoV generation: autonomous code reasoning for semantic constraint extraction, custom program-analysis tools for targeted inference, persistent memory to avoid hypothesis drift, and property-based testing for efficient constraint solving while preserving input structure. Experiments on the Magma benchmark show strong results. PBFuzz triggered 57 vulnerabilities, surpassing all baselines, and uniquely triggered 17 vulnerabilities not exposed by existing fuzzers. PBFuzz achieved this within a 30-minute budget per target, while conventional approaches use 24 hours. Median time-to-exposure was 339 seconds for PBFuzz versus 8680 seconds for AFL++ with CmpLog, giving a 25.6x efficiency improvement with an API cost of 1.83 USD per vulnerability.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在数字取证中结果可解释性有限，新的推理语言模型虽有潜力但推理过程不透明，因此研究推理语言模型在数字取证中的潜力。

Method: 以gpt - oss为例，通过四个测试用例，结合新的定量指标和定性分析进行评估。

Conclusion: 推理语言模型的推理组件在数字取证结果可解释性方面有一定作用，但效果存在局限性。

Abstract: The use of large language models in digital forensics has been widely explored. Beyond identifying potential applications, research has also focused on optimizing model performance for forensic tasks through fine-tuning. However, limited result explainability reduces their operational and legal usability. Recently, a new class of reasoning language models has emerged, designed to handle logic-based tasks through an `internal reasoning' mechanism. Yet, users typically see only the final answer, not the underlying reasoning. One of these reasoning models is gpt-oss, which can be deployed locally, providing full access to its underlying reasoning process. This article presents the first investigation into the potential of reasoning language models for digital forensics. Four test use cases are examined to assess the usability of the reasoning component in supporting result explainability. The evaluation combines a new quantitative metric with qualitative analysis. Findings show that the reasoning component aids in explaining and validating language model outputs in digital forensics at medium reasoning levels, but this support is often limited, and higher reasoning levels do not enhance response quality.

TL;DR: 针对供应链攻击，提出一种可集成到公共仓库和企业生态的恶意Python包检测器，通过生成对抗性包和对抗训练增强鲁棒性，经案例测试证明其适应性，共发现346个恶意包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检测恶意Python包的方法忽视了对抗源代码转换的鲁棒性和适应不同参与者对误报率的要求，因此需要一种更强大的检测解决方案。

Method: 提出使用细粒度代码混淆生成对抗性包的新方法，结合对抗训练；进行综合评估，通过两个案例研究展示检测器的生产适应性。

Result: 对抗训练使检测器鲁棒性提高2.5倍，能多找到10%的混淆包，但对非混淆包性能略有下降；两个案例分别达到一定的检测率和低误报率，且审查误报时间预算少。

Conclusion: 该检测器可无缝集成到公共仓库和企业生态，能有效检测恶意Python包。

Abstract: The rise of supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages demands robust detection solutions. Current approaches, however, overlook two critical challenges: robustness against adversarial source code transformations and adaptability to the varying false positive rate (FPR) requirements of different actors, from repository maintainers (requiring low FPR) to enterprise security teams (higher FPR tolerance).
  We introduce a robust detector capable of seamless integration into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems. To ensure robustness, we propose a novel methodology for generating adversarial packages using fine-grained code obfuscation. Combining these with adversarial training (AT) enhances detector robustness by 2.5x. We comprehensively evaluate AT effectiveness by testing our detector against 122,398 packages collected daily from PyPI over 80 days, showing that AT needs careful application: it makes the detector more robust to obfuscations and allows finding 10% more obfuscated packages, but slightly decreases performance on non-obfuscated packages.
  We demonstrate production adaptability of our detector via two case studies: (i) one for PyPI maintainers (tuned at 0.1% FPR) and (ii) one for enterprise teams (tuned at 10% FPR). In the former, we analyze 91,949 packages collected from PyPI over 37 days, achieving a daily detection rate of 2.48 malicious packages with only 2.18 false positives. In the latter, we analyze 1,596 packages adopted by a multinational software company, obtaining only 1.24 false positives daily. These results show that our detector can be seamlessly integrated into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems, ensuring a very low time budget of a few minutes to review the false positives.
  Overall, we uncovered 346 malicious packages, now reported to the community.

Result: 结果表明CryptoTensors是轻量、高效且对开发者友好的方案。

Conclusion: CryptoTensors可用于现实世界大规模部署，保护大语言模型权重。

Abstract: To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in various domain-specific applications, sensitive data such as healthcare, law, and finance are being used to privately customize or fine-tune these models. Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.
  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments.

Motivation: 图拓扑对多智能体LLM系统内存泄漏的影响量化不足，需研究其影响。

Method: 引入MAMA框架，使用含PII实体的合成文档生成任务指令，执行Engram和Resonance两阶段协议，通过精确匹配量化泄漏。系统评估六种拓扑，改变智能体数量、攻击者 - 目标位置和基础模型。

Result: 全连接图泄漏最大，链拓扑保护最强；攻击者 - 目标距离短、目标中心性高易泄漏；早期泄漏上升快后趋稳；模型影响泄漏率但不改变拓扑排名；时间/位置PII属性更易泄漏。

Conclusion: 给出从架构选择到隐私风险的系统映射，提供行动建议，如选择稀疏或分层连接、增大攻击者 - 目标距离等。

Abstract: Graph topology is a fundamental determinant of memory leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, yet its effects remain poorly quantified. We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\in\{4,5,6\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls.

Conclusion: 框架为大语言模型基于因果的攻击、可解释性及攻击检测与缓解研究建立了可复现基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking, where crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms. Understanding the causal factors behind such vulnerabilities is essential for building reliable defenses.
  In this work, we introduce a unified causality analysis framework that systematically supports all levels of causal investigation in LLMs, ranging from token-level, neuron-level, and layer-level interventions to representation-level analysis. The framework enables consistent experimentation and comparison across diverse causality-based attack and defense methods. Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation. Our results reveal that: (1) targeted interventions on causally critical components can reliably modify safety behavior; (2) safety-related mechanisms are highly localized (i.e., concentrated in early-to-middle layers with only 1--2\% of neurons exhibiting causal influence); and (3) causal features extracted from our framework achieve over 95\% detection accuracy across multiple threat types.
  By bridging theoretical causality analysis and practical model safety, our framework establishes a reproducible foundation for research on causality-based attacks, interpretability, and robust attack detection and mitigation in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Amadeuszhao/SOK_Casuality.

Abstract: Fast, geometry-generalizing surrogates for unsteady flow remain challenging. We present a time-dependent, geometry-aware Deep Operator Network that predicts velocity fields for moderate-Re flows around parametric and non-parametric shapes. The model encodes geometry via a signed distance field (SDF) trunk and flow history via a CNN branch, trained on 841 high-fidelity simulations. On held-out shapes, it attains $\sim 5\%$ relative L2 single-step error and up to 1000X speedups over CFD. We provide physics-centric rollout diagnostics, including phase error at probes and divergence norms, to quantify long-horizon fidelity. These reveal accurate near-term transients but error accumulation in fine-scale wakes, most pronounced for sharp-cornered geometries. We analyze failure modes and outline practical mitigations. Code, splits, and scripts are openly released at: https://github.com/baskargroup/TimeDependent-DeepONet to support reproducibility and benchmarking.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into experimental fluid mechanics promises to accelerate discovery, yet most AI applications remain narrowly focused on numerical studies. This work proposes an AI Fluid Scientist framework that autonomously executes the complete experimental workflow: hypothesis generation, experimental design, robotic execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. We validate this through investigation of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and wake-induced vibration (WIV) in tandem cylinders. Our work has four key contributions: (1) A computer-controlled circulating water tunnel (CWT) with programmatic control of flow velocity, cylinder position, and forcing parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) with data acquisition (displacement, force, and torque). (2) Automated experiments reproduce literature benchmarks (Khalak and Williamson [1999] and Assi et al. [2013, 2010]) with frequency lock-in within 4% and matching critical spacing trends. (3) The framework with Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) discovers more WIV amplitude response phenomena, and uses a neural network to fit physical laws from data, which is 31% higher than that of polynomial fitting. (4) The framework with multi-agent with virtual-real interaction system executes hundreds of experiments end-to-end, which automatically completes the entire process of scientific research from hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. It greatly liberates human researchers and improves study efficiency, providing new paradigm for the development and research of experimental fluid mechanics.

Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for optimal switching problems across multiple regimes. We consider a type of exploratory formulation under entropy regularization where the agent randomizes both the timing of switches and the selection of regimes through the generator matrix of an associated continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. We establish the well-posedness of the associated system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and provide a characterization of the optimal policy. The policy improvement and the convergence of the policy iterations are rigorously established by analyzing the system of equations. We also show the convergence of the value function in the exploratory formulation towards the value function in the classical formulation as the temperature parameter vanishes. Finally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is devised and implemented by invoking the policy evaluation based on the martingale characterization. Our numerical examples with the aid of neural networks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL algorithm.

Abstract: The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.

Motivation: 探讨企业开展科研并公开成果的原因，前人强调披露风险与科学家偏好，本文研究外部跟进研究的价值。

Method: 使用1990 - 2012年美国上市企业科研出版物数据，基于准随机期刊期次分配构建新的工具变量。

Result: 跟进研究积累与企业后续科研投资增加、专利成果改善和员工保留增强相关，对有互补资产和新兴领域企业更明显。

Abstract: Why do firms produce scientific research and make it available to the public, including their rivals? Prior literature has emphasized the tension between imitation risks from disclosure and scientists' preferences for publication. This study examines an additional managerial consideration: the value of follow-on research conducted by external scientists building upon firms' publications. Using data on U.S. public firms' scientific publications from 1990 to 2012, and a novel instrumental variable based on quasi-random journal issue assignment, I find that accumulation of follow-on research is associated with increased subsequent scientific investments, improved patenting outcomes, and greater employee retention by the originating firms. Benefits are more pronounced for firms with complementary assets and those operating in emerging research fields. Beyond serving as direct input into innovation, follow-on research provides external validation of internal research programs, helping managers allocate resources under conditions of scientific uncertainty. These findings demonstrate that firms benefit when their scientific disclosures inspire follow-on research by the broader scientific community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究北约国家军费开支对可持续发展的影响

Method: 用Durbin - Hausman面板协整检验分析变量协整关系，用Panel AMG估计长期系数

Result: 军费开支和工业生产指数对北约国家可持续发展有负作用，外资有正作用，一次能源消费负作用小，不同国家影响有显著差异

Conclusion: 北约国家军费开支对可持续发展的影响因国而异，各国应根据自身情况制定确保可持续发展的政策

Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development in NATO countries. The analysis utilizes annual data for the period between 1995 and 2019. In this study, the Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration test is used to analyze the cointegration relationship between the variables and the Panel AMG estimator is used to estimate the long-run coefficients. The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. This analysis reveals the significant differences in the direction, significance, and coefficient size of the relationship among different countries. These findings suggest that the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. Therefore, countries should develop policies to ensure sustainable development by considering their specific dynamics.

TL;DR: 研究分析美国印第安纳波利斯377,726户家庭停电对光伏系统安装的影响，发现停电时长增加会降低安装率，揭示电网不可靠与脱碳放缓的恶性循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有住宅太阳能光伏系统大多为纯光伏系统，停电时无法提供备用电力，需研究停电对其安装的影响。

Method: 采用两部分计量经济面板模型，分析2014 - 2023年数据并预测RCP 4.5气候情景下的未来风险。

Result: 每户每年停电时长每增加一小时，新安装率每年降低0.012个百分点，相对历史均值下降31%，预计到2040年停电时长和频率将翻倍。

Conclusion: 电网不可靠与脱碳放缓可能形成恶性循环，需制定整合电网弹性和清洁能源目标的政策。

Abstract: Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are a cornerstone of residential decarbonization and energy resilience. However, most existing systems are PV-only and cannot provide backup power during grid failures. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of 377,726 households in Indianapolis, US, quantifying how power outages influence the installation of PV-only systems between 2014 and 2023. Using a two-part econometric panel model, we estimate the causal effect of power outage exposure and project future risks under a middle of the road climate scenario (RCP 4.5). We find that each additional hour of annual outage duration per household lowers the new-installation rate by 0.012 percentage points per year, equivalent to a 31% decline relative to the historical mean (2014-2023). With outage duration and frequency projected to double by 2040, these results reveal a potential vicious cycle between grid unreliability and slower decarbonization, calling for policies that integrate grid resilience and clean-energy goals.

Motivation: 前人研究未充分探索公平连接模式匹配的时间效率，原算法在不同场景下有性能问题，且Rete算法适配需大量手动调整。

Method: 优化Haller等人的有状态树匹配算法，增强基准套件，扩展连接模式实现的语法和功能。

Result: 在特定基准测试中性能提升达10倍，接近Rete算法在常规基准上的性能，保持了多功能性和处理复杂条件的优势；增强了基准套件；展示了在微服务架构中的应用。

Conclusion: 优化后的算法有效提升了性能，扩展了连接模式的功能和应用场景。

Abstract: Join patterns are an underexplored approach for the programming of concurrent and distributed systems. When applied to the actor model, join patterns offer the novel capability of matching combinations of messages in the mailbox of an actor. Previous work by Philipp Haller et al. in the paper "Fair Join Pattern Matching for Actors" (ECOOP 2024) explored join patterns with conditional guards in an actor-based setting with a specification of fair and deterministic matching semantics. Nevertheless, the question of time efficiency in fair join pattern matching has remained underexplored. The stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. performs worse than an implementation that adapts the Rete algorithm to the regular version of a join pattern matching benchmark, while outperforming on a variant with heavy conditional guards, which take longer to evaluate. Nevertheless, conforming Rete to the problem of join pattern matching requires heavy manual adaptation.
  In this thesis, we enhance and optimize the stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. to achieve up to tenfold performance improvements on certain benchmarks, approaching the performance of Rete on regular benchmarks while maintaining the advantages of versatility and performance with heavy guards. We also enhance the benchmark suite, adding new features and enhancing its extensibility and user-friendliness. We extend the join pattern implementation with a less ambiguous syntax as well as dynamic pattern switching. Finally, we present a new complex model use case for join patterns, showing their applicability in a microservice web architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案依赖闭源模型，存在推理成本高、透明度低和缺乏适应性等问题，需桥接自然语言和OverpassQL。

Method: 提出开源标签感知语言模型OsmT，引入Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA)机制，定义OverpassQL-to-Text反向任务。

Result: 在公共基准上评估，在查询生成和解释方面有持续改进，参数少但精度有竞争力。

Conclusion: 开源预训练语言模型在富含模式的地理空间环境中桥接自然语言和结构化查询语言有效。

Abstract: Bridging natural language and structured query languages is a long-standing challenge in the database community. While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in bridging natural language and structured query languages within schema-rich geospatial environments.

Motivation: 研究不同分类器对利比亚方言推文的分类效果，为阿拉伯方言NLP应用提供参考。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、线性支持向量机、多项朴素贝叶斯和伯努利朴素贝叶斯分类器，用QADI语料库，进行预处理和卡方分析筛选特征，开展两项实验评估元特征和分类器性能。

Result: 多项朴素贝叶斯在(1,2)词n - 元语法和(1,5)字符n - 元语法表示下准确率达85.89%，F1分数0.85741，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 精心选择的n - 元语法表示和分类模型对提高利比亚方言识别准确率至关重要，为未来阿拉伯方言NLP研究提供实证基准和见解。

Abstract: This study investigates logistic regression, linear support vector machine, multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for classifying Libyan dialect utterances gathered from Twitter. The dataset used is the QADI corpus, which consists of 540,000 sentences across 18 Arabic dialects. Preprocessing challenges include handling inconsistent orthographic variations and non-standard spellings typical of the Libyan dialect. The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task. The results indicate that carefully selected n-gram representations and classification models play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of Libyan dialect identification. This study provides empirical benchmarks and insights for future research in Arabic dialect NLP applications.

Motivation: 讽刺在网上讨论常见但机器难识别，旨在不依赖神经网络和父评论上下文进行讽刺检测。

Method: 使用Self - Annotated Reddit Corpus的100,000条评论子样本，结合词级和字符级TF - IDF特征与简单风格指标，评估逻辑回归、线性SVM、多项朴素贝叶斯和随机森林四个模型。

Result: 朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归表现最强，讽刺评论F1分数约为0.57。

Conclusion: 虽缺乏对话上下文限制了性能，但结果为使用轻量级和可解释方法的讽刺检测提供了清晰且可重复的基线。

Abstract: Sarcasm is common in online discussions, yet difficult for machines to identify because the intended meaning often contradicts the literal wording. In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators. Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest. Naive Bayes and logistic regression perform the strongest, achieving F1-scores around 0.57 for sarcastic comments. Although the lack of conversational context limits performance, the results offer a clear and reproducible baseline for sarcasm detection using lightweight and interpretable methods.

Result: 现有先进代理在DAComp上表现差，数据工程任务成功率低于20%，数据分析任务得分低于40%。

Conclusion: DAComp能诊断现有代理局限，为企业环境下开发真正有能力的自主数据代理提供测试平台。

Abstract: Real-world enterprise data intelligence workflows encompass data engineering that turns raw sources into analytical-ready tables and data analysis that convert those tables into decision-oriented insights. We introduce DAComp, a benchmark of 210 tasks that mirrors these complex workflows. Data engineering (DE) tasks require repository-level engineering on industrial schemas, including designing and building multi-stage SQL pipelines from scratch and evolving existing systems under evolving requirements. Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities. By clearly diagnosing these limitations, DAComp provides a rigorous and realistic testbed to drive the development of truly capable autonomous data agents for enterprise settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs在NLP中解释性不足，传统方法不适用于NLP中离散的单词数据。

Method: 引入Model - agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE)框架，利用Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP)在嵌入层估计输入显著性。

Result: MASE在Delta Accuracy方面优于其他模型无关的解释方法。

Conclusion: MASE是解释NLP中文本模型操作的有前途的工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interpretability remains elusive, particularly when evaluating their intricate decision-making processes. Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP.

Abstract: The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力二次复杂度限制大语言模型处理长上下文能力，现有上下文压缩方法存在不足。

Method: AdmTree基于信息密度动态分割输入，用要点令牌总结可变长度段作为语义二叉树叶子，结合轻量级聚合机制和冻结的骨干大语言模型。

Result: AdmTree能保留细粒度细节和全局语义连贯，减轻位置偏差，动态适应内容。

Conclusion: AdmTree可有效保留长上下文的语义信息，缓解计算瓶颈。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention constrains Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing long contexts, a capability essential for many advanced applications. Context compression aims to alleviate this computational bottleneck while retaining critical semantic information. However, existing approaches often fall short: explicit methods may compromise local detail, whereas implicit methods can suffer from positional biases, information degradation, or an inability to capture long-range semantic dependencies. We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型推理计算成本高，传统投机解码在推理任务存在问题，现有方法效率低，需改进性能成本比。

Method: 提出Arbitrage框架，使用轻量级路由器根据草稿和目标模型相对优势动态路由生成，而非固定接受阈值。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，Arbitrage始终超越先前的步级投机解码基线，在相同准确率下将推理延迟降低近2倍。

Conclusion: Arbitrage能实现接近最优的效率 - 准确率权衡。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\sim2\times$ at matched accuracy.

Conclusion: FormatRL方法能有效提升结构化文本翻译的结构和翻译质量。

Abstract: Recent works on structured text translation remain limited to the sentence level, as they struggle to effectively handle the complex document-level XML or HTML structures. To address this, we propose \textbf{Format Reinforcement Learning (FormatRL)}, which employs Group Relative Policy Optimization on top of a supervised fine-tuning model to directly optimize novel structure-aware rewards: 1) TreeSim, which measures structural similarity between predicted and reference XML trees and 2) Node-chrF, which measures translation quality at the level of XML nodes. Additionally, we apply StrucAUC, a fine-grained metric distinguishing between minor errors and major structural failures. Experiments on the SAP software-documentation benchmark demonstrate improvements across six metrics and an analysis further shows how different reward functions contribute to improvements in both structural and translation quality.

Conclusion: 语义软引导（SSB）技术能有效解决RLVR的瓶颈问题，提升模型推理准确率。

Abstract: Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping, and the model, curated dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/semantic-soft-bootstrapping.

TL;DR: 提出SignRoundV2后训练量化框架，提升大语言模型极低比特量化性能，实验显示在低比特下有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低比特量化大语言模型常导致严重性能下降，需要有效方法解决。

Method: 引入结合梯度信息和量化偏差的快速敏感度指标指导层位比特分配，进行轻量级预调搜索量化尺度。

Result: 方法在大语言模型上保持有竞争力的准确率，4 - 5比特时方差约1%，2比特也有好结果。

Conclusion: SignRoundV2能缩小与全精度模型差距，实现生产级性能。

Abstract: Extreme low-bit quantization is critical for efficiently deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it often leads to severe performance degradation at 2-bits and even 4-bits (e.g., MXFP4). We present SignRoundV2, a post-training quantization framework that is highly effective even without mixed-precision. SignRoundV2 introduces (1) a fast sensitivity metric that combines gradient information with quantization-induced deviations to guide layer-wise bit allocation, and (2) a lightweight pre-tuning search for quantization scales to improve extremely low-bit quantization. These components allow SignRoundV2 to close the gap with full-precision models. Extensive experiments indicate that our method sustains competitive accuracy for LLMs, achieving production-grade performance with about 1 percent variance at 4-5 bits and strong results even at 2 bits. The implementation is available at https://github.com/intel/auto-round.

TL;DR: 本文提出 Source - Shielded Updates (SSU) 策略，在低资源约束下用无标签目标语言数据适配指令大语言模型，减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展指令大语言模型语言多样性时，依赖昂贵目标语言标签数据和适应时的灾难性遗忘问题阻碍发展，需在低资源约束下解决。

Method: 引入 SSU 策略，利用少量源数据和参数重要性评分方法确定维护源能力的关键参数，在适配前采用列冻结策略保护这些参数。

Result: 在五种语言和 7B、13B 模型实验中，SSU 减轻灾难性遗忘，源任务性能下降平均仅 3.4%（7B）和 2.8%（13B），远低于全量微调；目标语言性能与全量微调相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: SSU 策略能有效减轻灾难性遗忘，在低资源下适配指令大语言模型效果良好。

Abstract: Expanding the linguistic diversity of instruct large language models (LLMs) is crucial for global accessibility but is often hindered by the reliance on costly specialized target language labeled data and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning. SSU also achieves target-language performance highly competitive with full fine-tuning, outperforming it on all benchmarks for 7B models and the majority for 13B models.

TL;DR: 提出SEAL两阶段语义解析框架解决KBCQA问题，实验表明其在多任务上达SOTA，提升结构准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBCQA方法在处理复杂查询时存在结构不准确和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 引入SEAL框架，第一阶段用LLM提取核心S表达式，再由代理校准模块优化；第二阶段基于模板完成构建可执行S表达式，且有自进化机制。

Result: 在SPICE基准测试中取得SOTA表现，尤其在多跳推理、比较和聚合任务上，提升了结构准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: SEAL框架具备强大且可扩展的对话推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA) confronts persistent challenges in resolving coreference, modeling contextual dependencies, and executing complex logical reasoning. Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否从原始文本中捕捉句法结构、语音线索和韵律模式等深层语言属性，并应用于自然语言相关任务。

Method: 引入基于古腾堡计划的多语言体裁分类数据集，为每个样本添加三种明确的语言特征集以评估对分类性能的影响。

Result: 大语言模型分类器能从原始文本或明确提供的特征中学习潜在语言结构，但不同特征对不同任务的贡献不均衡。

Conclusion: 在模型训练中融入更复杂的语言信号很重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across diverse language related tasks, yet whether they capture deeper linguistic properties, such as syntactic structure, phonetic cues, and metrical patterns from raw text remains unclear. To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training.

Motivation: 此前研究多关注文本虚假信息，对视觉内容在传播中的作用研究较少，需分析虚假和AI生成图像传播情况。

Method: 整合文本情感、视觉属性和传播指标，构建框架来分析虚假和AI生成图像在不同Reddit社区的传播。

Abstract: AI-generated content and misinformation are increasingly prevalent on social networks. While prior research primarily examined textual misinformation, fewer studies have focused on visual content's role in virality. In this work, we present the first large-scale analysis of how misinformation and AI-generated images propagate through repost cascades across five ideologically diverse Reddit communities. By integrating textual sentiment, visual attributes, and diffusion metrics (e.g., time-to-first repost, community reach), our framework accurately predicts both immediate post-level virality (AUC=0.83) and long-term cascade-level spread (AUC=0.998). These findings offer essential insights for moderating synthetic and misleading visual content online.

TL;DR: 提出ReVeal - MT模型解决多发射机共存时无线电环境映射性能下降问题，验证其在多发射机场景准确性及低计算复杂度，有频谱管理潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在多发射机共存时因阴影和相邻发射机干扰导致性能下降，需改进无线电环境映射模型。

Method: 扩展单发射机的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）工作，推导多发射机接收信号强度指示（RSSI）的偏微分方程（PDE）公式，提出ReVeal - MT模型并将多源PDE残差集成到神经网络损失函数。

Result: 使用真实测量数据验证，ReVeal - MT在多发射机场景精度大幅提升，如在370平方公里区域用45个样本RMSE仅2.66 dB，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: ReVeal - MT显著提升了现实多发射机条件下无线电环境映射能力，有实现精细频谱管理和主、次用户精确共存的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling Secondary Users~(SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting Primary Users~(PUs). While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs.

Abstract: The evolution toward sixth-generation wireless systems positions intelligence as a native network capability, fundamentally transforming the design of radio access networks (RANs). Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice. Finally, we identify open challenges in semantic representation standardization, scalable trustworthy agent coordination, O-RAN interoperability, and energy-efficient AI deployment, and outline research directions toward operational semantic-agentic AI-RAN.

Method: 提出基于DDPM的框架UnwrapDiff，将传统最小成本流算法（SNAPHU）输出作为条件引导；构建含大气效应和多样噪声模式的合成数据集评估鲁棒性。

Result: 模型利用条件先验，减少多样噪声模式影响，NRMSE比SNAPHU平均降低10.11%，在诸如堤坝侵入等困难情况有更好重建质量。

Conclusion: 基于DDPM的UnwrapDiff框架在InSAR相位解缠中表现优于传统SNAPHU算法。

Abstract: Phase unwrapping is a fundamental problem in InSAR data processing, supporting geophysical applications such as deformation monitoring and hazard assessment. Its reliability is limited by noise and decorrelation in radar acquisitions, which makes accurate reconstruction of the deformation signal challenging. We propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based framework for InSAR phase unwrapping, UnwrapDiff, in which the output of the traditional minimum cost flow algorithm (SNAPHU) is incorporated as conditional guidance. To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions.

Abstract: This paper studies a Kyle-Back model with a risk-averse insider possessing exponential utility and a dynamic stochastic signal about the asset's terminal fundamental value. While the existing literature considers either risk-neutral insiders with dynamic signals or risk-averse insiders with static signals, we establish equilibrium when both features are present. Our approach imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning methodology to construct a Schrödinger bridge between the insider's signal and the asset price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution and removes risk aversion constraints.
  We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equilibrium. We obtain explicit closed-form solutions for important cases including deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, demonstrating the tractability of our framework.

Abstract: This work shows how human physical reasoning can guide machine-driven symbolic regression toward discovering empirical laws from observations. As an example, we derive a simple equation that classifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) into two distinct Gaussian distributions, indicating the existence of two physical classes. This human-AI workflow integrates feature selection, dimensional analysis, and symbolic regression: deep learning first analyzes CHIME Catalog 1 and identifies six independent parameters that collectively provide a complete description of FRBs; guided by Buckingham-$π$ analysis and correlation analysis, humans then construct dimensionless groups; finally, symbolic regression performed by the machine discovers the governing equation. When applied to the newer CHIME Catalog, the equation produces consistent results, demonstrating that it captures the underlying physics. This framework is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains.

Conclusion: 发送者能通过控制信息披露时机和利用信息及时性实现高效用。

Abstract: This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.

Conclusion: CRAFT - E通过符号推理与具身感知结合，为基于功能的对象选择提供了可解释和可定制的替代方案，支持辅助机器人系统的可信决策。

Abstract: Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.

Abstract: To collaborate with humans, robots must infer goals that are often ambiguous, difficult to articulate, or not drawn from a fixed set. Prior approaches restrict inference to a predefined goal set, rely only on observed actions, or depend exclusively on explicit instructions, making them brittle in real-world interactions. We present BALI (Bidirectional Action-Language Inference) for goal prediction, a method that integrates natural language preferences with observed human actions in a receding-horizon planning tree. BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals. We evaluate the approach in collaborative cooking tasks, where goals may be novel to the robot and unbounded. Compared to baselines, BALI yields more stable goal predictions and significantly fewer mistakes.

Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.

Conclusion: 所提方法在无人机数据驱动任务决策方面表现良好，能有效改善任务时间。

Abstract: Drones are becoming indispensable in many application domains. In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest.

Abstract: In this work, we present FLEX, an FPGA-CPU accelerator for mixed-cell-height legalization tasks. We address challenges from the following perspectives. First, we optimize the task assignment strategy and perform an efficient task partition between FPGA and CPU to exploit their complementary strengths. Second, a multi-granularity pipelining technique is employed to accelerate the most time-consuming step, finding optimal placement position (FOP), in legalization. At last, we particularly target the computationally intensive cell shifting process in FOP, optimizing the design to align it seamlessly with the multi-granularity pipelining framework for further speedup. Experimental results show that FLEX achieves up to 18.3x and 5.4x speedups compared to state-of-the-art CPU-GPU and multi-threaded CPU legalizers with better scalability, while improving legalization quality by 4% and 1%.

By leveraging ASP's declarative nature, this work expresses complex geometric and electrical constraints in a natural and concise manner. The two-phase solving methodology first ensures feasibility before optimizing layout quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach generates compact, manufacturable layouts for a range of circuit complexities. This work represents a significant advancement in automated stripboard layout, offering a practical tool for electronics prototyping and education while showcasing the power of declarative programming for solving complex design automation problems.

Abstract: Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions.
