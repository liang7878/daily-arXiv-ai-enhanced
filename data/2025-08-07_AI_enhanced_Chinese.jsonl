This paper is the first to introduce a sublinear-time\nalgorithm for counting squares in the packed setting. The packed representation\nof a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ is given as a\nsequence of $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine\nword consists of $\\omega \\ge \\log_2 n$ bits).

We use the techniques for\nextracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al.

The\nlong-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer\nruns) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$. The number of all\nother long-period runs is $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit\nrepresentation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ time by\nleveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer\nruns by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of\nlayer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots\nof runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate\nequal squares.

We also explore how these guidelines\ncan be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications,\nchallenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners.\nTo support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that\ncategorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of\nimplementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and\nflexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping\nteams move from principles to sustainable action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd17\u6761\u57f9\u517b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a9\u56e2\u961f\u5c06\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u878d\u5165\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u57f9\u517b\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5236\u5b9a\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "method": "\u5236\u5b9a17\u6761\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5206\u4eab\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u6311\u6218\u548c\u514b\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u7eb3\u610f\u613f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5c06\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u878d\u5165\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u56e2\u961f\u5c06\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u884c\u52a8\u3002"}}

The results\ndemonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to\nadopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this\nrelationship.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks.

Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities.

This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats.

While introducing topography typically\nleads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture\nexhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1\naccuracy, compared to a 3\\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the\nbest-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in\nbrain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates\nefficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in\nTDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs\noffer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like\nfeatures, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science\nphenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep\nlearning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eTDSNNs\u7684STC\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u590d\u5236\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251ANN\uff0c\u8868\u660eTDSNN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7c7b\u8111\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6ANN\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u751f\u7269\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528SNNs\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSTC\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e8eTDSNNs\u3002", "result": "STC\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTDSNN\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\uff0c\u7c7b\u8111\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251ANN\uff0c\u4e14\u62d3\u6251\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TDSNN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7c7b\u8111\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing\nmultimodal models predominantly rely on \"one-time\" diagnostic approaches,\nlacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to\nchallenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse\nrewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports.

We further propose a unified\nframework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop\nsymbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.\nOur empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,\nhighlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,\nand reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdSymbolBench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SymbolBench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

This protocol is\nstraightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a\nparticular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that\nonline systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models\nreflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But\nif this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will\na model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose\na methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are\nretrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on\nthe one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,\n(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation\nprotocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is\nagnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of\nthis framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of\nalgorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and\nplasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible\ntrade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will\nbe necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the\nusefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics\nof recommendation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u671f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5GoodReads\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u53ea\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u8fc7\u53bb\u67d0\u65f6\u523b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6309\u4fdd\u7559\u8fc7\u53bb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6307\u6807\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728GoodReads\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u4e8c\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e86\u89e3\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u5f88\u6709\u7528\u3002"}}

Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that\nsupports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.\nTwo cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a\ncognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive\nskills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's\nself-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy\noutperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and\nreal-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784Cognition Forest\u548c\u6846\u67b6Galaxy\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aGalaxy\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4e2a\u4eba\u52a9\u7406\uff08IPAs\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u4e14\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684IPAs\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCognition Forest\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faGalaxy\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406KoRa\u548cKernel\u3002", "result": "Galaxy\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCognition Forest\u7684Galaxy\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u4e14\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684IPAs\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically leverage either global\nlow-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers\nfrom notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and\nmay disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often\nrequire extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition.

The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on\na combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a\nrelatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors,\nsimplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models\noften does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider\nthe broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly\nreduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or\nimage-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM\ndevelopment for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with\nscarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing\nequations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this\npaper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems\nthat are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely:\nminimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a\nthreat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of\nthe order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing\nequations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training\nloss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system\ntrajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder\n(VAE).

Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

While\nvarious approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:\nrule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity\nrequirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically\nequivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the\nentire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited\nto small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary\naugmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and\nLLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six\nindustrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in\nproject-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%\nimprovements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,\nalong with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools.

This study proposes\na self-supervised domain adaptation framework for robust concrete damage\nclassification using coda wave signals. To support this framework, an advanced\nvirtual testing platform is developed, combining multiscale modeling of\nconcrete degradation with ultrasonic wave propagation simulations. This setup\nenables the generation of large-scale labeled synthetic data under controlled\nconditions, reducing the dependency on costly and time-consuming experimental\nlabeling. However, neural networks trained solely on synthetic data often\nsuffer from degraded performance when applied to experimental data due to\ndomain shifts. To bridge this domain gap, the proposed framework integrates\ndomain adversarial training, minimum class confusion loss, and the Bootstrap\nYour Own Latent (BYOL) strategy. These components work jointly to facilitate\neffective knowledge transfer from the labeled simulation domain to the\nunlabeled experimental domain, achieving accurate and reliable damage\nclassification in concrete.

We consider\nlearning the density ratio given i.i.d. observations from each of the two\ndistributions. We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with\nefficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called\nthe balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio\ncan be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning.\nSpecifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that\nparallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that\nparallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present\ntwo boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other\nbased on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the\ndensity ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's\nresemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a\npseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective\ngeneralized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers\ndesigned for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred\ndensity ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and\ncomplex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be\nsubstantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close\nconnection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the\nvariational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger\ndistance.

Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from\nscalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our\nevaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of\nthe U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faU - PINet\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faU - PINet\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u78c1\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7535\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u67423D\u7269\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u81ea\u8026\u5408\u548c\u4e92\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "U - PINet\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "U - PINet\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This\nstudy sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based\nstatic code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three\nstate-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform\n(GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten\nreal-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories\nsuch as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure\nclassical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,\nand the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based\nscanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their\nstatic counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'\nadvantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason\nacross broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial\ntrade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language\nmodels mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation\nartefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static\nanalysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and\nimprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We\ntherefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in\ndevelopment for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic\nrule-based scanners for high-assurance verification.

Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent\ninteractions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.\nMany recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older\ninteractions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the\nmore informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the\nflow of time explicitly.\n  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style\nrecommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can\nlearn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In\naddition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully\ncontinuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside\nthe loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and\nthey are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution.\n  We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span\nmultiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant\nfor a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,\nour models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying\nitem popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also\nindicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to\nachieve the best performance on the unseen test set.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our\nmethod is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the\nnumber of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially\nstructured.

Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard\nextractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on\nmodality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over\ncross-modal alignment.

This approach yields semantically aligned representations\nwithout requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable\nperformance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive\nadvantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling\ndirect assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are\nincorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve\nrecommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and\nalignment encoded within LVLMs outputs.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy.

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate.

Such representations also\nhave the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems\ncapable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this\ngoal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective\nstrategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses\nthese challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically\ndesigned to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language\nmodels (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this\nend, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark\ncomprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240\nsentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this\nbenchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot\nlearning and fine-tuning approaches.

This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework.

To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a\nCurriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.\nThe agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of\nadversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) on successful ones.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training.

Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained\nwith a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be\ndecomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding\nthe latter alleviates numerical issues.

The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual\nangle estimates ranged from 3.9{\\deg} to 9.4{\\deg} for the models evaluated.\nFurthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable\nclinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of\nnormal velocity values as a stenosis.

Transformer-based models and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on\nrigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static\nfusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These\nlimitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific\nrelationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a\nnovel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,\nwhere the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures\nalong with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and\nspectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism\nwhich adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically\nweighting the importance of each head based on the features.

To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split\ninference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy\nloss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based\nin-distribution and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPrivDFS\u8303\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u79c1\u6709\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u670d\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79c1\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u6709\u6743\u8861\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrivDFS\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u533a\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u8fd8\u6709PrivDFS - AT\u548cPrivDFS - KD\u4e24\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u548cCelebA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cPrivDFS\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u62c6\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11100\u500d\u4e14\u65e0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivDFS\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems\nfrom the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog\nrepresentations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring\nrobustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic\nfeature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete\nlatent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a\nnon-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across\ndifferent systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the\ninfluence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent\nliterature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on\nreliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the\nneed of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound\nshear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional\nneural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal\nultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input\nimages, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw\nradiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach\nto a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with\ndifferent elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant\ndifferences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,\nregardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly\nimproves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach\ncan reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed\nradiofrequency data.

A central\nproblem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing\nthe creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.\n  The research proposes a \"reference model\" for the development and\nimplementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is\nbased on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical\ndecision-making. The model introduces the concept of \"computational law\" or\n\"algorithmic law\". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI\nsystems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable,\nalgorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper\nemphasises the need for a \"dedicated operational context\" for autonomous AI\nsystems, analogous to the \"operational design domain\" for autonomous vehicles.\nThis means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules\nwithin which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for\ntraining AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure\nfairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start.

Existing PFL\nmethods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data\nheterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders\nconvergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.

This study explores whether deep learning\ncan enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting\nanalysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from\nhealthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare\nthree recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional\nmachine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the\nrecurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw\ntemporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow\nthat recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they\nexhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods\nsignificantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with\nbalanced metrics.

Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,\nand MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u8303\u5f0f\uff08CIP\uff09\u53caFed - CI\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6162\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4e0d\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCIP\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1Fed - CI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u8282\u70b9\u4ec5\u7528\u672c\u5730\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFed - CI\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRMSE\u3001MAE\u3001MAPE\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53478%\u300114%\u300116%\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed - CI\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7b26\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories.

Inducing minimal\nextra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of\njailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of\nLRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving\nstate-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common\nexaggerated safety issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236ReasoningGuard\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6ce8\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u7f29\u653e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e09\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e03\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "conclusion": "ReasoningGuard\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,\nincluding continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This\nsurvey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for\nresearchers developing lifelong vision-language systems.

Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired\nnew research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be\ndirectly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its\ntext-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the\nmask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its\nutility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core\ncomponents: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a\ncontext sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints.

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses.

In this work, we show that an\neffective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to\nfocus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,\nwe propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding\nthat is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal\nvariables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is\ncapable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any\nadditional supervision.

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images.
