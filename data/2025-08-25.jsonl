Current GPU power governors (for example,\nNVIDIA's default) overlook this asymmetry and treat both stages uniformly. The\nresult is mismatched voltage and frequency settings, head-of-line blocking, and\nexcessive energy use.\n  We introduce GreenLLM, an SLO-aware serving framework that minimizes GPU\nenergy by explicitly separating prefill and decode control. At ingress,\nrequests are routed into length-based queues so short prompts avoid\nhead-of-line blocking and TTFT improves.

In this work, we propose\nMetamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code\nexecuted by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is\nthat, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed\nwhen executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more\ndifferential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to\nexpose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this\ngeneral intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five\nwidely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,\ncompilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the\nbug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC\nhas a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is\n4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'\neffectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage\nwhile still capturing the part of the program that is being tested.

Specifically, we test whether persona-based\nmodels can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,\npromoting misinformation or biased narratives.\n  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate\nrealistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their\nbeliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.\nPersuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief\ndistributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are\nfurther probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with\nadditional models.\n  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt\ntone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,\nand legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate\nmisinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing\nstereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than\nin occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias\nreinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use\nand support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment."}

To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.\nHowever, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.\nFirst, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple\nWatch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by\nreal-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management\nand gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate\nwhether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks\ninvolved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively\nimpact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the\nwrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload\nsetting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.\nTo generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data\ngeneration pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements\n(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user\nqueries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and\nbrand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated\nevaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web\nagents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current\nagents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

Because of the lack of transparency, it\nis challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.\nHere, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm\nprediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict\nwhether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within\n24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our\napproach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM\nnetwork to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the\nmodel's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc\nmodel-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the\npredicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's\nbehavior across multiple sequences within an AR.

Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric.

We benchmark the\nsimulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can\nassess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly\nidentify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish\nthat simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra\nin training ML models."}

Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge\nconcepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts\nbelieved to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,\nerror-prone, or overly general.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary\nrepresentations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence\nof a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These\nrepresentations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations\nand are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep\nlearning KT architectures.\n  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student\nmodeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show\nthat augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved\npredictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs\nenhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based\nmethod (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes\nwithin a simulated student environment."}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare\nconcepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose\nMV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images\nfrom a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion\nmodel on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.\nTraining such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid\nstrategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.\nThis involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views\nthat simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside\ntraining on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out\nview prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other\nviews to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD\nevaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.\nExperiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and\npersonalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D\nconsistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while\nmaintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks."}
