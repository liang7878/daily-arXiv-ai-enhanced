The huge size becomes a limiting factor for broader adoption, and\nits fast growth rate will soon exhaust all the available storage devices. To\naddress these issues, we present EBCC (Error Bounded Climate-data Compressor).\nIt follows a two-layer approach: a base compression layer using JPEG2000 to\ncapture the bulk of the data with a high compression ratio, and a residual\ncompression layer using wavelet transform and SPIHT encoding to efficiently\neliminate long-tail extreme errors introduced by the base compression layer. It\nincorporates a feedback rate-control mechanism for both layers that adjusts\ncompression ratios to achieve the specified maximum error target. We evaluate\nEBCC alongside other established compression methods on benchmarks related to\nweather and climate science including error statistics, a case study on\nprimitive and derived variables near a hurricane, evaluation of the closure of\nthe global energy budget, and a Lagrangian air parcel trajectory simulation.\nThis is the first time that trajectory simulation is used to benchmark\ncompression methods. Our method concentrates most errors near zero, while\nothers tend to distribute errors uniformly within the error bound. EBCC\noutperforms other methods in the benchmarks at relative error targets ranging\nfrom 0.1% to 10% and achieves compression ratios from 15x to more than 300x. In\nthe energy budget closure and Lagrangian trajectory benchmarks, it can achieve\nmore than 100x compression while keeping errors within natural variability\nderived from ERA5 uncertainty members.

Among various ANNS algorithms, graph-based\nmethods are state-of-the-art. However, ANNS often suffers from a significant\ndrop in accuracy for certain queries, especially in Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nscenarios. To address this issue, a recent approach named RoarGraph constructs\na bipartite graph between the base data and historical queries to bridge the\ngap between two different distributions. However, it suffers from some\nlimitations: (1) Building a bipartite graph between two distributions lacks\ntheoretical support, resulting in the query distribution not being effectively\nutilized by the graph index. (2) Requires a sufficient number of historical\nqueries before graph construction and suffers from high construction times. (3)\nWhen the query workload changes, it requires reconstruction to maintain high\nsearch accuracy.\n  In this paper, we first propose Escape Hardness, a metric to evaluate the\nquality of the graph structure around the query. Then we divide the graph\nsearch into two stages and dynamically identify and fix defective graph regions\nin each stage based on Escape Hardness. (1) From the entry point to the\nvicinity of the query. We propose Reachability Fixing (RFix), which enhances\nthe navigability of some key nodes. (2) Searching within the vicinity of the\nquery. We propose Neighboring Graph Defects Fixing (NGFix) to improve graph\nconnectivity in regions where queries are densely distributed. The results of\nextensive experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmethods on real-world datasets, achieving up to 2.25x faster search speed for\nOOD queries at 99% recall compared with RoarGraph and 6.88x faster speed\ncompared with HNSW.

We study a corresponding version of this packing\nproblem in the covering setting, stylized as the discretized point patrolling\nproblem in the literature. Specifically, given $n$ tasks with periods $a_i$,\nthe problem asks whether it is possible to assign each day to a task such that\nevery task $i$ is scheduled at \\textit{most} once every $a_i$ days.

This\npaper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically\nacross horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the\noptimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common\npractice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally\nfrom all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and\nempirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the\nasset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying\nBayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate\ndynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band\ncontributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and\nlong-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe\nratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then\nrationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that\nthe medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The\nresulting \"barbell\" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures\nmost of the performance while reducing model complexity.

It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes\nback from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI\nadvances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the\nintermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal\nconnections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated\ncausal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for\nhow long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically\nrigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The\nforward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR\ntraces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal\npredictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,\nrespectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,\neliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient\napproximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the\nuse of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR\nframework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It\nadvances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in\nEarth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables\nwhen determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking\nmechanisms in the equatorial region.

Our method improves\nupon the current state of the art non-smooth Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as it\nachieves a relatively sharper approximation of the gradient of log posterior\ndensity and a computational burden of at most the current state-of-the-art. A\nchief contribution of this work is the theoretical analysis of p-HMC. We\nprovide conditions for geometric ergodicity of the underlying HMC chain.

PA leverages system monitoring to monitor system\nactivities as a series of system audit events and organizes these events as a\nprovenance graph to show the dependencies among system activities, which can\nreveal steps of cyber attacks. Despite their potential, existing PA techniques\nface two critical challenges: (1) they are inflexible and non-extensible,\nmaking it difficult to incorporate analyst expertise, and (2) they are memory\ninefficient, often requiring>100GB of RAM to hold entire event streams, which\nfundamentally limits scalability and deployment in real-world environments. To\naddress these limitations, we propose the PROGQL framework, which provides a\ndomain-specific graph search language with a well-engineered query engine,\nallowing PA over system audit events and expert knowledge to be jointly\nexpressed as a graph search query and thereby facilitating the investigation of\ncomplex cyberattacks. In particular, to support dependency searches from a\nstarting edge required in PA, PROGQL introduces new language constructs for\nconstrained graph traversal, edge weight computation, value propagation along\nweighted edges, and graph merging to integrate multiple searches. Moreover, the\nPROGQL query engine is optimized for efficient incremental graph search across\nheterogeneous database backends, eliminating the need for full in-memory\nmaterialization and reducing memory overhead.

However, recent work shows\nGP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on\nSMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us\nto rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We\nfind the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and\noptimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the\nassumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.\nMoreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement\nin DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve\ndistribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional\nassumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and\ndistort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,\nwhich can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random\nforest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,\nCentrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in\nsurrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient\nboosting ensembles.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference\nin wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to\ncomplete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out\nusing neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference\nperformance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be\nsplit between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving\ncollaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference\nutility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and\npropose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian\noptimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our\nsolution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split\npoint. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition\nfunction that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and\nconstraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model\non the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world\nmMobile wireless channel datasets.

However, user behaviors\nwithin advertising domains are inherently sparse, posing a significant barrier\nto constructing long behavioral sequences using data from a single advertising\ndomain alone. This motivates us to collect users' behaviors not only across\ndiverse advertising scenarios, but also beyond the boundaries of the\nadvertising domain into content domains-thereby constructing unified commercial\nbehavior trajectories. This cross-domain or cross-scenario integration gives\nrise to the following challenges: (1) feature taxonomy gaps between distinct\nscenarios and domains, (2) inter-field interference arising from irrelevant\nfeature field pairs, and (3) target-wise interference in temporal and semantic\npatterns when optimizing for different advertising targets. To address these\nchallenges, we propose several practical approaches within the two-stage\nframework for long-sequence modeling. In the first (search) stage, we design a\nhierarchical hard search method for handling complex feature taxonomy\nhierarchies, alongside a decoupled embedding-based soft search to alleviate\nconflicts between attention mechanisms and feature representation. In the\nsecond (sequence modeling) stage, we introduce: (a) Decoupled Side Information\nTemporal Interest Networks (TIN) to mitigate inter-field conflicts; (b)\nTarget-Decoupled Positional Encoding and Target-Decoupled SASRec to address\ntarget-wise interference; and (c) Stacked TIN to model high-order behavioral\ncorrelations.

However, locating architectural knowledge, such\nas architectural solutions remains challenging due to the overwhelming volume\nof unstructured content and fragmented discussions. Developers must manually\nsift through posts to find relevant architectural insights, which is\ntime-consuming and error-prone. This study introduces ArchISMiner, a framework\nfor mining architectural knowledge from SO. The framework comprises two\ncomplementary components: ArchPI and ArchISPE. ArchPI trains and evaluates\nmultiple models, including conventional ML/DL models, Pre-trained Language\nModels (PLMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs), and selects the\nbest-performing model to automatically identify Architecture-Related Posts\n(ARPs) among programming-related discussions. ArchISPE employs an indirect\nsupervised approach that leverages diverse features, including BERT embeddings\nand local TextCNN features, to extract architectural issue-solution pairs. Our\nevaluation shows that the best model in ArchPI achieves an F1-score of 0.960 in\nARP detection, and ArchISPE outperforms baselines in both SE and NLP fields,\nachieving F1-scores of 0.883 for architectural issues and 0.894 for solutions.\nA user study further validated the quality (e.g., relevance and usefulness) of\nthe identified ARPs and the extracted issue-solution pairs. Moreover, we\napplied ArchISMiner to three additional forums, releasing a dataset of over 18K\narchitectural issue-solution pairs.

This study\ndevelops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,\nenabling timely preventative interventions.\n  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we\nidentified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\\% male) who experienced\naspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration\ncohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were\ntrained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative\naspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects\n(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.\n  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\\% sensitivity on a\nheld-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age\nemerged as the most important predictors.

In response to\nthis challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability\nto leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately\nfacilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.\nHowever, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge\ntransfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods\nin assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori\ntransferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their\nimprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often\nnecessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them\ninefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces\na Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve\nmulti-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.\nSpecifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian\nperspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,\nenabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,\nultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively\nsuppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various\nSAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically\nvalidated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority\nover peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based\non cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological\nvariability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from\ndifferent cell types can be projected close together, making accurate\nclustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework\nthat separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is\noperationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion\nprior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while\nto steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional\nobservation space. This unique \"input-space steering\" ensures the denoising\ntrajectory remains faithful to the original data structure.

To\novercome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of\nParametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and\ninterpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)\ndecoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then\nsynthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in\nthe aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety\nmetric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP\non two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that\nLAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100\nsamples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond\ntraining ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed\nparameters.

However, the deployment of leading\ncommercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered\nby high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper\ninvestigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a\nresource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a\none-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent\nrecognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation\n(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user\nqueries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,\ncreating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results\ndemonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the\nperformance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance\nanalysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ\nreduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older\nGPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF\nformats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a\nreduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline.

To address\nthis gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level\nadaptive loss function.We begin by defining the \"Modality Gap\" as the\ndifference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and\nvisual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap\ndistribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM).

This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient\nglobal model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the\ncompact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates\nthree key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge\ndistillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature\nalignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs\nnormalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness\nand mitigate client drift.

Specifically, we summarize 5\ncrucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,\nLogical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge\nLearning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in\nrecent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the\ncore human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving\nprocess. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement\ntheir performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison.

However, most existing equivariant\nmodels are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the\nbroader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many\nscientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural\nnetwork architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.\nReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,\nincluding general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant\nbilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features\nand matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This\narchitecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only\napply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility\nacross a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic\nbenchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a\nLorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with\ngeometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,\nyielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy.

Unlike classical dimension-reduction\nmethods, where information discarded during compression is often difficult to\nrecover, CPFM preserves the knowledge of residual information within the\nweights of a flow network. This design provides bespoke controllability: users\nmay decide which semantic factors to retain explicitly in the latent space,\nwhile the complementary information remains recoverable through the flow\nnetwork. Coupled flow matching builds on two components: (i) an extended\nGromov-Wasserstein optimal transport objective that establishes a probabilistic\ncorrespondence between data and embeddings, and (ii) a dual-conditional\nflow-matching network that extrapolates the correspondence to the underlying\nspace.

First,\nintra-item consistency: the n digits jointly specify one item, yet the\nleft-to-right causality trains each digit only under its prefix and blocks\nbidirectional cross-digit evidence, collapsing supervision to a single causal\npath. Second, inter-digit heterogeneity: digits differ in semantic granularity\nand predictability, while the uniform next-token objective assigns equal weight\nto all digits, overtraining easy digits and undertraining hard digits.

However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the\nbrain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient\nbrain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks\n(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before\nlearning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative\ninference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster\ntraining. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the\ninference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep\nPCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards\nscaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.\nFirst, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an\napproximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite\nexplicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this\napproximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily\nhigher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective\nlandscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing\ngradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a\nstudy of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation\ncalled ``$\\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+\nlayer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.\nOverall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of\nthe inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for\nfuture research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at\nscale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\uff08PC\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9PCN\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5BP\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u5728\u5927\u8111\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0cPC\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790PC\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u660ePC\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3100+\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9PCN\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u82e5\u8981\u4e0eBP\u7ade\u4e89\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In \\textit{Symbolic Neural\nGenerators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of\nfeasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each\nspecification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a\nneural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic\nspecification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the\ncomplementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG\nis a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible\ninstances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that\nsatisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics\nfor such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and\n\\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,\nand outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In\nthis extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We\nimplement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming\n(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug\ndesign.

The\nextraction stage utilizes powerful parsing libraries like BeautifulSoup and\nregular expressions to extract relevant data from the HTML. Finally, the\nexecution stage structures the data into accessible formats, such as CSV,\nensuring the scraped content is organized for easy use. To provide personalized\nand secure experiences, the application includes user registration and login\nfunctionalities, supported by MongoDB, which stores user data and scraping\nhistory.

To\nmitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned\nmodel's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models\nand overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in\nsuboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy\nfor pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and\nhigh efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected\nin attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this\ninformation can significantly recover model performance.

Comprehensive\nevaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that DynaCausal consistently\nsurpasses state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average AC@1 of 0.63 with\nabsolute gains from 0.25 to 0.46, and delivering both accurate and\ninterpretable diagnoses in highly dynamic microservice environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDynaCausal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynaCausal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDynaCausal\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747AC@1\u4e3a0.63\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca0.25 - 0.46\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaCausal\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

Although generative AI provides an automation\nsolution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone\nto factual \"hallucinations\".

To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task\nsystem that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.\nThe contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.\nFirst, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision\nencoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute\nprediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,\nintroduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own\npredicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to\nimprove factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nthis architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent\nprice regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,\nwith a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation\nprocess proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from\n12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical\nablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the\nautoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to\ndirect vision to language model of similar size.

Prior work suggests\ncalibration can improve alignment, but at-scale evidence is limited. In this\nwork, we investigate the feasibility of applying calibration of code models to\nan in-IDE context. We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical\nmethod for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of\ncode generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for\neffectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a\nscalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain\ncalibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate\nwhether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and\ndeveloper acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24\nmillion real-world developer interactions across multiple programming\nlanguages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on\nPlatt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence\nsignals. We also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to\nindividual users can be effective, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nvolume of user interaction data.

The advent of large\nlanguage models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly\ntransformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently\n(e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories\n(10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates\nsignificant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in\nindustry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately\naddress these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention\n(VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to\nuser history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization\ninto a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those\ntokens.

The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily\nfocus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves\nrelevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and\nthen reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search\nprocess of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of\nthe verification process.

However,\nexisting benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented\nwith weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.\nThis sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with\ntemporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim\nverification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural\nnumerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant\nevidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim\ndecomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human\nfact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given\nthis dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim\ndecomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the\nverification pipeline and draw insights.

As newer releases of these libraries are published,\ndevelopers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While\npinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking\nchanges, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain\nbugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences\nof dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins,\nwhich are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the\nrelease date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over\n60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their\ndependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned\nversions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency\nupgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n  We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers\nto freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer\nprojects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running\nPin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites\ncan provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single\nconsumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular\nlibraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of\nat least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely\nperform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities.

Although deep\nlearning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable\nlimitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed\npredictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale\nprecipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent\nrandomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and\nrarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation\nnowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are\ninherently conflicting.

This observation has led to work on search robustness, where systems\nare penalized if they perform very poorly on some queries. However, this\nprinciple of robustness has been overlooked within a single query. An ambiguous\nor underspecified query (e.g., ``jaguar'') can have several user intents, where\npopular intents often dominate the ranking, leaving users with minority intents\nunsatisfied. Although the diversification literature has long recognized this\nissue, existing metrics only model the average relevance across intents and\nprovide no robustness guarantees. More surprisingly, we show theoretically and\nempirically that many well-known diversification algorithms are no more robust\nthan a naive, non-diversified algorithm. To address this critical gap, we\npropose to frame diversification as a risk-minimization problem. We introduce\nVRisk, which measures the expected risk faced by the least-served fraction of\nintents in a query. Optimizing VRisk produces a robust ranking, reducing the\nlikelihood of poor user experiences. We then propose VRisker, a fast greedy\nre-ranker with provable approximation guarantees. Finally, experiments on NTCIR\nINTENT-2, TREC Web 2012, and MovieLens show the vulnerability of existing\nmethods.

The effectiveness of deep learning\nmethods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences\nmodel performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies\noften construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple\nthree-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real\ngeological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly\navailable three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress\nin deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present\nOpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset\nthat encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.\nOpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple\nconfigurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures\nsuch as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their\ncorresponding variants with anomalous bodies.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times.

While powerful, UNICOS\npresents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding\nwidgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties\nmaintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex\ncodebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges\ncan increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues,\na multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by\na modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code,\na Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector\ndatabase storing both operator documentation and widget animation code.\nPreliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets,\nperforming root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and\ndocumentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these\ncapabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance\nsituational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and\nanomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of\nintroducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into\nthe domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a\nproof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator\ninterfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical\nAI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points\nbut also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator\noperations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aCERN\u7684UNICOS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1AI\u589e\u5f3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u754c\u9762\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "UNICOS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5143\u7d20\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u53ca\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u51cf\u6162\u8bca\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528CTRL\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u5199\u7684UNICOS\u7aef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u865a\u62df\u673a\u4e0a\u57fa\u4e8ePython\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u52a8\u753b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u7801\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u5bf9\u8b66\u62a5\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3aCERN\u63a8\u8fdb\u667a\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u754c\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u51cf\u8f7b\u5f53\u524d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u75db\u70b9\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8f85\u52a9AI\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We\nalso demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data\nscale, is key to defending against novel attacks.\n\\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Warning: This paper contains content that may be\nharmful or offensive in nature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f3c\u66fe\u76f8\u8bc6\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faASCoT\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679032\u7bc7\u653b\u51fb\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u538b\u7f29\u5bf9\u6297\u6280\u80fd\u5230\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdversarial Skill Compositional Training\uff08ASCoT\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6280\u80fd\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "ASCoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u8f6e\u8d8a\u72f1\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5927\u5bf9\u6297\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u662f\u9632\u5fa1\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Project website:\n  https://michalbortkiewicz.github.io/golden-standard/", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when\ntraining data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience\nstitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)\nmethods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never\nintersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common\nbelief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine\nexperience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result\nin a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study\nwhether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings\nwhere function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte\nCarlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do\nachieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with\nconventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between\nsmall and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that\nincreasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both\nthe MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive\nbias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,\nin some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest\nthat stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be\nachieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but\nrather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other\nmachine learning settings (via scale).

This perspective is in\nline with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without\nactivations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$\nquasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications\nof this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove\ngeneralization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low\nrank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the\nSchatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds\nexhibit a sample complexity $ \\widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the\nwidth and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of\nthe weight matrices.

Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and\ngeneralization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for\nannotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of\n0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance\nin textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively.

The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that\nare aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level\nscene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.\nOur architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware\nrepresentations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function\nthat includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed\nregulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable.

In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are\nnonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions\nusing a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models\nbecome computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require\ninverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),\nsemi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for\nmodeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations\nthrough spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this\nidea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with\nChebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into\nhigher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.\nCompared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making\nthem a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in\ndynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel\nlearning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks\n(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with\nuncertainty quantification.

Unlike in classical software\ntesting, every measurement must be carefully budgeted.\n  This paper develops a unified framework for reasoning about how many\nmeasurements are required to verify quantum programs. The goal is to connect\ntheoretical error bounds with concrete test strategies and to extend the\nanalysis from individual tests to full program-level verification.\n  We analyze the relationship between error probability, fidelity, trace\ndistance, and the quantum Chernoff bound to establish fundamental shot count\nlimits. These foundations are applied to three representative testing methods:\nthe inverse test, the swap test, and the chi-square test. Both idealized and\nnoisy devices are considered. We also introduce a program-level budgeting\napproach that allocates verification effort across multiple subroutines.\n  The inverse test is the most measurement efficient, the swap test requires\nabout twice as many shots, and the chi-square test is easiest to implement but\noften needs orders of magnitude more measurements.

In this work, Lanser-CLI\ncontributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle \"file:line:col\" via\na Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a\nprincipled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that\nnormalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata\nwith stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations\n(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,\ntransactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language\nServer facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply\nchecks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize\ndeterminism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for\nthe process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and\ncounterfactual analysis.

We validate our\nhypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant\nquestion-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging\nthe context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to\nconsistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token\ncontexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop\nqueries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

Among\nthese, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to\nidentify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting\nprecise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting\nexample-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images\n(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of\ncapturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach.

In\nparticular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that\ncitizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that\ncitizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,\nwe know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not\nfollow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a\ntrust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider\nthe case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to\ndistribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits\nthe needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according\nto the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of\ncommunity members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust\naffects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if\ntrust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms\ncan lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's\ngoals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to\nincreased fairness and average community trust, though organization success\nsuffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to\ncommunities.

While\ncentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a\ncentral coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer\nfrom scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods.

To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,\nwe propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate\nthe unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language\nreferences. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the\noptimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,\ntherefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of\nmulti-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded\nattacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from\nincomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are\nproposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger\nscenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,\nwe propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by\nclarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more\neffective SemanticAE generators.

PF$\\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six\ndifferent bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,\nN -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state\nvoltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based\nmethods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and\nidentifying open problems for future research.

Second, for wide quantum\nneural networks, we employ the quantum neural tangent kernel framework to\nconstruct an analytic model for QITE. We prove that QITE always converges\nfaster than GD-based VQA, though this advantage is suppressed by the\nexponential growth of Hilbert space dimension.

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for\nreframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines\nover expert knowledge.

Shiji\n  Zhou and Tianbai Yu contributed equally", "summary": "Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful\nmemory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential\ntradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves\nforgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's\noriginal performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use\nmulti-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and\nutility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only\nguarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which\ncauses under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first\nmodel MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the\nunlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility\nloss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to\nunilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the\nadditional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an\nimplicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the\naforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,\nthereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU.

We propose a discretized approach where we find many\ndiscrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible\ncounterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\\textit{Segmented\nSampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find\ndecision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.\nAcross four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can\noutperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in\ndistance between $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can\nalso handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and\ncategorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related\ncharacteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset.

We approach this question by introducing appropriate\nsimplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a\ntestbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is\nSpectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\\Sigma\nV^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we\nidentify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD\noutperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both\nlinear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning\ndominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal\ncomponents of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a\ngrowing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further\nshow that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive\nstep-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,\nwe show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our\ntheoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets.

Our framework clarifies the\nconditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,\nbringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological\npractice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u73af\u8282\u3002"}}

We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment\nloss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling\nrobust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject\ncalibration.

We identify the\ngradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces\nnegative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient\nalgorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for\nrobustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in\nsuperseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,\nwhich inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming\ntraditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones.

Although existing methods\ndemonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their\neffect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,\nwe identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and\nhighlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to\nreasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning\nstrategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the\nrobustness of reasoning.

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning\nnot only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also\nlays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the\nability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and\ndependable systems.

Existing\nmethods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures\nor graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN\nlearning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs\noften suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain\nshifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal\nevolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time\nperiods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's\nrobustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical\nobservations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test\ngraph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it\nin heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance\nof pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training\nor update.

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions.

However,\nthe success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and\nverifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent\nSelf-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,\naim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.\nHowever, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback\n(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general\ndomains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose\nMulti-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in\nsolving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge\nQ&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents\n(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies\nreinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors.

Current research\nremains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most\nstudies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,\nwhile lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems\nin real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct\nchallenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and\nlanding procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized\noperational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position\npaper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive\ndemonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV\noperations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to\norchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key\ntechnical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)\nRoute Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner\nfor waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory\nimplementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility\nthrough three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:\nmulti-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the\ncurrent implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that\ncharts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully\nautonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical\nprerequisites and research challenges at each stage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeLV\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e94\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u8fdc\u7a0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5e73\u53f0\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeLV\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542bLLM - as - Parser\u3001Route Planner\u3001Path Planner\u3001Control Platform\u548cUAV monitoring\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4ee5\u7f16\u6392\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5de1\u903b\u3001\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u4ea4\u4ed8\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e09\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e94\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4ece\u5f53\u524dLLM - as - Parser\u80fd\u529b\u5230\u5168\u81ea\u4e3bLLM - as - Autopilot\u7cfb\u7edf\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6280\u672f\u524d\u63d0\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data\nvisualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.\nAre VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the\ndata visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the\nvision and language modules, or how information is processed within the\nlanguage module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the\ncoordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often\nlead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the\ncorrect coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when\nthe model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be\nsuccessfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,\nsuggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.\nWe further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks\ninvolving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens\nperformance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across\nmany data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling\nperformance.

Different from the basic\nGIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as\nthe co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,\nRIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable\nobjective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational\napproximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed\ngraph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness\nof popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRIDGE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u884cSGNN\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fde\u63a5\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0cSGNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6210\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u9c81\u68d2SGNN\u7814\u7a76\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRIDGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55GIB\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ea7\u751f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6e05\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cRIDGE\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u884cSGNN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RIDGE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SGNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for\nsubgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each\ngraph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment\nmap. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network\n(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of\nall nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by\nan injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in\na lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN\nfrom scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion\nof one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,\nand proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of\nnode-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention\nbetween a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention\nthen controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node\npairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between\nthe nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for\nrefining the alignment.

A\nkey concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether\na particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an\nefficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This\nmethod is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the\naggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise\nprediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and\nnon-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we\nsuppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around\na certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises\nof non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain\ntime step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires\nfewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the\nimage under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation\ndegree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings\nindicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple\ndatasets.

To address this problem, we introduce AVEP\n(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from\nexisting video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic\nand richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which\nconsists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of\nevent, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task.

At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and\ninterpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins\nnumerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide\nrange of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data\nrepresentations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and\npoint clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient\ncharacterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in\ngeometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their\nmathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical\napplications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete\ncurvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a\nsystematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis.

This limitation becomes particularly pronounced\nduring zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns\nand sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical\nInterleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and\nintra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.\nIntra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block\nattention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction\nand dynamic evolution.

Most SSL approaches rely on\nstrong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse\nviews for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations\nrequires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational\ninvariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we\npropose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces\naugmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete\nframes. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete\nspaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced\nby representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the\ncomplementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves\nsuperior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through\nstrong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine\ndatasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific\ncharacteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without\nrelying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance\ngains of up to 15--20\\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

Uniquely, at each time\nstep $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by\napplying the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for\nclassical Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each\npotential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link\nprobability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily\nconnected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant\ndistributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across\nagents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the\nglobal mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean\nrewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed\nalgorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip\nalgorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\\log\nT$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the\noptimal centralized regret $O\\left(\\sum_{k: \\Delta_k>0} \\frac{\\log\nT}{\\Delta_k}\\right)$ and an additional term $O\\left(\\frac{N^2 \\log T}{p\n\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \\frac{KN^2 \\log T}{p}\\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote\nthe total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the\nimpact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link\nprobability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between\ncommunication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal\nregret lower bound.

However, prior diffusion models use a\ndecoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the\nfull network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key\ninsight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)\nrepresenting clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us\nto use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder\narchitecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an\nencoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively\nrefine a noised sequence.

This results in misaligned\nlocal feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model\naggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets\nwithout missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features\nacross clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each\nclient observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing\ninput features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in\nlearned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework\nfeaturing locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side\nembedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.\n  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally\naggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more\neffective use of shared information.

Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks\nwith diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\\% performance improvement under\nsevere data incompleteness.

Recent\nadvances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,\nhave underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer\nfrom high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we\nrevisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing\nthe decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation\npipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding\nmethods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that\nintroduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features\nextracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that\nLanguage Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,\nwhile requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the\ncomputational overhead during both training and inference stages.

Conformal Prediction (CP)\nhas shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces\nmajor challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting\ndomain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.\nMoreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large\nprediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP\nframework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across\ndomains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or\nresamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive\nrejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its\nconfidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability\nof CP under CDP scenarios.

This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,\nperformance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance across multiple domains, including navigation, image\nclassification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need\nfor labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain\nexpertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this\nissue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can\ncreate helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques\nrely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased\ncode complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an\nRL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an\nRL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a\ntraining set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass\nCIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and\nperforms as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight\nlearning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For\nexample, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve\n80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved\n75.53%.

To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses\ntool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as\namplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams.

This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator\nbenchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical\nfidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.\nProject Page: https://tum-pbs.github.io/emulator-superiority", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540cPDEs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7eaf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6bd4\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Many data mining applications perform\noutlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers\nand build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier\ndetection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal\noutlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier\ndetection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of\ndomain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed\nto represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify\noutliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an\nadvantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are\nfounded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been\nevaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from\ntwo different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying\nbalance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a\nneurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate\nthe proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in\nterms of runtime.

Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal\nmethodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models\nis severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory\nrequirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they\nprimarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly\ncompromises analytical faithfulness.

To solve this critical issue, we propose\na novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where the selected UAVs within\na swarm function as a virtual antenna array (VAA), complemented by intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS) to create a robust defense against eavesdropping\nattacks. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that\nsimultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe\nlevel and total energy consumption, requiring joint optimization of UAV\nexcitation current weights, flight trajectories, and IRS phase shifts. This\nproblem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the\nsystem and heterogeneous components. Thus, we first transform the problem into\na heterogeneous Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose a heterogeneous\nmulti-agent control approach (HMCA) that integrates a dedicated IRS control\npolicy with a multi-agent soft actor-critic framework for UAV control, which\nenables coordinated operation across heterogeneous network elements. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed HMCA achieves superior performance compared to\nbaseline approaches in terms of secrecy rate improvement, sidelobe suppression,\nand energy efficiency.

In this research, we\npresent an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation\nleveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained\nReconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The\nmodel was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision\non the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while\nenabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were\napplied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip\nconnections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable\nand 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer.

Although the paradigm is effective for\npre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between\npre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts\npre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable\nprompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph\nprompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,\nthey often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In\nfact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations\nacross demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains\nbiases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we\npropose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness\nfor adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute\nbias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized\nattribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,\nreducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message\nCalibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust\nthe message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of\nthe information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting\nmodules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness.

Moreover, to facilitate\nthe evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that\nexplicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt,\nwe conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense\nmethods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key\ninsights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety.

We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal\ninteractions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and\ninteraction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of\nineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions\nfor a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.\nExisting methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning\nprocess, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,\nespecially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.\nTo cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which\ncontains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and\nlink history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information\nthrough transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA\nprevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being\nforgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly\nand readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness.

Image watermarking for diffusion\nmodels, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as\nspecific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the\ninfomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the\ngeneration process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing\nthe watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to\nbalance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve\nstrong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which\ndegrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile\nfor real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a\ntwo-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike\nprior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances\nrobustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while\nrandomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our\ntwo-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly\ngenerated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on\ndiffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show\nthat it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity.

The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints\non the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source.\nExtensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate\nthat TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions,\nhighlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTraceTrans\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u672f\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u89e3\u5256\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTraceTrans\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7ffb\u8bd1\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u65bd\u52a0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7f8e\u5bb9\u548c\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTraceTrans\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u672f\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "TraceTrans\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,\nefficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.\nConvolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of\nvoxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature\nmatching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct\ncorrespondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin\nneighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to\nexcessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent\nlocality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range\ncorrespondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a\nRecurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching\nregion toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is\nperformed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search\nregion, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations.

To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image\ncaptioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and\nfurther propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),\nwhich models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\nHowever, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant\ncomputational hurdle.

Here, we move beyond this dichotomy and\nsystematically explore outcomes across the full range of group sizes. We focus\non multi-agent misalignment, building on recent evidence that interacting LLMs\nplaying a simple coordination game can generate collective biases absent in\nindividual models. First, we show that collective bias is a deeper phenomenon\nthan previously assessed: interaction can amplify individual biases, introduce\nnew ones, or override model-level preferences.

However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process\nin those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based\noptimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.\nAs a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep\nseparately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)\noptimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,\nenabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation\nthrough the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to\nmonitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if\ndesired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which\nconvergence to the global optimum is guaranteed.

To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and\nTransition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for\nrigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in\nobject states in diverse situations.

These tasks are defined over our fully\nhand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state\ndescriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a\nlarge-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million\nsemi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest\nresource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and\nreveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to\ncapture subtle object state distinctions.

In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image\nembeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance\ncollapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption\nseverity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance\ndegradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification\naccuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the\nstructure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the\nvisual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute\nclass-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We\nfurther show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from\npseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,\nwe propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes\npseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and\na gradient accumulator.

To create challenging distractors, we\npropose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and\nAdversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that\nselects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model\nconfusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the\nhighest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).\nThe strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both\nthe dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian\ncommonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English\nHellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human\nsolvability.

Preprint version under review in the area of\n  Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "summary": "This paper presents a real-time modular defense system named Sentra-Guard.\nThe system detects and mitigates jailbreak and prompt injection attacks\ntargeting large language models (LLMs). The framework uses a hybrid\narchitecture with FAISS-indexed SBERT embedding representations that capture\nthe semantic meaning of prompts, combined with fine-tuned transformer\nclassifiers, which are machine learning models specialized for distinguishing\nbetween benign and adversarial language inputs. It identifies adversarial\nprompts in both direct and obfuscated attack vectors. A core innovation is the\nclassifier-retriever fusion module, which dynamically computes context-aware\nrisk scores that estimate how likely a prompt is to be adversarial based on its\ncontent and context. The framework ensures multilingual resilience with a\nlanguage-agnostic preprocessing layer. This component automatically translates\nnon-English prompts into English for semantic evaluation, enabling consistent\ndetection across over 100 languages. The system includes a HITL feedback loop,\nwhere decisions made by the automated system are reviewed by human experts for\ncontinual learning and rapid adaptation under adversarial pressure.\nSentra-Guard maintains an evolving dual-labeled knowledge base of benign and\nmalicious prompts, enhancing detection reliability and reducing false\npositives. Evaluation results show a 99.96% detection rate (AUC = 1.00, F1 =\n1.00) and an attack success rate (ASR) of only 0.004%. This outperforms leading\nbaselines such as LlamaGuard-2 (1.3%) and OpenAI Moderation (3.7%). Unlike\nblack-box approaches, Sentra-Guard is transparent, fine-tunable, and compatible\nwith diverse LLM backends. Its modular design supports scalable deployment in\nboth commercial and open-source environments.

Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on\nimportance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative\ngradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we\nintroduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO\nframeworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a\nbalanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping\nproperly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a\ngradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,\npreventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these\ndesigns act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and\nsubstantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL\nregularization.

Conventional iterative approaches linearize a\nhighly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal\nequations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal\nestimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO\nframework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed\nPGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where\neach action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner\ndecomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent\nedge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating\nto denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid\npolicy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local\ngraph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to\nproduce a globally consistent estimate.

Research on LLM pruning\noften ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and\ncalibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,\naccordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on\npreserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting\nperformance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple\nyet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific\ncapabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how\nconventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain\ncalibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature\ndistributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.\nThus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and\ntask-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive\ngroups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to\nguide the pruning process.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,\ngeneral-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic\nclassroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on\nsentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,\ninterpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword\ntokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings\nunder a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our\nresults demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and\neven super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and\nsurpassing the average human-human rater correlation.

Methods: A\nlightweight node integrates surface EMG (1 kHz), IMU (100--200 Hz), and\nflex/force sensors with on-device INT8 inference (Tiny 1D-CNN/Transformer) and\na safety-bounded assist policy (angle/torque/jerk limits; stall/time-out).\nHealthy adults (n = 12) performed three ADL-like tasks. Primary outcomes:\nTremor Index (TI), range of motion (ROM), repetitions (Reps min$^{-1}$).\nSecondary: EMG median-frequency slope (fatigue trend), closed-loop latency,\nsession completion, and device-related adverse events. Analyses used\nsubject-level paired medians with BCa 95\\% CIs; exact Wilcoxon $p$-values are\nreported in the Results. Results: Assistance was associated with lower tremor\nprominence and improved task throughput: TI decreased by $-0.092$ (95\\% CI\n[$-0.102$, $-0.079$]), ROM increased by $+12.65\\%$ (95\\% CI [$+8.43$,\n$+13.89$]), and Reps rose by $+2.99$ min$^{-1}$ (95\\% CI [$+2.61$, $+3.35$]).\nMedian on-device latency was 8.7 ms at a 100 Hz loop rate; all sessions were\ncompleted with no device-related adverse events. Conclusions: Multimodal\nsensing with low-latency, safety-bounded assistance produced improved movement\nquality (TI $\\downarrow$) and throughput (ROM, Reps $\\uparrow$) in a pilot\ntechnical-feasibility setting, supporting progression to IRB-approved patient\nstudies.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays.

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

Our approach\nprogressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an\nimproved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of\nthe training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a\nresource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score\nperformance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical\nimage segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score\nperformance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a\nnotable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves\nupon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically\nsignificant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,\nacross all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the\nconstant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously\nreducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced\nfor highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks.

However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is\noften inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of\nfaithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to\nthe RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved\nvision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information\ninto its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual\ninformation. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by\nmeasuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts\nare intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged\nunder visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,\nindicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze\nvisual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that\nquantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability\nand sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current\nMCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component\nCause Model (SCCM) learning.

Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally\nconstrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to\nreproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train\nand test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models\ntrained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.\nAs policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,\nsince defining \"success\" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of\nexecution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework\nthat overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale\nsimulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging\nadvances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and\ndifferentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video\ndemonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.\nWithin these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated\nVLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from\ncrowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,\nresetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To\nmeasure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along\nmultiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy\ngeneralization under controlled variation.

This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic\nand unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation\nmethods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective\nurban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:\nlow-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and\nhigh-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we\npropose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework\ndesigned for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy\nroute waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently\nplans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels\nof navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.
