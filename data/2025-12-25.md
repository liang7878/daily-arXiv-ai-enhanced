Conclusion: 建立了在资源受限的物联网设备上部署自适应AI的实用框架，无需依赖云实现智能家居自动化。

Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

Result: 实验表明该框架提高样本效率、加速收敛、增强覆盖性能且保持鲁棒性，相比经典方法在探索-利用间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 所提量子启发框架在多智能体强化学习用于无人机辅助6G网络部署中有显著优势。

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多模态知识图谱的RAG方法，结合视觉线索实现跨模态推理，实验显示性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG因上下文窗口受限难以处理长文档深度推理，基于KG的RAG仅支持文本输入，未能利用视觉等多模态信息，需解决跨模态推理问题。

Method: 将视觉线索融入知识图谱构建、检索和答案生成过程。

Result: 在全局和细粒度问答任务实验中，该方法在文本和多模态语料上均优于现有基于RAG的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态知识图谱RAG方法能实现跨模态推理，提升内容理解能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Abstract: Foundation model reliability assessment typically requires thousands of evaluation examples, making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for real-world deployment. We introduce microprobe, a novel approach that achieves comprehensive reliability assessment using only 100 strategically selected probe examples. Our method combines strategic prompt diversity across five key reliability dimensions with advanced uncertainty quantification and adaptive weighting to efficiently detect potential failure modes. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage. Our approach addresses a critical gap in efficient model evaluation for responsible AI deployment.

Conclusion: 推理模型的可互换性是一种新兴行为属性，为协作式AI系统中可靠的模块化推理提供新见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI-driven applications powered by large language models has led to a surge in AI interaction data, raising urgent challenges in security, accountability, and risk traceability. This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

### [9] [Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20650)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS)架构，通过学习路由为每个令牌动态选择最优注意力方案，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型中注意力机制在建模质量和推理效率间存在权衡，现有方法各有优劣，需新方案平衡。

Method: 提出MoAS架构，用学习路由为每个令牌动态选择MHA、GQA或MQA。

Result: 在WikiText - 2上，动态路由（验证损失2.3074）优于静态混合（2.3093）。

Conclusion: 动态路由比静态平均方案效果好，能达到与MHA基线相当的性能，且有条件计算效率潜力。

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大语言模型存在记忆局限，如上下文窗口受限等，制约持续对话和个性化服务。

Method: 提出Memory Bear系统，构建基于认知科学原则的类人记忆架构，整合多模态信息感知、动态内存维护和自适应认知服务，对大语言模型记忆机制进行全链路重建。

Result: Memory Bear在医疗、企业运营、教育等领域有工程创新和性能突破，显著提高长期对话中知识保真度和检索效率，降低幻觉率，增强上下文适应性和推理能力，在关键指标上优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: Memory Bear系统推动AI从“记忆”迈向“认知”，是重要的进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face inherent limitations in memory, including restricted context windows, long-term knowledge forgetting, redundant information accumulation, and hallucination generation. These issues severely constrain sustained dialogue and personalized services. This paper proposes the Memory Bear system, which constructs a human-like memory architecture grounded in cognitive science principles. By integrating multimodal information perception, dynamic memory maintenance, and adaptive cognitive services, Memory Bear achieves a full-chain reconstruction of LLM memory mechanisms. Across domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and education, Memory Bear demonstrates substantial engineering innovation and performance breakthroughs. It significantly improves knowledge fidelity and retrieval efficiency in long-term conversations, reduces hallucination rates, and enhances contextual adaptability and reasoning capability through memory-cognition integration. Experimental results show that, compared with existing solutions (e.g., Mem0, MemGPT, Graphiti), Memory Bear outperforms them across key metrics, including accuracy, token efficiency, and response latency. This marks a crucial step forward in advancing AI from "memory" to "cognition".

Result: 在64名实际申请人的评估中，系统每合格候选人用时1.70小时，低于经验丰富招聘者的3.33小时，筛选成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 系统提高招聘吞吐量，降低成本，同时保留人类决策者的最终决定权。

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

<details>

Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在情感分析某些场景准确率不佳，因主要关注常见词而忽略关键术语

Method: 提出AFA训练机制，结合动态掩码策略欺骗判别器，用策略梯度方法优化注意力分布

Result: 在三个公开数据集实验中取得SOTA结果，用于大语言模型性能提升12.6%

Conclusion: 所提出的AFA训练机制有效，能优化注意力分布提升模型性能

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型行为缺陷，通过实验发现存在懒惰现象，但解码次优性证据有限，模型抗上下文退化能力强，最后给出提升建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化大语言模型存在的懒惰、解码次优性和上下文退化等行为缺陷。

Method: 开展三个对照实验，在多个先进大语言模型上进行测试。

Result: 模型在满足复杂多部分指令时普遍存在懒惰现象；简单推理任务中解码次优性证据有限；200轮混乱对话测试中抗上下文退化能力强。

Conclusion: 遵循详细指令仍是挑战，但现代大语言模型在简单检索场景可缓解部分故障模式，给出减少懒惰和提升多指令遵循度的策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

Motivation: 大语言模型常产生幻觉陈述，基于概率的验证存在根本局限，幻觉常是结构一致性的失败。

Result: 该方法能成功拒绝概率验证器无法检测的‘平滑谎言’。

Conclusion: 明确实施结构约束可确定性地拒绝特定类幻觉，为生成式推理提供神经符号健全性检查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

Method: 识别FTAI和NTAI之间的差距，探讨开发语义语言的起点。

Result: 明确提出需要一种语义语言，可辅助开发者评估AI系统并帮助利益相关者将规范转化为具体步骤。

Conclusion: 给出开发语义语言的关键考量，讨论了评估可信人工智能的未来行动。

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

Motivation: 现有安全基准缺乏对结果驱动的约束违反情况的测试，无法满足高风险环境中确保AI安全和符合人类价值观的需求。

Method: 引入含40个多步任务场景的新基准，设置指令和激励两种变体，对12个大语言模型进行测试。

Result: 12个模型的结果驱动约束违反率在1.3% - 71.4%，9个模型违反率在30% - 50%，能力强的模型也可能违反率高，还存在‘深思熟虑的偏差’。

Conclusion: 在AI模型部署前需要进行更现实的智能体安全训练，以降低其在现实世界的风险。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

Conclusion: 该方法能提升语言模型安全性和实用性，且攻击者模型有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

Result: 在多个连续状态、参数化动作领域，基于抽象的方法使TD(λ)比现有基线实现了更高的样本效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决参数化动作空间的长视野、稀疏奖励问题，提高样本效率。

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

Result: 通过情感框架、逐步揭示和学术论证技术可绕过可靠安全机制，推理配置反而增加利用效果，Claude Opus 4.1在部分用例中优先检测意图。

Conclusion: 当前架构设计存在系统性漏洞，需要向将上下文理解和意图识别作为核心安全能力进行范式转变。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

Motivation: 现有运行时安全防护机制难以应对动态、依赖时间和上下文丰富环境中的隐式风险，需新方法保障具身代理安全。

Method: 提出RoboSafe，在混合长短安全记忆上集成反向反思推理和正向预测推理两个互补推理过程，形成自适应、可验证的安全逻辑。

Result: 在多个代理上的大量实验表明，与领先基线相比，RoboSafe将危险动作减少36.8%，并保持接近原始的任务性能，在物理机械臂上的实际评估也证实其实用性。

Conclusion: RoboSafe是一种有效的具身代理运行时安全防护机制，能在保障安全的同时维持任务性能。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉微血管功能障碍（CMD）临床重要但因依赖侵入性检查而诊断不足，此前无研究用数据驱动方法结合冠状动脉造影量化CMD指标。

Method: 用生理验证的多物理模型生成合成数据集，开发单输入通道编码器 - MLP模型预测IMR、双输入通道编码器 - MLP模型预测CFR，均包含认知不确定性估计。

Result: 数据驱动模型在物理合成数据集上预测精度高，不确定性估计与预测误差正相关，证明CIPs可作为冠状动脉生理的替代信息。

Conclusion: 所提框架有潜力利用常规血管造影实现准确、实时、基于图像的CMD评估，无需侵入性方法。

Abstract: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), characterized by impaired regulation of blood flow in the coronary microcirculation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and is increasingly recognized as a contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating startups is inherently challenging in entrepreneurial finance, where investors confront severe information asymmetry and limited quantitative data. Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.

Method: 提出RHAPSODY中间件，通过统一抽象实现异构工作负载并发执行，组合和协调现有运行时。

Result: 在多个HPC系统上评估，显示引入运行时开销小，能维持大规模异构性，高吞吐量推理工作负载接近线性扩展，在代理工作流中实现数据和控制高效耦合。

Conclusion: RHAPSODY能有效支持异构AI - HPC工作负载的并发执行。

Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.

Conclusion: 可精确刻画许多带全序或等价关系扩展的随机良结构转换系统的计算能力。

Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

Conclusion: AutoHet系统在异构GPU分布式训练中能有效平衡计算和内存使用，表现优于现有DNN训练系统。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

Conclusion: 所提在线框架能在不同现货市场动态和预测质量下自适应选择最佳策略，有效提升效用。

Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

Result: Mesh - Attention在256个GPU上实现最高3.4倍加速（平均2.9倍），最多减少85.4%通信量（平均79.0%），系统扩展时性能优越。

Conclusion: Mesh - Attention算法具有明显优势。

Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

Conclusion: 所提方法在超图三元组计数上优于现有技术，能高效处理大规模动态超图。

Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在k - 服务器问题中，不仅要最小化总移动成本，还要公平分配成本给各个服务器。

Method: 首先定义(α,β) - 公平性概念；离线场景给出确定性算法将最优解转换为公平解；在线场景将竞争算法转换为随机在线算法；研究经典的确定性双覆盖算法（DCA）的公平性。

Result: 离线和在线场景中可在不损失竞争力的情况下实现公平；DCA在直线和k = 2的树度量上是公平的，但在一般树度量上对非空参数不公平。

Conclusion: 在k - 服务器问题中可实现成本公平分配，但在线场景对抗完全自适应对手的公平性问题仍待进一步研究。

Abstract: We initiate a formal study of fairness for the $k$-server problem, where the objective is not only to minimize the total movement cost, but also to distribute the cost equitably among servers. We first define a general notion of $(α,β)$-fairness, where, for parameters $α\ge 1$ and $β\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $α/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $β$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(α,β)$-fair solution for $α= 1 + \varepsilon$ and $β= O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot \log k / \varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot k \log k / \varepsilon)$ term. Here $\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.
  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics.

Result: 证明了存储有界、实际过期时间至少为配置的TTL、攻击者无法使受害者操作成本超过O(k)（均摊）最坏情况，给出Solidity参考实现及测量的燃气成本。

Conclusion: 时间分桶余额记录数据结构实用有效，能解决相关问题。

Abstract: Fungible tokens with time-to-live (TTL) semantics require tracking individual expiration times for each deposited unit. A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity with measured gas costs demonstrating practical efficiency.

Conclusion: 结果基本是最优的，因给出了NP难结果。

Abstract: Finding a smallest subgraph that is k-edge-connected, or augmenting a k-edge-connected graph with a smallest subset of given candidate edges to become (k+1)-edge-connected, are among the most fundamental Network Design problems. They are both APX-hard in general graphs. However, this hardness does not carry over to the planar setting, which is not well understood, except for very small values of k. One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks.
  We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k. By leveraging structural results for minimally k-edge-connected graphs, we further obtain a PTAS for planar k-connectivity augmentation for any constant k. We complement this with an NP-hardness result, showing that our results are essentially optimal.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems are fundamentally fragile: they struggle to solve the Hayekian Information problem (eliciting dispersed private knowledge) and the Hurwiczian Incentive problem (aligning local actions with global objectives), making coordination computationally intractable. I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple "brains", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \mathbf{G}_i = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. By structurally aligning agent self-interest with collective objectives, it provides a provably efficient, auditable and generalizable approach to coordinated, trustworthy and scalable multi-agent intelligence grounded in economic principles.

Result: 单胜者设计中激励设计不可能或规模受限，多胜者设计有简单明确条件使两目标达成。

Conclusion: 多胜者设计在区块链计算基于挑战的协议激励设计上更具优势。

Abstract: Blockchains offer a decentralized and secure execution environment strong enough to host cryptocurrencies, but the state-replication model makes on-chain computation expensive. To avoid heavy on-chain workloads, systems like Truebit and optimistic rollups use challenge-based protocols, performing computations off-chain and invoking the chain only when challenged. This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence. Our results are clear: in single-winner designs, the incentive design is impossible or limited in scale. By contrast, in multi-winner designs, we obtain simple, explicit conditions under which both goals hold.

Motivation: 多智能体任务中策略动态适应面临挑战，现有深度强化学习范式存在“表征瓶颈”，难以直接基于对手策略调整。

Method: 将策略表示为人类可解释的源代码，利用大语言模型作为近似解释器，提出PIBR算法，通过文本梯度优化策略代码。

Result: 该方法有效解决了几个标准协调矩阵游戏和合作的基于等级的觅食环境问题。

Conclusion: 以程序代码表示策略结合大语言模型的方法能有效应对多智能体任务中策略动态适应挑战。

Abstract: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出用于零样本组合图像检索（ZS - CIR）的无训练、即插即用过滤模块SoFT，构建数据集管道优化基准测试，在多个数据集上提升了检索指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZS - CIR方法使用单一融合查询会稀释关键信息，未考虑用户想避免的内容，且当前CIR基准测试假设每个查询只有一个正确目标，忽视了修改文本的模糊性。

Method: 提出SoFT模块，利用多模态大语言模型从参考 - 修改对中提取规定性和禁止性约束作为语义过滤器对候选图像重新排序；构建两阶段数据集管道，确定多个合理目标并改写修改文本。

Result: 在CIReVL上应用SoFT，在CIRR、CIRCO和FashionIQ数据集上提升了R@5、mAP@50和R@50等指标。

Conclusion: SoFT具有广泛有效性，能在不同模糊度下更全面可靠地评估。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image that aligns with user intent, expressed through a reference image and a modification text. While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决现实推荐系统中MNAR问题导致推荐列表多样性降低，且传统IPS方法过度惩罚热门物品的问题。

Method: 重新定义倾向得分，将sigmoid函数应用于物品观察频率的对数，将其融入线性自编码器模型。

Result: 方法显著提高了推荐列表中物品的多样性，且未牺牲推荐准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的重新定义倾向得分的方法有效，能在不损失准确性的前提下提升推荐多样性。

Abstract: In real-world recommender systems, user-item interactions are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), as interactions with popular items are more frequently observed than those with less popular ones. Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results revealed that our method substantially improves the diversity of items in the recommendation list without sacrificing recommendation accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态顺序推荐应用中存在可解释性不足、计算成本高、忽略协作信号等问题，需要新方法平衡推荐性能、可解释性和计算成本。

Method: 先用MLLM将物品总结为关键词，用包含总结长度、信息损失和重建难度的奖励微调模型，再将协作信号转换为关键词并整合为补充上下文，最后用多任务学习进行监督微调使MLLM适应多模态顺序推荐。

Result: 在常见推荐数据集上的评估证明了MMSRARec能有效、可解释地理解用户行为历史和物品信息以进行准确推荐。

Conclusion: MMSRARec是一种有效的多模态顺序推荐方法，能解决当前局限性，实现高效且可解释的推荐。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation systems. However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations.

Conclusion: 领域感知的嵌入能大规模提升相关性和效率，为大语言模型时代的搜索体验奠定基础。

Abstract: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

Conclusion: 该框架为分层书籍类型分析中利用结构化和非结构化文本数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

Result: 在淘宝排名系统部署后，IPV和CTR提升超6.0%，订单提升超2.9%，GMV提升超2.5%。

Conclusion: 基于世界知识增强推理的方法比纯日志驱动方法更有效。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

Conclusion: 外部潜在空间可在不修改模型参数时为语言智能体提供低成本、可扩展和可解释的抽象策略表示。

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

Method: 将因果自注意力解释为线性、依赖历史的递归，分析其处理时间信息的方式，并通过一系列线性和非线性案例研究。

Result: 对于线性系统，softmax注意力的凸性约束限制可表征的动力学类别，在振荡环境中导致过平滑；对于部分可观测的非线性系统，注意力作为自适应延迟嵌入机制，在有足够时间上下文和潜在维度时可有效重建状态。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于将实证观察与经典动力系统理论联系起来，揭示Transformer作为动力系统模型何时成功或失败的原因。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI编码代理方法将LLM与代理本身界限模糊，导致系统易出现随机故障，如操控单元测试或产生语法幻觉。

Method: 借鉴软件工程实践，设定控制边界，将LLM视为环境组件；提出双状态架构，分离工作流状态和环境状态；采用原子动作对，将生成与验证耦合；使用防护函数将概率输出映射到可观测工作流状态。

Result: 在13个不同参数规模的LLM上进行的三个代码生成任务中，对于合格的指令跟随模型，任务成功率最多提高66个百分点，计算成本为基线的1.2 - 2.1倍。

Conclusion: 架构约束在实现可靠代码生成方面可以替代参数规模。

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

TL;DR: 提出SHRP结构化剪枝框架，处理Transformer编码器冗余问题，实验表明能在减参同时保持较高准确率并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer编码器高推理延迟和内存消耗在实时服务和可扩展性方面有挑战，源于架构冗余，需进行结构化模型压缩。

Method: 提出SHRP框架，引入Expert Attention设计，将每个注意力头视为独立专家，用轻量级共享扩展器前馈网络优化输出，采用统一Top - 1使用驱动机制进行训练时动态路由和部署时确定性剪枝。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试上，SHRP达到原模型93%准确率，减参48%；极端压缩场景下保持84%准确率，吞吐量提升4.2倍，计算量降至原FLOPs的11.5%。

Conclusion: SHRP对大规模和对延迟敏感的Web部署有实用价值。

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

TL;DR: 提出分层自回归模型PHOTON替代Transformer的扁平扫描，减少解码时KV缓存流量，提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer水平逐令牌扫描导致预填充延迟增加，长上下文解码受内存限制，KV缓存读写影响推理吞吐量。

Method: 提出PHOTON模型，维护潜在流的层次结构，通过自底向上编码器压缩令牌，并由轻量级自顶向下解码器重建细粒度令牌表示。

Result: PHOTON在吞吐量 - 质量权衡方面优于基于Transformer的竞争语言模型，在长上下文和多查询任务中优势明显，每单位内存吞吐量提高达 $10^{3}$ 倍。

Conclusion: PHOTON能有效减少KV缓存流量，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

Motivation: 大语言模型在物理世界推理能力提升，但缺乏评估其生成科学有效物理模型能力的严格基准。

Method: 引入计算力学基准FEM - Bench，包含与计算力学研究生入门课程相关的任务。

Result: 最擅长函数编写的Gemini 3 Pro完成部分任务，最擅长单元测试编写的GPT - 5平均联合成功率为73.8%，其他模型表现差异大。

Conclusion: FEM - Bench为评估AI生成的科学代码奠定基础，未来将随模型发展纳入更复杂任务。

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型中自注意力子层可移除的原因，实现高效、数据无关的模型压缩。

Method: 提出Gate - Norm，这是一种根据查询 - 键耦合对注意力子层排序并移除耦合最小子层的一次性、仅权重准则。

Result: 在40层、13B参数的LLaMA模型上，Gate - Norm能在不到一秒内完成剪枝，移除8 - 16个注意力子层可使推理吞吐量提高至多1.30倍，同时保持平均零样本准确率在未剪枝基线的2%以内。

Conclusion: Gate - Norm在准确率上与数据驱动的剪枝方法相当，且评分速度快约1000倍，可实现大语言模型实用、无数据的压缩。

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

Result: UDE模型数据效率高，只需20%数据正确预测，NODE需90%。

Conclusion: UDE模型在解决n体问题上数据效率远高于NODE模型。

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: FOTON是有效的前向训练算法，为高级架构应用提供可能。

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to

  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 当前多模态假新闻检测依赖一致性融合存在问题，提出DCCF框架，实验显示其优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于一致性的多模态假新闻检测范式将关键跨模态差异误判为噪声，导致过平滑，稀释造假证据，需要改进。

Method: 提出动态冲突 - 共识框架（DCCF），将输入解耦到事实和情感空间，利用物理启发的特征动力学迭代极化表示，采用冲突 - 共识机制结合全局上下文判断。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验表明，DCCF始终优于现有基线，平均准确率提高3.52%。

Conclusion: DCCF能有效解决现有一致性融合范式的问题，提升多模态假新闻检测效果。

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

Conclusion: 研究结果使从业者无需定制测试即可评估显著性，在对照实验中检测更小效应。

Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

Motivation: 现有移动端视觉语言模型训练计算需求大，标准LoRA能力不足，需新的微调方法。

Method: 引入HyDRA框架，采用分层优化（粗粒度给各层分配不同秩、细粒度调整每层内的秩）和动态调整（用轻量级性能模型自动确定和调整秩）策略。

Result: 在流行基准测试中，HyDRA始终优于基线，不同模型尺寸下提升4.7%，部分任务超全参数微调，且不增加可训练参数。

Conclusion: HyDRA是一种有效的移动端视觉语言模型参数高效微调框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 近期方法的改进可能更多归因于数据和架构的差异。

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 当前对RLVR产生稳健泛化的条件了解不足，本文旨在研究其在因果图模型概率推理场景中的泛化情况。

Method: 构建涵盖不同难度轴的因果图和查询数据集，使用RLVR或SFT微调Qwen - 2.5 - Instruct模型，改变模型规模和训练中的查询级别。

Result: RLVR在特定模型大小和训练查询级别组合下，比SFT有更强的同级别和跨级别泛化能力；RLVR的有效性依赖于模型初始推理能力，初始能力足够时能提升LLM边缘化策略和减少中间概率计算错误。

Conclusion: RLVR可提高特定因果推理子技能，但其优势仅在模型有足够初始能力时才会显现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

Result: 在能源领域应用，为在现实约束下比较基础模型提供了可持续基础设施，平台原型可在指定链接获取。

Conclusion: TS - Arena平台能恢复预测评估的完整性，可对模型泛化能力进行真实评估。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

Abstract: This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.

Conclusion: 所提出的防御系统能有效增强模型对对抗性威胁的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.

Conclusion: 自定义Triton内核能有效解决BLR方法多令牌推理的内存瓶颈问题，提升推理性能和压缩模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

TL;DR: 提出DiEC方法，通过从预训练扩散U - Net读取内部激活进行无监督聚类，在多标准基准上有竞争力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度聚类用单一编码器生成固定嵌入，忽略预训练扩散模型在网络层次和噪声时间步上的表示轨迹，不同阶段可聚类性差异大。

Method: 将表示选择构建为层和时间步的二维搜索并分解为两阶段，先固定瓶颈层为CML，再用OTS确定最优时间步t*；训练时提取t*的瓶颈特征并通过轻量级残差映射获得聚类表示；优化DEC风格的KL自训练目标，增加自适应图正则化和熵正则化；引入去噪一致性分支。

Result: DiEC在多个标准基准上取得有竞争力的聚类性能。

Conclusion: DiEC方法有效，能利用预训练扩散模型的内部激活进行无监督聚类。

Abstract: Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测和解释可在图上表示的组合优化问题的计算难度。

Method: 框架分两阶段，第一阶段创建含图特征和难度分类的数据集，用机器学习分类算法训练；第二阶段用关联规则挖掘算法解释预测，训练回归模型预测计算时间。

Conclusion: GCO - HPIF框架在预测和解释方面都很有用。

Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.

Method: 引入RevFFN，采用精心设计的可逆Transformer块，在反向传播时从输出重建层输入激活，无需在内存中存储大部分中间激活。

Result: 显著降低全参数微调的峰值内存消耗。

Conclusion: RevFFN能在单消费级或服务器级GPU上实现高效全参数微调。

Abstract: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

Conclusion: 可根据得出的缩放定律合理规划数据集生成成本和模型训练预算。

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.

Abstract: We present an operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations, which are integro-differential equations defined on functionals. Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.

Abstract: De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

Conclusion: GLiBRL方法是一种有效且性能良好的深度贝叶斯强化学习方法。

Abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) provides a framework for generalisation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems from its use of Bayesian task parameters in the transition and reward models. However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

Abstract: This study proposes a unified forecasting framework for high-dimensional multi-task time series to meet the prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks. The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

Motivation: 随机选举超时在长尾延迟、抖动和分区恢复时变得脆弱，重复分裂投票会增加不可用性，需要更好的机制。

Method: 使用高效线性上下文多臂老虎机（LinUCB变体）从离散的超时“臂”集合中选择，并通过安全探索增强学习以控制不稳定时期的风险。

Result: 在具有长尾延迟、丢包、相关突发、节点异构和分区/恢复动荡的离散事件模拟中，BALLAST在具有挑战性的广域网场景下大幅减少恢复时间和不可写时间，在稳定的局域网/广域网设置中也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: BALLAST是一种轻量级在线自适应机制，能有效改善Raft在复杂网络环境下的活性。

Abstract: Randomized election timeouts are a simple and effective liveness heuristic for Raft, but they become brittle under long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, where repeated split votes can inflate unavailability. This paper presents BALLAST, a lightweight online adaptation mechanism that replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits. BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout "arms" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence. Across challenging WAN regimes, BALLAST substantially reduces recovery time and unwritable time compared to standard randomized timeouts and common heuristics, while remaining competitive on stable LAN/WAN settings.

Result: IU - GEPSVM在(O vs S)任务中峰值准确率85%、平均准确率81.29%，在(Z vs S)任务中峰值准确率80%、平均准确率77.57%。

Conclusion: IU - GEPSVM优于基线方法，可用于EEG信号分类。

Abstract: The paper presents novel Universum-enhanced classifiers: the Universum Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal Support Vector Machine (U-GEPSVM) and the Improved U-GEPSVM (IU-GEPSVM) for EEG signal classification. Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: 框架提供统一动态描述，明确架构和算法选择对鲁棒性和敏感性的作用，并为后续扩展奠定基础。

Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

Motivation: 模型合并作为轻量级多任务学习替代方案，其泛化性缺乏理论保障，现有方法依赖启发式且性能不稳定。

Method: （1）建立针对模型合并的平坦感知PAC - Bayes泛化界；（2）将模型合并建模为稀缺无标签数据上的多教师知识蒸馏；（3）用SAMerging方法通过Sharpness - Aware Minimization找到平坦最小值。

Result: SAMerging在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到新的SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 提出的理论和方法有效提升了模型合并的泛化性能。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a "cross-task heterogeneity" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond

Conclusion: 该方法能直接在神经数据所在处求解表面PDE，无需显式网格化或按实例优化，保留可微性

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Data-driven analysis of business processes has a long tradition in research. However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.

Conclusion: 结合单一结构化工具与强化学习训练，为仓库级问题定位提供高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了大语言模型在面对与明确指令冲突的上下文信号时的行为适应方式，有助于理解模型如何协调预训练目标和对齐约束。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

Abstract: Historically, financial risk management has mostly addressed risk factors that arise from the financial environment. Climate risks present a novel and significant challenge for companies and financial markets. Investors aiming for avoidance of firms with high carbon footprints require suitable risk measures and portfolio management strategies. This paper presents the construction of decarbonized indices for tracking the S \& P-500 index of the U.S. stock market, as well as the Indian index NIFTY-50, employing two distinct methodologies and study their performances. These decarbonized indices optimize the portfolio weights by minimizing the mean-VaR and mean-ES and seek to reduce the risk of significant financial losses while still pursuing decarbonization goals. Investors can thereby find a balance between financial performance and environmental responsibilities. Ensuring transparency in the development of these indices will encourage the excluded and under-weighted asset companies to lower their carbon footprints through appropriate action plans. For long-term passive investors, these indices may present a more favourable option than green stocks.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，PALB呈现经验对数线性缩放，比基于LP和IRLS的公开求解器实现更快。

Conclusion: PALB是一种有效解决LAD直线拟合的精确算法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.

Result: 加权指标能区分在高权重观测上表现好的分类器，不受权重选择影响；若权重变化不超过ε，二分类中加权指标值变化至多为ε倍，多分类中为ε²倍。

Conclusion: 新提出的加权指标能有效识别在高权重观测上表现更好的分类器，且对权重选择具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Several performance measures are used to evaluate binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case
  and by a factor of $ε^2$ in the multiclass case.
  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.

Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种仅使用汇总的展示级数据的因果驱动归因（CDA）框架，避免依赖用户标识符或点击路径跟踪，在合成数据上验证了准确性，提供了可解释、保护隐私的归因见解。

Motivation: 现有营销归因方法大多依赖用户级路径数据，而这些数据因隐私法规和平台限制越来越难获取。

Method: CDA框架结合时间因果发现（使用PCMCI）和结构因果模型进行因果效应估计，以恢复渠道间的方向性关系并量化其对转化的贡献。

Result: 在给定真实因果图时，平均相对RMSE为9.50%；使用预测图时为24.23%，在结构正确时准确性高，结构不确定时也能恢复有意义的信号。

Conclusion: CDA能捕捉跨渠道相互依赖关系，提供可解释、保护隐私的归因见解，是传统基于路径模型的可扩展且具前瞻性的替代方案。

Abstract: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

Result: 对于构造可交换测度下的Martin Löf随机序列，调整后的复杂度线性增长并收敛到1；病态构造表明底层测度的规则性很重要。

Conclusion: 提出的框架自然连接了Kolmogorov复杂度、经验熵和随机性，在随机性测试和结构化二进制数据分析中有应用潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.

Motivation: 现有泛基因组分析表示格式存在无法统一单核苷酸和结构变异、难以扩展等问题，需要新的表示方法。

Method: 引入H1等位基因中心表示，通过自适应等位基因压缩编码单倍型成员；引入H2路径中心表示，基于相同的等位基因 - 单倍型关联信息。

Result: 使用真实人类基因组数据表明，该表示方法有显著压缩优势，尤其对于结构变异，且与泛基因组图信息内容等效。

Conclusion: H1为可扩展的泛基因组分析及下游应用提供了统一、考虑人群因素的基础。

Abstract: Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.

Conclusion: 模型存在“聪明汉斯”失败模式，可推断出应分析泄漏源，采用作者不相交拆分及改进数据集实践。

Abstract: Can machine learning models identify which chemist made a molecule from structure alone? If so, models trained on literature data may exploit chemist intent rather than learning causal structure-activity relationships. We test this by linking CHEMBL assays to publication authors and training a 1,815-class classifier to predict authors from molecular fingerprints, achieving 60% top-5 accuracy under scaffold-based splitting. We then train an activity model that receives only a protein identifier and an author-probability vector derived from structure, with no direct access to molecular descriptors. This author-only model achieves predictive power comparable to a simple baseline that has access to structure. This reveals a "Clever Hans" failure mode: models can predict bioactivity largely by inferring chemist goals and favorite targets without requiring a lab-independent understanding of chemistry. We analyze the sources of this leakage, propose author-disjoint splits, and recommend dataset practices to decouple chemist intent from biological outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出一种流式优化的4DGS框架AirGS，可提升自由视点视频体验，减少质量偏差、加速训练和降低传输大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4DGS方法在长序列中质量下降，且带宽和存储开销大，限制了实时和大规模应用。

Method: 将高斯视频流转换为多通道2D格式，识别关键帧；结合时间连贯性和膨胀损失；将4DGS交付建模为整数线性规划问题，设计轻量级剪枝级别选择算法。

Result: 场景变化时PSNR质量偏差降低超20%，帧级PSNR始终高于30，训练加速6倍，每帧传输大小降低近50%。

Conclusion: AirGS能实现高质量、低延迟的自由视点视频体验，在性能上优于现有SOTA 4DGS方法。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

Result: 实验显示GNN在多种网络类型中显著优于所测试的其他方法。

Conclusion: GNN在源检测任务中非常有效，流行病源检测可作为评估GNN架构的基准任务。

Abstract: The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.

Method: 提出CELP框架，通过社区感知、置信引导的边补全和剪枝增强图，并集成多尺度结构特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集的实验中，CELP取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 社区结构对提高链接预测准确性起着关键作用。

Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在不同情况下均有效，能解决特征提取中混杂变量的问题。

Abstract: A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.

Abstract: Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

Motivation: 现有公共乳腺超声数据集缺乏可靠元数据，限制了可提示方法的训练和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出NullBUS多模态混合监督框架，引入可空提示处理缺失文本。

Result: 在三个公共乳腺超声数据集上，平均IoU为0.8568，平均Dice为0.9103。

Conclusion: NullBUS在混合提示可用性下达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

Conclusion: DGSAN能有效利用时间变化和多模态数据，提高肺结节分类预测的准确性。

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

Method: 构建Once - for - All风格的ResDets超网，进行迭代进化搜索，交替优化骨干网络和颈部/头部，采用种群传递机制和准确率预测器。

Result: TrashDet - l在五分类TACO子集上达到19.5 mAP50，参数30.5M；TrashDet系列参数范围1.2M - 30.5M，mAP50为11.4 - 19.5；TrashDet - ResNet和TrashDet - MBNet在多方面优于基线。

Conclusion: 该框架生成的TrashDets系列检测器为资源受限硬件上的TinyML部署提供了可扩展的检测选项，在准确率、能耗、延迟等方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

TL;DR: 提出Transductive Visual Programming (TVP)框架解决3D场景空间推理问题，通过经验构建工具，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编程方法依赖固定工具集或推测性工具归纳，导致程序效果不佳和工具利用不足，需要新方法解决3D场景空间推理问题。

Method: TVP先用基本工具解决问题，积累经验解决方案到示例库，再从程序中抽象出可复用的高级工具到工具库。

Result: 在Omni3D - Bench上超越GPT - 4o和之前最佳视觉编程系统；转导学习的工具作为核心程序依赖的使用频率是归纳创建工具的5倍；在SpatialScore - Hard集合基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 经验驱动的转导工具创建是构建自进化视觉编程代理的强大范式，可有效解决具有挑战性的空间推理任务。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/.

Method: 从公开资源整理出包含75个不同生物学研究的多通道显微镜图像的CHAMMI - 75数据集。

Result: 使用CHAMMI - 75训练能提升多通道生物成像任务的性能，因其显微镜模态具有高多样性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生物学研究中下一代细胞形态模型的创建铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

Motivation: 当前手语生成数据驱动方法需要大量精确2D和3D人体姿态数据，但多数手语数据集缺乏准确3D信息，自动3D人体姿态估计质量差，影响生成质量。

Conclusion: DexAvatar框架能有效解决现有手语数据集缺乏准确3D信息和自动3D人体姿态估计质量差的问题，提高手语生成质量。

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval. Documents contain elements that require different recognition methods. Table recognition typically consists of three subtasks, namely table structure, cell position and cell content recognition. Recent models have achieved excellent recognition with a combination of multi-task learning, local attention, and mutual learning. However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference. The superiority is demonstrated both visually and statistically on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: TGC - Net能有效解决现有方法问题，在医学分割中表现出色。

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结合事件引导过滤和长文本视觉语言建模在复杂现实场景中能实现准确高效检索。

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于MCDO的不确定性量化能增强神经网络驱动的计算POC传感系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.

Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.

Method: 使用含随机波动率的时变向量自回归（VAR）模型，对美国经济周期的峰谷期进行分析。

Result: 所有模型估计回弹效应接近100%，能效创新后能源使用减少持续不超三年。

Conclusion: 能效创新不足以有效改变历史能源使用模式。

Abstract: Energy efficiency gains in production and consumption are undisputed economic and environmental goals. However, potential energy savings derived from efficiency innovations may have short-lasting effects due to increased demand for more affordable energy services. Measuring the size of this rebound effect is a critical tool for better assessing the reliability of energy-saving technological change for global warming mitigation. This paper estimates the size of the economy-wide rebound effect using time-varying Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models with stochastic volatility for U.S. business-cycle peak and trough periods. All models estimate a rebound effect close to 100%, with reductions in energy use lasting no longer than three years following energy efficiency innovations. The latter, therefore, are an insufficient tool for effectively changing historical energy use patterns.

Abstract: Purpose: This paper explores gender differences in two distinct forms of risk aversion -- Payoff Risk Aversion (PaRA) and Price Risk Aversion (PrRA) -- in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of how men and women respond to different types of economic uncertainty.
  Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a laboratory experiment using Multiple-Choice-List (MCL) risk-elicitation tasks based on both Direct Utility Function (DUF) and Indirect Utility Function (IUF) frameworks. These tasks present stochastic payoffs and stochastic prices, respectively. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to compare gender-specific responses across three experimental designs.
  Findings: The key results of the study indicate that women typically exhibit higher degrees of PaRA than men, which is a consistent finding with the mainstream literature. However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs. The paper also introduces an 'irrationality gap' as the difference between PaRA and PrRA and explores the size of the irrationality gap within either gender group, finding it larger and statistically significant for men, while smaller and statistically insignificant for women.
  Originality/value: This study is the first to distinguish between PaRA and PrRA in a gender comparison, using experimentally validated methods. It provides new behavioral insights into the nature of gender-specific risk preferences and introduces the irrationality gap as a novel concept with implications for understanding financial decision-making and the design of gender-sensitive economic policies.

Conclusion: 讨论了对投入驱动生产风险建模的影响。

Abstract: The conventional functional form of the Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) production function is a general production function nesting a number of other forms of production functions. Examples of such functions include Leontief, Cobb-Douglas, and linear production functions. Nevertheless, the conventional form of the CES production specification is still restrictive in multiple aspects. One example is the fact that the marginal effect of increasing input use always has to be to increase the variability of output quantity by the conventional construction of this function. This paper proposes a generalized variant of the CES production function that allows for various input effects on the probability distribution of output. Failure to allow for this possible input-output risk structure is indeed one of the limitations of the conventional form of the CES production function. This limitation may result in false inferences about input-driven output risk. In light of this, the present paper proposes a solution to this problem. First, it is shown that the familiar CES formulation suffers from very restrictive structural assumptions regarding risk considerations, and that such restrictions may lead to biased and inefficient estimates of production quantity and production risk. Following the general theme of Just and Pope's approach, a CES-based production-function specification that overcomes this shortcoming of the original CES production function is introduced, and a three-stage Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) estimation procedure for the estimation of the proposed functional form is presented. To illustrate the proposed approaches in this paper, two empirical applications in irrigation and fertilizer response using the famous Hexem-Heady experimental dataset are provided. Finally, implications for modeling input-driven production risks are discussed.

Abstract: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

Motivation: 语言模型生成式建模在TSE中有潜力，需更好方法提升性能。

Method: 采用两阶段解码器生成式LM方法，分离语义和声学；使用连续SSL或编解码器嵌入；采用Frozen - LM Conditioning训练策略和DPO。

Result: 在Libri2Mix实验中，GenTSE在语音质量、可懂度和说话人一致性上超越先前基于LM的系统。

Conclusion: GenTSE是一种有效的TSE方法，能提升语音相关性能。

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.

Conclusion: 提出的新框架能有效解决多智能体决策中因信念不一致带来的问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

Result: 完成了对快速最终性协议设计现状的调研，对单时隙最终性协议瓶颈进行了分析。

Conclusion: 3 - 时隙最终性协议是平衡快速最终性和以太坊网络工程约束的实用方案。

Abstract: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.

Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注针对大语言模型的一般攻击场景，对恶意代码生成作为越狱目标的探索有限，需评估恶意代码生成中安全对齐的弱点。

Method: 提出SPELL框架，采用时分选择策略，从先验知识数据集中智能组合句子来系统构造越狱提示。

Result: 在三个先进代码模型（GPT - 4.1、Claude - 3.5和Qwen2.5 - Coder）上评估，在八个恶意代码类别中攻击成功率分别为83.75%、19.38%和68.12%；生成的提示能在Cursor等工具中产生恶意代码，被先进检测系统确认为恶意的比例超73%。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型实现存在显著安全漏洞，研究结果为改进代码生成应用中的AI安全对齐提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

Motivation: 医疗AI需要多机构数据，但隐私和治理约束使数据难以共享，现存联邦学习部署有隐私和聚合器信任风险。

Method: 构建zkFL - Health架构，结合联邦学习、零知识证明（ZKPs）和可信执行环境（TEEs），客户本地训练，聚合器在TEE中操作并生成ZK证明，验证节点验证证明和记录加密承诺。

Result: 将概述系统和威胁模型、协议、安全/隐私保证和性能评估计划。

Conclusion: 该框架使多机构医疗AI具备强保密性、完整性和可审计性，利于临床应用和法规遵从。

Abstract: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

Conclusion: 所提出的物理攻击方法可行且有效，能在降低目标无人机检测的同时保证合法无人机检测。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.

Conclusion: BCG能为基于FCG的安卓恶意软件分类提供更好支持，可推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Function call graphs (FCGs) have emerged as a powerful abstraction for malware detection, capturing the behavioral structure of applications beyond surface-level signatures. Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets. BCG is publicly available at https://erdemub.github.io/BCG-dataset.

Abstract: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

Result: 实验表明SSAFL能提高模型准确率、加速收敛，比SemiAsyn降低成本27.8%。

Conclusion: FEIBN框架和SSAFL机制有效解决了IBN在IIoT环境中的问题。

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) offers a promising paradigm for intelligent and automated network control in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by translating high-level user intents into executable network strategies. However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.

Abstract: The 6G wireless aims at the Tb/s peak data rates are expected, a sub-millisecond latency, massive Internet of Things/vehicle connectivity, which requires sustainable access to audio over the air and energy-saving functionality. Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

Abstract: Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提出的无随机梯度优化方法可行且有效，能在无限维希尔伯特空间的优化问题中发挥作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.

Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中数据集相对模型规模小产生的过参数化场景下的退化优化问题。

Method: 通过投影将退化优化问题与非退化问题关联，利用代数几何工具。

Result: 发现高度退化情况下投影的分歧轨迹起关键作用，给出计算临界点数量的工具。

Conclusion: 将代数几何工具与机器学习思想结合，拓展了欧几里得距离度相关文献到退化情形。

Abstract: We study the critical points over an algebraic variety of an optimization problem defined by a quadratic objective that is degenerate. This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.

TL;DR: 本文评估处理检索中召回率难计算问题的策略，在多数据集实验，还引入无需相关文档总数知识的检索质量度量方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型且不断演变的知识库检索场景中，查询相关文档总数通常未知，无法计算召回率

Method: 通过测量检索质量指标与基于大语言模型的响应质量判断之间的相关性，评估既定策略；在多个相关文档数量较少的数据集上进行实验

Result: 引入了一种简单的检索质量度量方法，在无需相关文档总数知识的情况下表现良好

Conclusion: 所提出的检索质量度量方法能有效应对检索中召回率难计算的问题

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment. To enhance robustness, we employ efficient data preprocessing and augmentation using large language models while incorporating hard negative sampling to improve representation learning. We evaluate our approach on monolingual and crosslingual benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and fact-checking performance over baselines.

TL;DR: 提出ClarifyMT - Bench多轮澄清基准，发现LLMs有澄清不足偏差，提出ClarifyAgent改进，为研究人-大模型交互中模糊处理提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型澄清基准主要假设单轮交互或用户配合，难以评估现实场景下的澄清行为。

Method: 引入基于五维模糊分类和六种模拟用户角色的多轮澄清基准ClarifyMT - Bench；构建6120个多轮对话；提出ClarifyAgent方法，将澄清分解为感知、预测、跟踪和规划。

Result: 评估十种大语言模型揭示了持续的澄清不足偏差，即大语言模型倾向于过早回答，且随着对话深度增加性能下降；ClarifyAgent在不同模糊条件下显著提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ClarifyMT - Bench为研究大语言模型在人 - 大模型交互中何时提问、何时回答以及如何处理模糊性提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估依赖标准基准测试，其聚合指标会掩盖模型缺陷和基准测试本身的覆盖不平衡问题。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器，提取概念激活并计算基准数据的显著加权性能得分，基于模型内部表示进行评估。

Result: 应用该方法于两个开源模型和十个基准测试，发现模型在特定概念上表现不佳、基准测试存在覆盖不均问题，且与文献观察一致。

Conclusion: 该方法提供基于表示的评估方式，可对基准分数进行概念级分解，补充传统聚合指标。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

Motivation: 基于扩散的长文本生成方法随序列长度增加存在高昂计算成本和内存开销问题。

Method: 引入SA - DiffuSeq框架，集成稀疏注意力，通过选择性分配注意力、使用适应稀疏注意力动态的软吸收状态，稳定扩散轨迹并加速序列重建。

Result: SA - DiffuSeq在训练效率和采样速度上持续超越现有扩散基线，在长序列上提升显著。

Conclusion: 将结构化稀疏性融入扩散模型是高效且富有表现力的长文本生成的有前景方向。

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医学应用受可靠性和安全性担忧限制，现有评估存在不足。

Method: 引入MediEval基准关联EHR与知识库，生成多样医学陈述评估；提出CoRFu微调方法。

Result: 识别出当前LLMs常见失败模式，CoRFu比基础模型提升16.4个宏观F1分数，消除真值反转错误。

Conclusion: CoRFu方法能提高LLMs在医学应用中的准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

Abstract: We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词对语言模型性能和行为的影响难以孤立测量，缺乏相关研究。

Result: TokSuite能有效分离模型分词器的影响。

Conclusion: TokSuite支持一系列新发现，阐明多种流行分词器的优缺点。

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的标记级幻觉检测框架，在多数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型易产生幻觉内容，现有检测方法有局限性，传统线性探针难以捕捉深层语义空间的非线性结构。

Method: 冻结语言模型参数，用轻量级MLP探针建模高层隐藏状态，设计多目标联合损失函数，建立层位置 - 探针性能响应模型并通过贝叶斯优化搜索最佳插入层。

Result: 在LongFact、HealthBench和TriviaQA数据集上，MLP探针在准确率、召回率和低误报条件下的检测能力显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于神经网络的框架能有效进行标记级幻觉检测。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

TL;DR: 提出语言表达能力概念，指出蛋白质语言表达能力限制CoT推理应用，引入反思预训练增强生物语言表达和模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT在非自然语言领域（如蛋白质和RNA语言模型）无法应用的问题，因这些领域语言表达能力有限。

Method: 定义语言表达能力概念，首次在生物序列模型中引入反思预训练，生成辅助“思考标记”。

Result: 理论上增强生物语言表达能力和模型推理能力，实验上使蛋白质模型能自我纠错，比标准预训练有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 反思预训练可有效克服蛋白质语言表达能力限制，提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

Motivation: 在严格计算约束下，系统探究小语言模型的架构选择和训练预算如何影响性能。

Method: 从线性下一个令牌预测器开始，逐步引入非线性、自注意力和多层变压器架构，在Tiny Shakespeare、PTB和WikiText - 2上进行评估，使用测试负对数似然、参数数量和近似训练FLOPs来比较模型。

Result: 基于注意力的模型在小规模下每FLOP效率优于MLP；在没有充分优化的情况下增加深度或上下文可能降低性能；大模型中成功的旋转位置嵌入技术不一定适用于小模型。

Conclusion: 大模型的架构技术不能简单迁移到小模型，注意力模型在小模型中有更好的效率表现。

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理能力蒸馏过程中处理长序列计算成本高的问题。

Result: 训练前50%的训练序列令牌，在数学基准测试中平均可保留约94%的全序列性能，同时将训练时间、内存使用和FLOPs各减少约50%。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏优先考虑早期推理令牌有益，为计算 - 质量权衡提供简单方法。

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）中模型对过长的思维链（CoT）序列关注过多，减少了对关键答案部分的关注，而答案正确性决定任务成败和评估质量。

Method: 提出SFTKey两阶段训练方案，第一阶段进行传统SFT确保输出格式正确，第二阶段仅对关键答案部分微调以提高准确率。

Result: 在多个基准和模型族上的大量实验表明，SFTKey比传统SFT平均准确率提升超过5%，并能保持生成正确格式的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过明确平衡CoT学习和对答案相关标记的额外优化，推动了大语言模型微调的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

Method: 采用以数据为中心视角，将节点语义视为任务自适应变量，提出DAS框架，耦合固定GNN和LLM形成闭环反馈。

Result: 在结构主导图上持续改进，在语义丰富图上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 以数据为中心的语义自适应在结构 - 语义异质性下有效。

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 半监督学习技术可用于改进大语言模型安全任务表现，特定任务增强很重要。

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

Conclusion: 框架的通用性表明长序列的并行生成在不损失建模能力的情况下是可行的。

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

Result: SMART参数比GPT - 2和BERT少，准确率比GPT - 2高21.3%，推理有双模式。

Conclusion: 现实部署中，SMART比同类小变压器模型结果支持性更好，幻觉减少。

Abstract: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

Conclusion: 去噪熵可作为理解和控制生成过程的有效工具，将掩码扩散模型的不确定性转化为发现高质量解决方案的优势。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.

Motivation: 现有日冕仪磁图仅提供环形带几何形状，无法为MHD - SWT模型提供初始化所需的状态向量，需解决这一问题以实现耀斑活动区出现的提前数周预测。

Method: 开发基于物理信息神经网络的活动区分布模拟器PINNBARDS，利用观测环形带和MHD - SWT方程推导初始状态向量。

Result: PINN收敛到与观测匹配的、物理上一致且主要为反对称的环形带；探索不同参数范围解，20 - 30 kG环形磁场和约10度带宽与观测最相符。

Conclusion: PINNBARDS是首个从表面模式重建隐藏的日冕层磁结构状态向量的方法，有潜力提前数周预测耀斑活动区出现。

Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于采样的检查规划器在处理大型复杂结构时需大量内存，且大多为显式环境模型设计。

Method: 提出名为Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM)的一组原始计算方法。

Result: 在三个场景评估中，使用IPIM的基础规划器能生成与最先进规划器质量相似的检查轨迹，且内存使用最多减少70倍。

Conclusion: IPIM让基于采样的检查规划器能在规划中完全使用神经SDF表示，有效减少内存使用。

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标导航（ZSON）方法在现实杂乱环境，如存在遮挡、未知风险或动态目标物体时表现不佳。

Method: 提出受薛定谔不确定思想实验启发的Schrödinger's Navigator框架，利用轨迹条件3D世界模型想象未来观测，将想象观测融合到导航和值地图中引导策略。

Result: 在Go2四足机器人三种挑战性场景下实验表明，该框架在自我定位、目标定位和整体成功率上均优于强ZSON基线。

Conclusion: 轨迹条件3D想象对实现鲁棒零样本目标导航有效。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

Conclusion: LookPlanGraph在处理环境变化上有优势，适用于具身指令跟随任务，GraSIF数据集可提供帮助。

Abstract: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

Result: 方法扩展性好，已用于发现工业协议中的错误，能提供精确、紧凑、易读的规范。

Conclusion: 该逻辑公理化方式为推理、验证、设计改进和协议实现提供新机会。

Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.

Abstract: Social interactions increasingly involve artificial agents, such as conversational or collaborative bots. Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.

Abstract: Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench
