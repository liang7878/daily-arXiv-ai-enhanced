This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges\nthis to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly\nnon-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a\nsignaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the\nclassic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this\nframework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of\npredicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we\nformulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.\nThis model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing\nframing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable.

To overcome these challenges, SplitFed\nLearning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths\nof FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,\nand security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:\nSharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning\n(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by\ndistributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across\nmultiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized\nserver with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven\nconsensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security.

Recent\nadvances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which\nalleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the\ncollapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current\ndiffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,\nwhich is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference\ndata in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in\ndiscrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based\nrecommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user\npreferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing\ndiffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of\npreference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item\npairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.\nThis formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature\nof recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of\ninjecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the\npreferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --\nthereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference\nreconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by\niteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.\nPreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical\nguarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across\nfive benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and\nempirical effectiveness."}

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation.

However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference.

Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex\nsemantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD\ntools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine\nwidely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing\nGPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further\ntest these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench\nand SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between\ntraditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical\nCCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,\nretain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some\nexhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks.

To reduce inference\ncost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model\n(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for\neach query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the\nscarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified\nlabels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM\nresponses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based\ndata, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and\nmore scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We\ncast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and\npreference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response\nevaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further\nreveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known\ncausal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect.

While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS).

In this work, we introduce\nMAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing\nmultimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for\nalignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete\nmodality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these\napproaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary\nmodality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large\n(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in\narbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-\nand cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic\ntokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal\nsequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting\ncross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality\ncombinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets\nspanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%\nand 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,\nrespectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with\nup to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.\nFurther analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's\nsparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series."}

To\nidentify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of\nfault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution\ntrace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same\ntest w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which\nare considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.\n  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake\nemploys a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes\nfaults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood\nof uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly\nconnecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,\nCSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the\ncompatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault\npropagations with low overhead.\n  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five\nsystems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed."}

A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the\nscarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified\nlabels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM\nresponses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based\ndata, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and\nmore scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We\ncast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and\npreference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response\nevaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further\nreveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known\ncausal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new\nperspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that\ncorrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and\nimprove routing robustness and efficiency.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction.

The research contributes to the\nrecent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management\nsimulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework\nis used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free\nonline interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes\ndecisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management\nsimulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental\nenvironment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured\nprompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are\ntasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing\nbudget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales\nforecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on\nquantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM\ndecisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market\nchanges, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows\nto move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term\ndecision-making."}

In this work, we revisit the\nfoundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a\nsimple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by\naggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This\nobservation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure\nnaturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on\nthis insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN\nencoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node\nfeature noise.

Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering\noutcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with\nsignificant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their\narms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the\nfirst challenge.

Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data.

However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM\nquickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and\nprogress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the\nclipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,\nwhile clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the\neffect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even\nwhen purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings\nhighlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward\nsignal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the\nreasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be\ndeliberately used to control entropy.

We further\ndesign specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key\nmeteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall\nevents, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major\narchitectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and\ntemporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus\nPrecipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates\ndomain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting.

An Experimental Analysis of Democratic and Autocratic Biases in Large-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting\ndistinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,\nranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human\nsocieties, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those\nsocieties. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents\ntrained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political\nassumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent\nwith democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through\nexperimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed\nacross disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and\npolitical orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring\nand qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high\nmodel-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture\nof the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the\nneed for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded\nwithin AI systems."}

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning.

Under review", "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their\ninherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to\nautoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise\nsemi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their\nnatural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.\nHowever, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional\nsemi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding\noverhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current\nblock is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where\nlow-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading\nto incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

Based on 54 experiments across\ndiverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,\ndata volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance.

Given a fixed amount of training data, larger\nmodels achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In\ndata-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly\neffective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of\noptimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples.

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups.

Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering\noutcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with\nsignificant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce\nautonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns\nand accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior\nknowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic\nannealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally\npromotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to\nexploitation later.

Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training\neffectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL\npolicy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which\nthat policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that\nmid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the\neffective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the\nspace of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these\ninsights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable\nmid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower\nbound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent\nstructures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.\nExperiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on\nHumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token\nprediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher\nasymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and\nCodeforces."}

ZeroDFL employs an iterative\nprompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual\nprompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication\noverhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,\ndemonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par\nwith--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,\nZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while\nreducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results\nhighlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated\nzero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy\npreservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large\nvision-language models in real-world applications."}

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

Under review", "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their\ninherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to\nautoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise\nsemi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their\nnatural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.\nHowever, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional\nsemi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding\noverhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current\nblock is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where\nlow-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading\nto incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time\noptimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and\nconfidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs."}

However, to date, there exist no\nreliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or\noutdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor\naccess points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and\nreducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate\nindoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling\nautomatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To\nthis end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for\nI/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and\nhighly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and\ndistinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various\nmethodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning\napproaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse\ngeographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone\ncan achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)\ndata, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of\nGNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,\nshowcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion."}

This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies\nhow much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for\ninference at test time.

Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible\nyet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a\nstrategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text\ngeneration.

We derive regret\nbounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly\nconnecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We\nvalidate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing\nit achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online\npreference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for\ndesigning more sample-efficient interactive agents."}

To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework\nthat operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on\naudience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423\nhuman-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality\ndimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our\nevaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from\npairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still\nunderperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial\nimprovements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,\nand multi-task learning approaches.

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens\nof thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing\nand evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally\ninfeasible.

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

Further, we observe that larger models reconverge\nfaster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually\nreconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to\nlearn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token\nfrequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is\nuneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words\nconverge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens\nand content words).
