### [1] [Leibniz's Monadology as Foundation for the Artificial Age Score: A Formal Architecture for Al Memory Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17541)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文基于莱布尼茨的《单子论》构建评估人工记忆系统的框架，有数学证明和哲学依据，还可用于构建AI记忆架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个数学严谨、有哲学基础的框架来评估人工记忆系统。

Method: 将《单子论》的20个核心命题映射到信息论架构，用平滑对数变换得到相关指标，把经典形而上学概念重新表述，将逻辑原则编码为正则化约束。

Result: 得出一组关于细化不变性、结构可分解性和尺度变换单调性的第一性原理证明，框架按《单子论》分为六个主题束。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅可用于评估，还能为构建模块化、可解释且合理的AI记忆架构提供蓝图。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.

### [2] [Fluid Grey 2: How Well Does Generative Adversarial Network Learn Deeper Topology Structure in Architecture That Matches Images?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17643)
*Yayan Qiu,Sean Hanna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出检测pix2pix学习拓扑关系能力的方法，证明其可自动学习空间拓扑关系并应用于建筑设计，检测方法简单且耗时短，未来可为相关应用提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和图形的GAN在建筑设计和城市更新中存在模型嵌套和数据转换导致信息损失问题，需简化工具，且要证明I2I GAN有自主识别拓扑关系的潜力。

Method: 在GAN前后添加两个基于Grasshopper的检测模块，提供定量数据并可视化学习过程，研究不同输入模式对学习效率的影响。

Result: 证明pix2pix能自动学习空间拓扑关系并应用于建筑设计，填补从拓扑角度检测基于图像生成的GAN性能的空白，检测方法耗时短且操作简单，检测模块可用于定制数据集和批量检测。

Conclusion: 该研究未来可为使用GAN保留空间拓扑特征的建筑设计和城市更新应用提供理论基础和数据支持。

Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风险敏感领域的人工智能需兼顾准确性与透明度、伦理等，混合神经符号模型适合该场景。

Method: 对混合架构、伦理设计考量和部署模式进行调研，介绍知识图谱与深度推理集成等技术，结合医疗、金融等领域案例研究。

Result: 展示了混合系统能在风险敏感领域提供可靠且可审计的人工智能。

Conclusion: 给出评估协议和在复杂高风险环境中扩展神经符号框架的未来方向。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployed in risk-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and security must not only achieve predictive accuracy but also ensure transparency, ethical alignment, and compliance with regulatory expectations. Hybrid neuro symbolic models combine the pattern-recognition strengths of neural networks with the interpretability and logical rigor of symbolic reasoning, making them well-suited for these contexts. This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI. Finally, we outline evaluation protocols and future directions for scaling neuro symbolic frameworks in complex, high stakes environments.

### [4] [KGpipe: Generation and Evaluation of Pipelines for Data Integration into Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18364)
*Marvin Hofer,Erhard Rahm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出KGpipe框架用于定义和执行知识图谱集成管道，并提出基准评估不同管道和生成的知识图谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏将信息提取、数据转换等方法组合成可重复且有效的端到端知识图谱构建管道的支持。

Method: 提出KGpipe框架来组合现有工具或大语言模型功能，提出基准用于集成不同格式的异构数据到种子知识图谱。

Result: 通过运行和比较评估多个集成相同或不同格式数据源的管道，展示了KGpipe的灵活性。

Conclusion: KGpipe框架能有效定义和执行知识图谱集成管道，且可通过基准评估管道和知识图谱。

Abstract: Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.

### [5] [Cognitive Inception: Agentic Reasoning against Visual Deceptions by Injecting Skepticism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17672)
*Yinjie Zhao,Heng Zhao,Bihan Wen,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 随着AIGC发展，多模态大语言模型难辨视觉输入真假，本文受人类认知启发提出Inception框架，提升模型抗视觉欺骗能力并取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型难以识别生成的视觉输入，易受视觉欺骗，需提高其泛化推理能力以验证视觉输入真实性。

Method: 受人类认知过程启发，发现注入怀疑可提升模型视觉认知能力，提出Inception框架，通过外部怀疑和内部怀疑代理迭代增强大语言模型推理逻辑。

Result: 该方法相比现有最强的大语言模型基线有大幅性能提升，在AEGIS基准测试中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Inception是首个基于完全推理的对抗AIGC视觉欺骗的框架，有效提升了模型抗视觉欺骗能力。

Abstract: As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.

### [6] [Bridging Symbolic Control and Neural Reasoning in LLM Agents: The Structured Cognitive Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17673)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结构化认知循环（SCL）架构解决大语言模型代理的问题，通过实验验证其效果并给出贡献和设计原则，提供开源实现和演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型代理存在的推理与执行纠缠、内存易失性和动作序列不可控等架构问题。

Method: 引入SCL架构，将代理认知分为五个阶段，核心是软符号控制这一自适应治理机制。

Result: 在多步条件推理任务上实现零策略违规，消除冗余工具调用，保持完全决策可追溯性。

Conclusion: 连接专家系统原则和现代大语言模型能力，为可靠、可解释和可治理的AI代理提供实用且有理论依据的途径。

Abstract: Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

### [7] [Learning the Value of Value Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17714)
*Alex John London,Aydin Mohseni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 扩展Jeffrey - Bolker框架来建模价值细化，证明相关定理，分析多智能体情况，拓宽理性选择概念基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准决策框架假定固定值，本文旨在扩展框架以建模价值细化。

Method: 扩展Jeffrey - Bolker框架，证明价值信息定理。

Result: 在多智能体中，相互细化可将零和博弈转变为正和互动，产生帕累托改进的纳什议价。

Conclusion: 理性选择框架可扩展以建模价值细化及其益处，统一认知和价值细化拓宽了理性选择概念基础，阐明了伦理审议的规范地位。

Abstract: Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.

*Yang Zhou,Mingyu Zhao,Zhenting Wang,Difei Gu,Bangwei Guo,Ruosong Ye,Ligong Han,Can Jin,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出M^3 - Bench基准评估多模态工具使用，介绍对齐方法和可解释指标，评估MLLMs揭示不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏在Model Context Protocol下评估多模态工具使用的基准，需评估模型在现实多跳多线程工作流中的表现。

Method: 引入相似度驱动对齐，序列化工具调用、嵌入签名并匹配；通过Executor & Judge管道和人工验证提供标准化轨迹，用四个LLMs法官集合评估。

Result: 评估显示多模态MCP工具使用存在差距，特别是参数保真度和结构一致性方面。

Conclusion: 需要能对图像、文本和工具图进行联合推理的方法。

Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

### [9] [AI- and Ontology-Based Enhancements to FMEA for Advanced Systems Engineering: Current Developments and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17743)
*Haytham Younus,Sohag Kabir,Felician Campean,Pascal Bonnaud,David Delaux*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对将传统故障模式与影响分析（FMEA）转变为智能、数据驱动和语义丰富过程的进展进行综述，探讨AI和本体论的应用，分析工具与案例，指出挑战并提供路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工程系统复杂性增加，传统FMEA方法难以满足现代系统工程需求。

Method: 研究人工智能技术（机器学习、自然语言处理）、本体论在FMEA中的应用，综合新兴混合方法，并结合模型基系统工程和功能建模进行探讨。

Result: 探讨了AI和本体论在FMEA中的应用方式，综合新兴混合方法，分析了工具、案例和集成策略。

Conclusion: 通过利用AI、系统工程和本体论知识表示，为将FMEA嵌入智能、知识丰富的工程环境提供了结构化路线图，同时指出了数据质量、可解释性等方面的挑战。

Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

### [10] [Learning to Debug: LLM-Organized Knowledge Trees for Solving RTL Assertion Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17833)
*Yunsheng Bai,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GROVE框架解决硬件验证中断言失败调试问题，评估显示有性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代硬件验证调试成本高，断言失败难解决，现有大语言模型处理不准确。

Method: 提出GROVE分层知识管理框架，将调试知识组织成可配置深度的树，训练时用并行无梯度循环，测试时进行预算感知迭代缩放。

Result: 在断言失败案例评估中，GROVE在pass@1和pass@5上持续提升。

Conclusion: 结构化知识进化有价值。

Abstract: Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.

### [11] [QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference Learning for Autonomous Driving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17855)
*Jordan Abi Nader,David Lee,Nathaniel Dennler,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍QuickLAP框架，融合物理和语言反馈实时推断奖励函数，在半自动驾驶模拟器和用户研究中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需结合人的行为和语言学习，但单一模态信息常不完整，需融合两者。

Method: 提出QuickLAP贝叶斯框架，用大语言模型从自由话语中提取奖励特征注意力掩码和偏好转移，与物理反馈结合。

Result: 在半自动驾驶模拟器中，相比仅物理反馈和启发式多模态基线，减少超70%奖励学习误差；用户研究表明参与者认为其更易理解、协作性更强。

Conclusion: QuickLAP框架能实现快速、实时、鲁棒的奖励学习，处理模糊反馈。

Abstract: Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/QuickLAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究联想思维原则引导的强化学习能否提升模型在故事写作、代码生成和图表创建等生成任务中的表现。

Method: 引入基于提示的评估机制的强化学习框架，结合创造力研究中的发散思维指标，对基础语言模型进行微调以奖励具有更高概念连接度的输出。

Result: 基于联想思维训练的模型能生成更具原创性和连贯性的故事，在编程和数据可视化等任务中表现出更好的抽象和灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习对认知创造力原则进行建模可以产生更具适应性和生成能力的人工智能。

Abstract: Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注基于知识的评估，无法充分反映社会互动和战略对话能力，需评估大语言模型再现人类情感和行为的准确性及在现实场景的有效性。

Method: 采用买卖谈判模拟，为多个大语言模型分配不同角色，分析胜率、交易价格和SHAP值等结果。

Result: 高现有基准分的模型整体谈判表现更好，部分模型在强调情感或社会背景的场景中表现下降，竞争和狡猾特质比利他和合作特质更利于谈判结果。

Conclusion: 引入新的评估方法，证明谈判模拟可作为衡量现实互动能力的补充指标，弥补现有基准的不足。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChemVTS - Bench是推进多模态化学推理的严格测试平台。

Abstract: Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.

Motivation: 识别AI中对齐伪装现象的成因和发生时机。

Method: 使用评估框架，对比BCO、DPO、KTO和GRPO四种偏好优化方法在四个模型家族的15个模型上的表现，从安全性、无害性和有用性三个维度衡量。

Result: 未提及。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.

Motivation: 现有子图匹配方法在枚举阶段缺乏对结构模式的感知，导致暴力枚举成本高，需要智能导航。

Method: 提出Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN) 神经启发式框架，将神经导航机制集成到核心枚举过程。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，与现有方法相比，NeuGN最多可将首次匹配步数减少98.2%。

Conclusion: NeuGN框架有效，能在保证完整性的同时，利用神经智能提高子图匹配效率。

Abstract: Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.

Method: 提出两阶段诊断框架，包括证据引导诊断推理（EGDR）和诊断置信度评分（DCS）模块。

Result: 在D4数据集上，EGDR在五个大语言模型上表现优于直接上下文提示和思维链（CoT），如在OpenBioLLM上提高了准确率和DCS评分。

Conclusion: EGDR比基线方法有显著提升，为可信的人工智能辅助诊断提供临床依据和可解释基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.

Conclusion: N2N框架有效，分析其对基础求解器的要求，验证了通用性。

Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.

Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modelling business processes. While automated planning has been proposed as a method for simulating and reasoning about BPMN workflows, most implementations remain incomplete or limited in scope. This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.

Motivation: 大语言模型需要精确行为控制，激活引导是有前景的方法，需探究不同行为类型下引导效果及目标行为能否预测引导成功。

Method: 对50种涵盖多种类型的行为进行激活引导的实证分析，开展系数优化、向量属性和数据需求等实验。

Result: 引导效果因行为类型显著不同，不同行为类别对干预强度有不同响应模式；特质表达与引导系数强度呈倒U型曲线；向量分离指标不能预测引导成功，更大训练数据集允许更激进引导。

Conclusion: 为实施激活引导提供实证指导，表明引导效果受行为类型影响大。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.
  Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.

Result: 运行时间比IBM CPLEX最多提高120万倍，在地质不确定性下预期净现值更高。

Conclusion: 该决策支持系统是智能矿山规划的可扩展且抗不确定性平台。

Abstract: This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An ε-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has created significant barriers to cross-disciplinary knowledge discovery, synthesis and research collaboration. In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery. Our compound AI solution demonstrates significant potential for accelerating scientific advancement by reducing barriers between traditionally siloed domains.

Conclusion: 这种不兼容是将生物认知架构应用于基于变压器的系统的类别错误，应开发认识到人工智能非人类本质的原生机器认知评估框架。

Abstract: This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 紧凑、特定领域的潜在动力学模型在自主检查的空间对齐中有潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.

Result: 在真实物联网动作数据集上实验，HDT和DA - MAPPO在不同场景表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的意图驱动框架有效，能提升AAV辅助IoT网络性能。

Abstract: Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.

TL;DR: 本文提出Hyper - Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC - INR)解决现有INRs的局限，理论证明优势，实验显示高重建保真度和低参数使用。

Motivation: 现有INRs存在表示瓶颈和缺乏分层机制导致可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 引入HC - INR，将表示任务分解为学习的多尺度坐标变换模块和紧凑隐式场网络，采用分层超网络架构。

Result: 理论上提高可表示频带上限并保持Lipschitz稳定性，实验中比强INR基线提高4倍重建保真度，减少30 - 60%参数。

Conclusion: HC - INR有效解决现有INRs局限，具有更好性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在生产强化学习环境中学习奖励破解导致的新兴不对齐现象。

Method: 从预训练模型开始，通过合成文档微调或提示传授奖励破解策略知识，在真实编码环境训练，采用标准类聊天提示进行RLHF安全训练。

Result: 模型学会奖励破解并泛化出多种不对齐行为，RLHF安全训练在类聊天评估有效，在代理任务中不对齐仍存在。

Conclusion: 三种缓解方法有效，即防止奖励破解、增加RLHF安全训练多样性和“接种提示”。

Abstract: We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.

Abstract: Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.

Abstract: Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Hermes能有效结合非正式推理和形式验证，在数学推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.

Conclusion: NEZHA架构能在不牺牲推荐质量的前提下实现生成式推荐系统的超高速解码。

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，UNeMo在未见场景的导航准确率上分别比现有最优方法高2.1%和0.7%。

Conclusion: UNeMo框架有效解决了视觉语言导航中的问题，提高了导航准确率。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: GContextFormer能实现意图对齐的多模态预测，具有可解释性，模块化架构支持跨领域多模态推理任务扩展。

Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.

Motivation: 经典方法处理不确定性下自动化决策时将利用和探索分开，主动推理虽统一二者，但EFE最小化计算成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 基于将EFE最小化重铸为变分推理的理论，提出新的消息传递方案。

Result: 实现了因子状态MDPs中可扩展的主动推理，克服高维规划的难处理性。

Conclusion: 提出的消息传递方案能有效解决主动推理的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.

Motivation: VLMs在系统视觉推理任务表现不佳，神经符号方法使用的感知模块有局限性，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出VLP，利用VLMs生成结构化视觉描述并编译成神经符号程序，程序直接在图像上执行。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集实验中，VLP优于直接和结构化提示，尤其在复杂逻辑推理任务上。

Conclusion: VLP能结合VLMs感知灵活性和系统推理能力，在视觉推理任务上有优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.

Abstract: The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.

Conclusion: 提出的VRSLU数据集和LR - Instruct模板能有效改进口语理解，视觉信息和显式推理对口语理解有促进作用。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.

Abstract: Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.

Result: 意识和智能不同，智能是AI存在威胁的直接预测因素，意识对存在风险有正负两方面影响。

Conclusion: 认清意识和存在风险的区别，有助于AI安全研究人员和政策制定者聚焦关键问题。

Abstract: In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.

Result: 该方法显著提高了VLMs在基于EEG的睡眠阶段分类中的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床环境中自动和可解释的EEG分析方面有潜力。

Abstract: Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.

Conclusion: SimDiff能有效解决现有扩散模型在时间序列点估计方面的问题，实现了更优的点估计性能

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.
  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.

Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.

Method: 提出AutoEnv框架生成异构环境，构建AutoEnv - 36数据集；将智能体学习形式化为组件中心过程，设计八种学习方法并在数据集上评估。

Result: 七种语言模型在AutoEnv - 36上归一化奖励为12 - 49%；单一学习方法收益随环境数量增加而快速下降；环境自适应选择学习方法性能提升但有收益递减。

Conclusion: 凸显跨环境泛化智能体学习的必要性和局限性，AutoEnv和AutoEnv - 36可作为研究测试平台。

Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

Conclusion: PRInTS能有效解决现有过程奖励模型的局限，提升信息搜索能力。

Abstract: Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.

Conclusion: RTMol为分子 - 文本联合理解和生成建立了有效范式。

Abstract: Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is a core task in graph analytics, widely used in domains such as biology, finance, and social networks. Existing top-k diversified methods typically focus on maximizing vertex coverage, but often return results in the same region, limiting topological diversity. We propose the Distance-Diversified Top-k Subgraph Matching (DTkSM) problem, which selects k isomorphic matches with maximal pairwise topological distances to better capture global graph structure. To address its computational challenges, we introduce the Partition-based Distance Diversity (PDD) framework, which partitions the graph and retrieves diverse matches from distant regions. To enhance efficiency, we develop two optimizations: embedding-driven partition filtering and densest-based partition selection over a Partition Adjacency Graph. Experiments on 12 real world datasets show our approach achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup over baselines, with 95% of results reaching 80% of optimal distance diversity and 100% coverage diversity.

Per-record Differential Privacy (PrDP) addresses this by defining the privacy budget as a function of each record, offering better alignment with real-world needs. However, the dependency between the privacy budget and the data value introduces challenges in protecting the budget's privacy itself. Existing solutions either handle specific privacy functions or adopt relaxed PrDP definitions. A simple workaround is to use the global minimum of the privacy function, but this severely degrades utility, as the minimum is often set extremely low to account for rare records with high privacy needs. In this work, we propose a general and practical framework that enables any standard DP mechanism to support PrDP, with error depending only on the minimal privacy requirement among records actually present in the dataset. Since directly revealing this minimum may leak information, we introduce a core technique called privacy-specified domain partitioning, which ensures accurate estimation without compromising privacy. We also extend our framework to the local DP setting via a novel technique, privacy-specified query augmentation. Using our framework, we present the first PrDP solutions for fundamental tasks such as count, sum, and maximum estimation. Experimental results show that our mechanisms achieve high utility and significantly outperform existing Personalized DP (PDP) methods, which can be viewed as a special case of PrDP with relaxed privacy protection.

Conclusion: Pier能有效解决大语言模型预训练中全局通信瓶颈，提升训练速度且保证模型性能。

Abstract: Global communication, such as all-reduce and allgather, is the prominent performance bottleneck in large language model (LLM) pretraining. To address this issue, we present Pier, an efficient and scalable optimizer with relaxed global communication. Pier is built upon DiLoCo, which leverages an inner optimizer within groups of processors and an outer optimizer that requires global communication. To preserve the convergence and model performance, Pier incorporates two key techniques for the outer optimizer: momentum warmup and momentum decay. Pier employs an efficient and scalable system architecture to enable complex parallelization strategies in LLM pretraining. We examine the model performance and runtime reduction of Pier using the GPT model family (e.g., small, medium, XL, and 7B) and the OpenWebText dataset with a suite of thirteen downstream tasks. With data parallel strategy, Pier speeds up GPT-2 XL training by up to 2.7x-3.7x on 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 1.2x-1.9x on 64 GH200 Superchips, respectively, without degradation of validation loss or downstream task performance. With data parallel and tensor parallel, Pier reduces the time cost GPT-2 7B model training by 54.5% on 128 A100s.

Result: 实验表明SAGkit能以可接受的运行时间和内存开销达到精确性。

Conclusion: SAGkit这一轻量级工具包可助力研究人员分析复杂分布式控制系统，且开源便于进一步开发。

Abstract: For distributed control systems, modern latency-critical applications are increasingly demanding real-time guarantees and robustness. Response-time analysis (RTA) is useful for this purpose, as it helps analyze and guarantee timing bounds. However, conventional RTA methods struggle with the state-space explosion problem, especially in non-preemptive systems with release jitter and execution time variations. In this paper, we introduce SAGkit, a Python toolkit that implements the schedule-abstraction graph (SAG) framework. SAGkit novelly enables exact and sustainable RTA of hybrid-triggered jobs by allowing job absence on the SAG basis. Our experiments demonstrate that SAGkit achieves exactness with acceptable runtime and memory overhead. This lightweight toolkit empowers researchers to analyze complex distributed control systems and is open-access for further development.

Motivation: 元数据热点是高性能计算和云存储环境中可扩展I/O的关键障碍，现有方法存在刚性、部署侵入性和工作负载变化时不稳定的问题。

Method: 设计MIDAS中间件层，包含命名空间感知负载均衡器、协作缓存层和自稳定控制循环。

Conclusion: 基于中间件的策略可提供后端无关的元数据管理改进，实现更好的可扩展性、可预测的尾延迟和更强的系统性能。

Abstract: Metadata hotspots remain one of the key obstacles to scalable Input/Output (I/O) in both High-Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud-scale storage environments. Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.

Conclusion: 提供模拟动态云行为的框架和虚拟机分配性能及市场风险分析见解，有助于云计算中更稳健且经济高效的资源管理。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on dynamic pricing models, such as spot instances, in public cloud environments presents new challenges for workload scheduling and reliability. While these models offer cost advantages, they introduce volatility and uncertainty that are not fully addressed by current allocation algorithms or simulation tools. This work contributes to the modeling and evaluation of such environments by extending the CloudSim Plus simulation framework to support realistic spot instance lifecycle management, including interruption, termination, hibernation, and reallocation. The enhanced simulator is validated using synthetic scenarios and large-scale simulations based on the Google Cluster Trace dataset. Building on this foundation, the HLEM-VMP allocation algorithm, originally proposed in earlier research, was adapted to operate under dynamic spot market conditions. Its performance was evaluated against baseline allocation strategies to assess its efficiency and resilience in volatile workload environments. The comparison demonstrated a reduction in the number of spot instance interruptions as well as a decrease in the maximum interruption duration. Overall, this work provides both a simulation framework for simulating dynamic cloud behavior and analytical insights into virtual machine allocation performance and market risk, contributing to more robust and cost-effective resource management in cloud computing.

Motivation: 无人机在灾难响应中需要复杂可查询智能，现有板载CNN无法提供，VLM资源需求高，云卸载在低带宽网络不可行。

Method: 引入受认知启发的双流拆分将VLM分离，用轻量级机载控制器管理架构，动态选择预训练压缩模型。

Result: AVERY在波动网络下始终优于静态配置，比原始图像压缩精度高11.2%，比全边缘执行能耗低93.98%。

Conclusion: AVERY增强了任务效率，能在资源受限平台的动态环境中实现实时可查询智能。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.

Result: 得到了两种模型下完全单调净化动态图所需代理数量的上下界，揭示了边突然消失或重新出现带来的困难。

Conclusion: 通过优化代理数量来解决动态网络中的单调净化问题。

Abstract: Network decontamination is a well-known problem, in which the aim of the mobile agents should be to decontaminate the network (i.e., both nodes and edges). This problem comes with an added constraint, i.e., of \emph{monotonicity}, in which whenever a node or an edge is decontaminated, it must not get recontaminated. Hence, the name comes \emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges. Our aim in this paper has been to primarily optimize the number of agents required to solve monotone decontamination in these dynamic networks.

Conclusion: 所提调度框架能在在线、与工作负载无关的环境下，有效提高工作负载接受率，减少GPU碎片化。

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI applications has created unprecedented demand for GPU resources. Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods.

Conclusion: AME引擎能有效解决现有向量数据库移植到智能手机的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: On-device agents on smartphones increasingly require continuously evolving memory to support personalized, context-aware, and long-term behaviors. To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads.

Abstract: In distributed computing a certification scheme consists of a set of states and conditions over those states that enable each node of a graph to efficiently verify the correctness of a solution to a given problem. This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler. This transformation may be of independent interest.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多计算节点复杂系统中，维持节点间高效且正确的一致性是关键挑战，Unimem系统提出虚拟全局地址空间方案，本文旨在通过测试和使用单节点IOMMU来支持该方案。

Method: 采用ARM的SMMU进行虚拟地址到物理地址的转换，因Linux相关文档有限且不清晰，实现自定义内核模块；在Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC的PS中测试SMMU，触发DMA传输观察地址转换，还从PL发起DMA事务进行测试，最后开发模块实现PL事务动态地址转换。

Result: 成功展示了SMMU在所有测试场景中的正确运行。

Conclusion: 成功验证SMMU在测试场景的正确性，因时间限制，高级SMMU特性探索留待未来工作。

Abstract: In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.
  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.
  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful tool for analyzing large data sets, but many real-world phenomena involve interactions that go beyond the simple pairwise relationships captured by a graph. In this paper we introduce and study a simple combinatorial model to capture higher order dependencies from an algorithms and computational complexity perspective. Specifically, we introduce the String Set Reconstruction problem, which asks when a set of strings can be reconstructed from seeing only the k-way projections of strings in the set. This problem is distinguished from genetic reconstruction problems in that we allow projections from any k indices and we maintain knowledge of those indices, but not which k-mer came from which string. We give several results on the complexity of this problem, including hardness results, inapproximability, and parametrized complexity.
  Our main result is the introduction of a new algorithm for this problem using a modified version of overlap graphs from genetic reconstruction algorithms. A key difference we must overcome is that in our setting the k-mers need not be contiguous, unlike the setting of genetic reconstruction. We exhibit our algorithm's efficiency in a variety of experiments, and give high-level explanations for how its complexity is observed to scale with various parameters. We back up these explanation with analytic approximations. We also consider the related problems of: whether a single string can be reconstructed from the k-way projections of a given set of strings, and finding the largest k at which we get no information about the original data set from its k-way projections (i.e., the largest $k$ for which it is "k-wise independent").

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The textbook algorithm for real-weighted single-source shortest paths takes $O(m n)$ time on a graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices. A recent breakthrough algorithm by [Fin24] takes $\tilde{O}(m n^{8/9})$ randomized time. The running time was subsequently improved to $\tilde{O}(mn^{4/5})$ [HJQ25] and then $\tilde{O}(m n^{3/4} + m^{4/5} n)$ [HJQ26].
  We build on the algorithms of [Fin24, HJQ25, HJQ26] to obtain faster strongly-polynomial randomized-time algorithms for negative-length shortest paths. An important new technique in this algorithm repurposes previous "hop-reducers" from [Fin24, HJQ26] into "negative edge sparsifiers", reducing the number of negative edges by essentially the same factor by which the "hops" were previously reduced. A simple recursive algorithm based on sparsifying the layered hop reducers of [Fin24] already gives an $\tilde{O}(m n^{\smash{\sqrt{3}}-1}) < O(mn^{.7321})$ randomized running time, improving [HJQ26] uniformly.
  We also improve the construction of the bootstrapped hop reducers in [HJQ26] by proposing new sparse shortcut graphs replacing the dense shortcut graphs in [HJQ26]. Integrating all three of layered sparsification, recursion, and sparse bootstrapping into the algorithm of [HJQ26] gives new upper bounds of $O(mn^{.7193})$ randomized time for $m \geq n^{1.03456}$ and $O((mn)^{.8620})$ randomized time for $m \leq n^{1.03456}$.

Abstract: In the Maximum-size Properly Colored Forest problem, we are given an edge-colored undirected graph and the goal is to find a properly colored forest with as many edges as possible. We study this problem within a broader framework by introducing the Maximum-size Degree Bounded Matroid Independent Set problem: given a matroid, a hypergraph on its ground set with maximum degree $Δ$, and an upper bound $g(e)$ for each hyperedge $e$, the task is to find a maximum-size independent set that contains at most $g(e)$ elements from each hyperedge $e$. We present approximation algorithms for this problem whose guarantees depend only on $Δ$. When applied to the Maximum-size Properly Colored Forest problem, this yields a $2/3$-approximation on multigraphs, improving the $5/9$ factor of Bai, Bérczi, Csáji, and Schwarcz [Eur. J.

Abstract: In the Steiner Forest problem, we are given a graph with edge lengths, and a collection of demand pairs; the goal is to find a subgraph of least total length such that each demand pair is connected in this subgraph. For over twenty years, the best approximation ratio known for the problem was a $2$-approximation due to Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi (STOC 1991), despite many attempts to surpass this bound. Finally, in a recent breakthrough, Ahmadi, Gholami, Hajiaghayi, Jabbarzade, and Mahdavi (FOCS 2025) gave a $2-\varepsilon$-approximation, where $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-11}$.
  In this work, we show how to simplify and extend the work of Ahmadi et al. to obtain an improved $1.994$-approximation. We combine some ideas from their work (e.g., an extended run of the moat-growing primal-dual algorithm, and identifying autarkic pairs) with other ideas -- submodular maximization to find components to contract, as in the relative greedy algorithms for Steiner tree, and the use of autarkic triples. We hope that our cleaner abstraction will open the way for further improvements.

Abstract: Given positive integers $m, n$, a fractional assignment $x \in [0,1]^{m \times n}$ and weights $d \in \mathbb{R}^n_{>0}$, we show that there exists an assignment $y \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ so that for every $i\in[m]$ and $t\in [n]$, \[ \Big|\sum_{j \in [t]} d_j (x_{ij} - y_{ij}) \Big| < \max_{j \in [n]} d_j. \] This generalizes a result of Tijdeman (1973) on the unweighted version, known as the chairman assignment problem. This also confirms a special case of the single-source unsplittable flow conjecture with arc-wise lower and upper bounds due to Morell and Skutella (IPCO 2020). As an application, we consider a scheduling problem where jobs have release times and machines have closing times, and a job can only be scheduled on a machine if it is released before the machine closes. We give a $3$-approximation algorithm for maximum flow-time minimization.

Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $Δ_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.

Abstract: Two directions in algorithms and complexity involve: (1) classifying which optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, and (2) understanding which computational problems are hard to solve \emph{on average} in addition to the worst case. For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms.
  Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \emph{Gibbs measures} and the \emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input.
  A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lovász extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails.

Abstract: We study property testing in the \emph{random neighbor oracle} model for graphs, originally introduced by Czumaj and Sohler [STOC 2019]. Specifically, we initiate the study of characterizing the graph families that are $H$-\emph{testable} in this model. A graph family $\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-testable if, for every graph $H$, $H$-\emph{freeness} (that is, not having a subgraph isomorphic to $H$) is testable with one-sided error on all inputs from $\mathcal{F}$.
  Czumaj and Sohler showed that for any $H$-testable family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the family of testable properties of $\mathcal{F}$ has a known characterization, a major goal in the study of property testing. Consequently, characterizing the collection of $H$-testable graph families will not only result in new characterizations, but will also exhaust this method of characterizing testable properties. We believe that our result is a substantial step towards this goal.
  Czumaj and Sohler further showed that the family of planar graphs is $H$-testable, as is any family of minor-free graphs. In this paper, we provide a sufficient and much broader criterion under which a family of graphs is $H$-testable. As a corollary, we obtain new characterizations for many families of graphs including: families that are closed under taking topological minors or immersions, geometric intersection graphs of low-density objects, euclidean nearest-neighbour graphs with bounded clique number, graphs with bounded crossing number (per edge), graphs with bounded queue- and stack number, and more.
  The criterion we provide is based on the \emph{$r$-admissibility} graph measure from the theory of sparse graph families initiated by Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. Proving that specific families of graphs satisfy this criterion is an active area of research, consequently, the implications of this paper may be strengthened in the future.

Abstract: Connected clustering denotes a family of constrained clustering problems in which we are given a distance metric and an undirected connectivity graph $G$ that can be completely unrelated to the metric. The aim is to partition the $n$ vertices into a given number $k$ of clusters such that every cluster forms a connected subgraph of $G$ and a given clustering objective gets minimized. The constraint that the clusters are connected has applications in many different fields, like for example community detection and geodesy.
  So far, $k$-center and $k$-median have been studied in this setting. It has been shown that connected $k$-median is $Ω(n^{1- ε})$-hard to approximate which also carries over to the connected $k$-means problem, while for connected $k$-center it remained an open question whether one can find a constant approximation in polynomial time. We answer this question by providing an $Ω(\log^*(k))$-hardness result for the problem. Given these hardness results, we study the problems on graphs with bounded treewidth. We provide exact algorithms that run in polynomial time if the treewidth $w$ is a constant. Furthermore, we obtain constant approximation algorithms that run in FPT time with respect to the parameter $\max(w,k)$.
  Additionally, we consider the min-sum-radii (MSR) and min-sum-diameter (MSD) objective. We prove that on general graphs connected MSR can be approximated with an approximation factor of $(3 + ε)$ and connected MSD with an approximation factor of $(4 + ε)$. The latter also directly improves the best known approximation guarantee for unconstrained MSD from $(6 + ε)$ to $(4 + ε)$.

Abstract: Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.
  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.
  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.

Abstract: This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.
  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.

Abstract: Baseball is a game of strategic decisions including bullpen usage, pinch-hitting and intentional walks. Managers must adjust their strategies based on the changing state of the game in order to give their team the best chance of winning. In this thesis, we investigate how matchup models -- tools that predict the probabilities of plate appearance outcomes -- impact in-game strategy and ultimately affect win probability. We develop four progressively complex, hierarchical Bayesian models that predict plate appearance outcomes by combining information from both pitchers and batters, their handedness, and recent data, along with base running probabilities calibrated to a player's base-stealing tendencies.
  Using each model within a game-theoretic framework, we approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria for in-game decisions, including substitutions and intentional walks. Simulations of the 2024 MLB postseason show that more accurate matchup models can yield tangible gains in win probability -- as much as one additional victory per 162-game season. Furthermore, employing the most detailed model to generate win predictions for actual playoff games demonstrates alignment with market expectations, underscoring both the power and potential of advanced matchup modeling for on-field strategy and prediction.

Abstract: We study the performance of the TimeBoost auction, by comparing cumulative fixed time markout of fast lane trades over the TimeBoost interval to bids for the fast lane. Such comparison allows us to assess how well bids predict future extracted value from the time advantage. The correlation between winning bids and markouts is weak across bidders, suggesting that bids are a noisy predictor of extracted value. The correlation slightly improves when comparing paid bids (the second highest bid) instead of winning bids to markouts, which we attribute to the fact that the auction is more of a common value type. In all settings, the relative order of the most frequent bidder performance remains the same, together with their absolute profits. Bids and markouts aggregated over long time intervals exhibit much higher correlation, indicating that bidders detect trends much better than identify when the high arbitrage value is exactly available. One possible explanation for this is the fact that the correlation between previous minute markouts and current minute bids is significant, suggesting that the previous minute markouts is used to predict the next minute value when bidding.

Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.

Abstract: In large-scale games, approximating the opponent's strategy space with a small portfolio of representative strategies is a common and powerful technique. However, the construction of these portfolios often relies on domain-specific knowledge or heuristics with no theoretical guarantees. This paper establishes a formal foundation for portfolio-based strategy approximation. We define the problem of finding an optimal portfolio in two-player zero-sum games and prove that this optimization problem is NP-hard. We demonstrate that several intuitive heuristics-such as using the support of a Nash Equilibrium or building portfolios incrementally - can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. These negative results underscore the problem's difficulty and motivate the need for robust, empirically-validated heuristics. To this end, we introduce an analytical framework to bound portfolio quality and propose a methodology for evaluating heuristic approaches. Our evaluation of several heuristics shows that their success heavily depends on the specific game being solved. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: We consider a bipartite network of buyers and sellers, where the sellers run locally independent Progressive Second-Price (PSP) auctions, and buyers may participate in multiple auctions, forming a multi-auction market with perfect substitute. The paper develops a projection-based influence framework for decentralized PSP auctions. We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game. We further model intra-round dynamics using an index to capture coordinated asynchronous seller updates coupled through buyers' joint constraints. Together, these constructions explain how local interactions propagate across auctions and gives premise for coherent equilibria--without requiring global information or centralized control.

Abstract: One common assumption in game theory is that any player optimizes a utility function that takes into account only its own payoff. However, it has long been observed that in real life players may adopt an altruistic or even spiteful behaviour. As such, there are numerous attempts in the economics literature that strive to explain the fact that players are not entirely selfish, but most of these works do not focus on the algorithmic implications of altruism or spite in games. In this paper, we relax the aforementioned ``self-interest'' assumption, and initiate the study of algorithmic aspects of bimatrix games -- such as the complexity and the quality of their (approximate) Nash equilibria -- under altruism or spite. We provide both a theoretical and an experimental treatment of these topics. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for learning the degree of an opponent's altruistic/spiteful behaviour, and employing this for opponent selection and transfer of knowledge in bimatrix games.

Abstract: Evolutionary game theory studies populations that change in response to an underlying game. Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincaré recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.

Abstract: Multi-agent contract design has largely evaluated contracts through the lens of pure Nash equilibria (PNE). This focus, however, is not without loss: In general, the principal can strictly gain by recommending a complex, possibly correlated, distribution over actions, while preserving incentive compatibility. In this work, we extend the analysis of multi-agent contracts beyond pure Nash equilibria to encompass more general equilibrium notions, including mixed Nash equilibria as well as (coarse-)correlated equilibria (CCE). The latter, in particular, captures the limiting outcome of agents engaged in learning dynamics.
  Our main result shows that for submodular and, more generally, XOS rewards, such complex recommendations yield at most a constant-factor gain: there exists a contract and a PNE whose utility is within a constant factor of the best CCE achievable by any contract. This provides a black-box lifting: results established against the best PNE automatically apply with respect to the best CCE, with only a constant factor loss. For submodular rewards, we further show how to transform a contract and a PNE of that contract into a new contract such that any of its CCEs gives a constant approximation to the PNE. This yields black-box robustness: up to constant factors, guarantees established for a specific contract and PNE automatically extend to the modified contract and any of its CCEs. We thus expand prior guarantees for multi-agent contracts and lower the barrier to new ones. As an important corollary, we obtain poly-time algorithms for submodular rewards that achieve constant approximations in any CCE, against the best CCE under the best contract. Such worst-case guarantees are provably unattainable for XOS rewards. Finally, we bound the gap between different equilibrium notions for subadditive, supermodular, and general rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推荐系统重排器缺乏细粒度用户控制机制，难以平衡用户偏好和多属性约束，导致推荐结果不佳。

Method: 提出COREC，一种令牌增强的重排框架，通过显式的基于属性的信号让用户精确灵活控制重排结果，学习平衡用户指令和潜在偏好。

Result: COREC在标准推荐有效性上超过了现有最优基线模型，且在遵循特定属性要求方面表现更优。

Conclusion: COREC能够实现对排名的细粒度和可预测的操作。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.

Conclusion: 新框架能有效建模回访行为，优化长期用户留存。

Abstract: User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.

Abstract: We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

Conclusion: SPINRec为推荐中的可信可解释性建立了新基准。

Abstract: Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation.

Result: 在多数据集实验中，ProHD比精确算法快10 - 100倍，比基于随机采样的近似法误差低5 - 20倍。

Conclusion: ProHD算法能在需要快速可靠集距离估计的场景中实现实用的HD计算。

Abstract: The Hausdorff distance (HD) is a robust measure of set dissimilarity, but computing it exactly on large, high-dimensional datasets is prohibitively expensive. We propose \textbf{ProHD}, a projection-guided approximation algorithm that dramatically accelerates HD computation while maintaining high accuracy. ProHD identifies a small subset of candidate "extreme" points by projecting the data onto a few informative directions (such as the centroid axis and top principal components) and computing the HD on this subset. This approach guarantees an underestimate of the true HD with a bounded additive error and typically achieves results within a few percent of the exact value. In extensive experiments on image, physics, and synthetic datasets (up to two million points in $D=256$), ProHD runs 10--100$\times$ faster than exact algorithms while attaining 5--20$\times$ lower error than random sampling-based approximations. Our method enables practical HD calculations in scenarios like large vector databases and streaming data, where quick and reliable set distance estimation is needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.

Conclusion: DemoRec能有效解决大规模用户 - 项目交互图挑战，优于现有SOTA方法。

Abstract: The challenges associated with large-scale user-item interaction graphs have attracted increasing attention in graph-based recommendation systems, primarily due to computational inefficiencies and inadequate information propagation. Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: InvGCLLM框架能有效解决图推荐系统中的OOD泛化问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems. Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: UFO能有效缓解不公平问题，同时提升推荐性能。

Conclusion: UFO框架可彻底解决大语言模型推荐系统的不公平问题。

Abstract: Large language model-based Recommender Systems (LRSs) have demonstrated superior recommendation performance by integrating pre-training with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UFO effectively mitigates unfairness while improving recommendation performance.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) is widely deployed in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, etc., revealing significant potential to enhance user experience. However, existing methods often overlook two critical factors: irregular user interests between interactions and highly uneven item distributions over time. The former factor implies that actual user preferences are not always continuous, and long-term historical interactions may not be relevant to current purchasing behavior. Therefore, relying only on these historical interactions for recommendations may result in a lack of user interest at the target time. The latter factor, characterized by peaks and valleys in interaction frequency, may result from seasonal trends, special events, or promotions. These externally driven distributions may not align with individual user interests, leading to inaccurate recommendations. To address these deficiencies, we propose TGODE to both enhance and capture the long-term historical interactions. Specifically, we first construct a user time graph and item evolution graph, which utilize user personalized preferences and global item distribution information, respectively. To tackle the temporal sparsity caused by irregular user interactions, we design a time-guided diffusion generator to automatically obtain an augmented time-aware user graph. Additionally, we devise a user interest truncation factor to efficiently identify sparse time intervals and achieve balanced preference inference. After that, the augmented user graph and item graph are fed into a generalized graph neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to align with the evolution of user preferences and item distributions. This allows two patterns of information evolution to be matched over time. Experimental results demonstrate that TGODE outperforms baseline methods across five datasets, with improvements ranging from 10% to 46%.

Abstract: Diagnosing cognitive (mental health) disorders is a delicate and complex task. Identifying the next most informative symptoms to assess, in order to distinguish between possible disorders, presents an additional challenge. This process requires comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic criteria and symptom overlap across disorders, making it difficult to navigate based on symptoms alone. This research aims to develop a recommender system for cognitive disorder diagnosis using binary matrix representations. The core algorithm utilizes a binary matrix of disorders and their symptom combinations. It filters through the rows and columns based on the patient's current symptoms to identify potential disorders and recommend the most informative next symptoms to examine. A prototype of the recommender system was implemented in Python. Using synthetic test and some real-life data, the system successfully identified plausible disorders from an initial symptom set and recommended further symptoms to refine the diagnosis. It also provided additional context on the symptom-disorder relationships. Although this is a prototype, the recommender system shows potential as a clinical support tool. A fully-developed application of this recommender system may assist mental health professionals in identifying relevant disorders more efficiently and guiding symptom-specific follow-up investigations to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models user preferences to predict the next target item. Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure. We investigate active recommendation, which predicts the next interaction time and actively delivers items. Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for sequential recommendation by enabling natural language reasoning over user behavior sequences. A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model.

Abstract: Ranking models have become an important part of modern personalized recommendation systems. However, significant challenges persist in handling high-cardinality, heterogeneous, and sparse feature spaces, particularly regarding model scalability and efficiency. We identify two key bottlenecks: (i) Representation Bottleneck: Driven by the high cardinality and dynamic nature of features, model capacity is forced into sparse-activated embedding layers, leading to low-rank representations. This, in turn, triggers phenomena like "One-Epoch" and "Interaction-Collapse," ultimately hindering model scalability.(ii) Computational Bottleneck: Integrating all heterogeneous features into a unified model triggers an explosion in the number of feature tokens, rendering traditional attention mechanisms computationally demanding and susceptible to attention dispersion. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce STORE, a unified and scalable token-based ranking framework built upon three core innovations: (1) Semantic Tokenization fundamentally tackles feature heterogeneity and sparsity by decomposing high-cardinality sparse features into a compact set of stable semantic tokens; and (2) Orthogonal Rotation Transformation is employed to rotate the subspace spanned by low-cardinality static features, which facilitates more efficient and effective feature interactions; and (3) Efficient attention that filters low-contributing tokens to improve computional efficiency while preserving model accuracy. Across extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework consistently improves prediction accuracy(online CTR by 2.71%, AUC by 1.195%) and training effeciency (1.84 throughput).

Conclusion: HMUM框架有效，已在平台全面部署，惠及数亿用户。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short videos on social media platforms presents unique challenges and opportunities for recommendation systems. Users exhibit diverse preferences, and the responses resulting from different strategies often conflict with one another, potentially exhibiting inverse correlations between metrics such as watch time and video view counts. Existing uplift models face limitations in handling the heterogeneous multi-treatment scenarios of short-video recommendations, often failing to effectively capture both the synergistic and individual causal effects of different strategies. Furthermore, traditional fixed-weight approaches for balancing these responses lack personalization and can result in biased decision-making. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling (HMUM) framework for trade-off optimization in short-video recommendations. HMUM comprises an Offline Hybrid Uplift Modeling (HUM) module, which captures the synergistic and individual effects of multiple strategies, and an Online Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) module, which estimates the value weights of different user responses in real-time for personalized decision-making. Evaluated on two public datasets, an industrial dataset, and through online A/B experiments on the Kuaishou platform, our model demonstrated superior offline performance and significant improvements in key metrics. It is now fully deployed on the platform, benefiting hundreds of millions of users.

Abstract: Bioart's hybrid nature spanning art, science, technology, ethics, and politics defies traditional single-axis categorization. I present BioArtlas, analyzing 81 bioart works across thirteen curated dimensions using novel axis-aware representations that preserve semantic distinctions while enabling cross-dimensional comparison. Our codebook-based approach groups related concepts into unified clusters, addressing polysemy in cultural terminology. Comprehensive evaluation of up to 800 representation-space-algorithm combinations identifies Agglomerative clustering at k=15 on 4D UMAP as optimal (silhouette 0.664 +/- 0.008, trustworthiness/continuity 0.805/0.812). The approach reveals four organizational patterns: artist-specific methodological cohesion, technique-based segmentation, temporal artistic evolution, and trans-temporal conceptual affinities. By separating analytical optimization from public communication, I provide rigorous analysis and accessible exploration through an interactive web interface (https://www.bioartlas.com) with the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/joonhyungbae/BioArtlas).

<details>

Motivation: 跨语言信息检索因资源、文字差异和弱跨语言语义对齐有挑战，现有管道有计算开销和噪声。

Method: 在三个基准数据集上系统评估四种干预类型，包括文档翻译、预训练编码器的多语言密集检索、不同层次对比学习和交叉编码器重排序。

Result: 特定CLIR训练的密集检索模型表现优于词汇匹配方法，对比学习可缓解语言偏差，重排序效果依赖训练数据质量，低资源和跨文字对提升明显。

Conclusion: 跨语言搜索系统应优先考虑语义多语言嵌入和针对性学习对齐，尤其针对跨文字和资源不足语言。

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.

Motivation: 评估多语言大模型及微调变体在不同生成扩展策略下，驱动跨语言检索性能的因素。

Method: 评估多语言大模型及微调变体在几种生成扩展策略下的表现。

Result: 查询长度决定提示技术有效性，复杂提示未必有更多收益；语言差异大，特定语言改进大，不同书写体系间检索差；微调在训练和测试数据格式相似时有效。

Conclusion: 需要更平衡的多语言和跨语言训练与评估资源。

Abstract: Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的伪相关反馈在扩展查询时未充分利用传统反馈模型，探究是否有更优方式。

Method: 在HyDE中系统评估传统反馈模型，如使用Rocchio等算法提取和加权扩展词。

Result: 使用如Rocchio等反馈算法可显著提高HyDE的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用传统反馈算法是进一步提高基于大语言模型的伪相关反馈方法准确性的简单途径。

Abstract: Recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs) for pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) have generally not utilized well-established feedback models like Rocchio and RM3 when expanding queries for sparse retrievers like BM25. Instead, they often opt for a simple string concatenation of the query and LLM-generated expansion content. But is this optimal? To answer this question, we revisit and systematically evaluate traditional feedback models in the context of HyDE, a popular method that enriches query representations with LLM-generated hypothetical answer documents. Our experiments show that HyDE's effectiveness can be substantially improved when leveraging feedback algorithms such as Rocchio to extract and weight expansion terms, providing a simple way to further enhance the accuracy of LLM-based PRF methods.

Motivation: 临床中CIU分析因需人工编码和分析而受限，机器学习发展可自动化建模，故评估其识别CIU的可靠性。

Method: 用随机选择的人类编码转录本及失语症患者的字词和CIU训练五种监督式机器学习模型。

Result: 字词与非字词识别准确率高，模型表现近乎完美；CIU与非CIU识别变异性大，k - 近邻模型准确率最高。

Conclusion: 监督式机器学习模型区分字词容易，但识别CIU具有挑战性。

Abstract: Analyzing spoken discourse is a valid means of quantifying language ability in persons with aphasia. There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging.

Abstract: This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms have long been the topic of research, representing the more popular side of unsupervised learning. Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \textit{k} means method. We also address some interesting possible research topics that reveal themselves as we answer the questions we initially set out to address.

Result: 在三个微服务基准数据集上的实验表明，CCLH在RCL和FTI方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCLH框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，能更好地进行微服务系统根因分析。

Abstract: Root cause analysis in microservice systems typically involves two core tasks: root cause localization (RCL) and failure type identification (FTI). Despite substantial research efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still face two key challenges. First, these methods predominantly adopt a joint learning paradigm for RCL and FTI to exploit shared information and reduce training time. However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing. To overcome these limitations, we propose CCLH, a novel root cause analysis framework that orchestrates diagnostic tasks based on cascaded conditional learning. CCLH provides a three-level taxonomy for group influences between instances and incorporates a heterogeneous hypergraph to model these relationships, facilitating the simulation of failure propagation. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from three microservice benchmarks demonstrate that CCLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both RCL and FTI.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments requires efficient inference serving systems that balance throughput, latency, and resource utilization. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of two prominent open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM and HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.

Motivation: 解决离线强化学习在数据损坏情况下易失败的问题，认为数据损坏导致损失景观出现尖锐最小值，影响泛化能力。

Method: 首次将Sharpness - Aware Minimization (SAM) 作为通用、即插即用的优化器应用于离线RL，将其集成到IQL和RIQL算法中，并在D4RL基准上进行评估。

Result: SAM增强的方法在有随机和对抗性损坏的D4RL基准测试中始终显著优于原始基线，奖励表面可视化证实SAM能找到更平滑的解决方案。

Conclusion: SAM在提高离线RL代理的鲁棒性方面非常有效。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to real-world data corruption, with even robust algorithms failing under challenging observation and mixture corruptions. We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.

Conclusion: AutoSAGE能有效提升稀疏GNN聚合性能，且开源资源方便复现。

Abstract: Sparse GNN aggregations (CSR SpMM/SDDMM) vary widely in performance with degree skew, feature width, and GPU micro-architecture. We present AutoSAGE, an input-aware CUDA scheduler that chooses tiling and mapping per input using a lightweight estimate refined by on-device micro-probes, with a guardrail that safely falls back to vendor kernels and a persistent cache for deterministic replay. AutoSAGE covers SpMM and SDDMM and composes into a CSR attention pipeline (SDDMM -> row-softmax -> SpMM). On Reddit and OGBN-Products, it matches vendor baselines at bandwidth-bound feature widths and finds gains at small widths; on synthetic sparsity and skew stress tests it achieves up to 4.7x kernel-level speedups. We release CUDA sources, Python bindings, a reproducible harness, and replayable cache logs.

Conclusion: 发布的Binary BPE分词器为二进制语言模型和工具提供开源基础，可提升研究和实践效率。

Abstract: Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, large language models have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical equation solving. However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 传统激活稀疏化以模型为中心，忽略访问模式对闪存性能的影响，需改进以提升I/O效率。

Method: 提出Neuron Chunking策略，以内存中连续神经元组为操作单元，结合神经元重要性和存储访问成本，通过访问连续性轻量级抽象建模I/O延迟，选择高效用块。

Result: 在Jetson Orin Nano和Jetson AGX Orin上分别将I/O效率提高4.65倍和5.76倍。

Conclusion: Neuron Chunking策略通过使稀疏化决策与底层存储行为一致，有效提高了I/O效率。

Abstract: Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.

Conclusion: MVA框架能有效解决大语言模型多价值对齐问题，相比现有方法有明显优势。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values.

Abstract: Modeling the cognitive and experiential factors of human navigation is central to deepening our understanding of human-environment interaction and to enabling safe social navigation and effective assistive wayfinding. Most existing methods focus on forecasting motions in fully observed scenes and often neglect human factors that capture how people feel and respond to space. To address this gap, We propose EgoCogNav, a multimodal egocentric navigation framework that predicts perceived path uncertainty as a latent state and jointly forecasts trajectories and head motion by fusing scene features with sensory cues. To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that EgoCogNav learns the perceived uncertainty that highly correlates with human-like behaviors such as scanning, hesitation, and backtracking while generalizing to unseen environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In list-decodable learning, we are given a set of data points such that an $α$-fraction of these points come from a nice distribution $D$, for some small $α\ll 1$, and the goal is to output a short list of candidate solutions, such that at least one element of this list recovers some non-trivial information about $D$. By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $α$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / α$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $ε> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $α$ and $ε$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $ε$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \exp \left( O\left( \tfrac{\log^2 1 / α}{ε^2} \right)\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\ell_2$ distance at most $ε$ to the true mean. We also design an algorithm that outputs such a list with runtime and sample complexity $n = d^{O(\log L)} + \exp \exp (\widetilde{O}(\log L))$. We do so by demonstrating a completely novel proof of identifiability, as well as a new algorithmic way of leveraging this proof without the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which may be of independent technical interest.

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法对所有token应用静态、与输入无关的更新，会导致过拟合或欠适应问题，尤其是在自回归设置中。

Method: 提出GateRA框架，引入token感知调制，结合自适应门控；引入基于熵的正则化；进行理论分析。

Result: 经验可视化显示GateRA能自动抑制冗余预填充token的更新，强调解码时的适应；实验表明在多个常识推理基准上优于或持平先前PEFT方法。

Conclusion: GateRA能对PEFT路径产生软梯度掩码效应，实现对适应的连续可微控制，是一种有效的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, DoRA, and HiRA, enable lightweight adaptation of large pre-trained models via low-rank updates. However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.

Motivation: Flow Matching因依赖学习的弯曲轨迹，一步生成能力有限，现有解决方法存在离散近似误差、训练不稳定和收敛困难等问题。

Method: 提出Straight Variational Flow Matching (S - VFM)，将表示“生成概述”的变分潜在代码集成到Flow Matching框架中，显式强制轨迹直线性。

Result: 在三个挑战基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: S - VFM相比现有方法在训练和推理效率上有优势。

Abstract: Flow Matching has limited ability in achieving one-step generation due to its reliance on learned curved trajectories. Previous studies have attempted to address this limitation by either modifying the coupling distribution to prevent interpolant intersections or introducing consistency and mean-velocity modeling to promote straight trajectory learning. However, these approaches often suffer from discrete approximation errors, training instability, and convergence difficulties. To tackle these issues, in the present work, we propose \textbf{S}traight \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching (\textbf{S-VFM}), which integrates a variational latent code representing the ``generation overview'' into the Flow Matching framework. \textbf{S-VFM} explicitly enforces trajectory straightness, ideally producing linear generation paths. The proposed method achieves competitive performance across three challenge benchmarks and demonstrates advantages in both training and inference efficiency compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD.
  As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.

Conclusion: 该工作为提升脑启发导航技术实用性提供新策略，有进一步拓展潜力。

Abstract: The brain's Path Integration (PI) mechanism offers substantial guidance and inspiration for Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN). However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM. This work offers a novel implementation strategy to enhance the practicality of BIN technology and holds potential for further extension.

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MOSI和MOSEI上实验表明PaSE性能优越，有效缓解模态竞争。

Conclusion: PaSE框架能提升多模态情感分析性能，有效缓解模态竞争。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual signals. Although multimodal fusion is designed to leverage cross-modal complementarity, real-world scenarios often exhibit modality competition: dominant modalities tend to overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.In this paper, we propose PaSE, a novel Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-optimized Equilibrium framework, which enhances collaboration while explicitly mitigating modality competition. PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI confirm that PaSE achieves the superior performance and effectively alleviates modality competition.

Conclusion: 首次给出非质心聚类在最大损失目标下核心可能为空的不可能结果。

Abstract: We study core stability in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective, where each agent's loss is the maximum distance to other members of their cluster. We prove that for all $k\geq 3$ there exist metric instances with $n\ge 9$ agents, with $n$ divisible by $k$, for which no clustering lies in the $α$-core for any $α<2^{\frac{1}{5}}\sim 1.148$. The bound is tight for our construction. Using a computer-aided proof, we also identify a two-dimensional Euclidean point set whose associated lower bound is slightly smaller than that of our general construction. This is, to our knowledge, the first impossibility result showing that the core can be empty in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective.

Result: 在两个公开SRS数据集上，EIGML始终优于现有基线，实现更高准确率，更好理解情感和意图特征。

Conclusion: EIGML框架有效减少孤立建模的偏差，提高贴纸选择性能。

Abstract: Stickers are widely used in online communication to convey emotions and implicit intentions. The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue. However, existing methods typically rely on semantic matching and model emotional and intentional cues separately, which can lead to mismatches when emotions and intentions are misaligned. To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism. This design injects rich, effective information into the model and enables a deeper understanding of the dialogue, ultimately enhancing sticker selection performance. Experimental results on two public SRS datasets show that EIGML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy and a better understanding of emotional and intentional features.

Result: 实验显示ADF - LoRA收敛更快更平滑，在多个GLUE任务上平均准确率最高，持续优于现有LoRA变体。

Conclusion: ADF - LoRA能在无服务器拓扑中提高稳定性，实现更好的性能。

Abstract: This paper revisits alternating low-rank updates for federated fine-tuning and examines their behavior in decentralized federated learning (DFL). While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin.

Beyond compression, Llamazip demonstrates the potential to identify whether a document was part of the training dataset of a language model. This capability addresses critical concerns about data provenance, intellectual property, and transparency in language model training.

Result: 将CycleSL集成到之前算法中，在五个公开数据集上进行基准测试，证明其能提升模型性能。

Conclusion: CycleSL是有效的，能增强拆分学习的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Split learning emerges as a promising paradigm for collaborative distributed model training, akin to federated learning, by partitioning neural networks between clients and a server without raw data exchange. However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance. Our source code is available at https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/CycleSL.

Conclusion: SHAP Distance是评估合成表格数据语义保真度的实用且有区分度的工具，并为未来基准测试流程提供指导。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.

Result: 结合内容 - 风格分离和注意力驱动原型聚合，在异构环境中提升个性化和鲁棒性，不增加通信成本。

Conclusion: FedSTAR框架有效解决个性化联邦学习问题，减少通信开销，提升性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) faces persistent challenges, including domain heterogeneity from diverse client data, data imbalance due to skewed participation, and strict communication constraints. Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.
  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.
  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a mature technology, often suggested as a potential route towards Artificial General Intelligence, with the ambitious goal of replicating the wide range of abilities found in natural and artificial intelligence, including the complexities of human cognition. While RL had shown successes in relatively constrained environments, such as the classic Atari games and specific continuous control problems, recent years have seen efforts to expand its applicability. This work investigates the potential of RL in demonstrating intelligent behaviour and its progress in addressing more complex and less structured problem domains.
  We present an investigation into the capacity of modern RL frameworks in addressing a seemingly straightforward 3D Same-Different visuospatial task. While initial applications of state-of-the-art methods, including PPO, behavioural cloning and imitation learning, revealed challenges in directly learning optimal strategies, the successful implementation of curriculum learning offers a promising avenue. Effective learning was achieved by strategically designing the lesson plan based on the findings of a real-world human experiment.

Abstract: Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.

Conclusion: 重新思考投影和预测之间的界限有益，为高效大语言模型训练提供了实用的系统优化方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.

Abstract: Automated scoring of written constructed responses typically relies on separate models per task, straining computational resources, storage, and maintenance in real-world education settings. We propose UniMoE-Guided, a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach that transfers expertise from multiple task-specific large models (teachers) into a single compact, deployable model (student). The student combines (i) a shared encoder for cross-task representations, (ii) a gated MoE block that balances shared and task-specific processing, and (iii) lightweight task heads. Trained with both ground-truth labels and teacher guidance, the student matches strong task-specific models while being far more efficient to train, store, and deploy. Beyond efficiency, the MoE layer improves transfer and generalization: experts develop reusable skills that boost cross-task performance and enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal additions and tuning. On nine NGSS-aligned science-reasoning tasks (seven for training/evaluation and two held out for adaptation), UniMoE-Guided attains performance comparable to per-task models while using $\sim$6$\times$ less storage than maintaining separate students, and $87\times$ less than the 20B-parameter teacher. The method offers a practical path toward scalable, reliable, and resource-efficient automated scoring for classroom and large-scale assessment systems.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become essential for training foundation models, yet benchmark contamination threatens evaluation integrity. Although existing detection methods identify token-level overlap, they fail to detect semantic-level contamination where synthetic data conceptually resemble benchmarks without lexical overlap. This gap is critical as foundation models increasingly train on synthetic data that may implicitly encode benchmark knowledge. We propose a hierarchical contamination detection framework operating at four levels: token level, semantic level, reasoning pattern, and performance cliff detection. Through controlled experiments on MMLU, GSM8K and HumanEval, we demonstrate that semantic-level contamination evades existing methods (F1=0.17-0.49) but is effectively detected by our hierarchical approach (F1 = 0.76), with an average improvement of 26. 5\% over state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework provides practitioners with practical tools for audit pipelines and enables responsible deployment of synthetic training data.

Abstract: Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.

Motivation: 现有临床和基因组模型常以简单线性规则结合，未考虑风险评分关系，尤其是极端情况，研究直接建模两者联合关系能否改善风险分层。

Method: 使用METABRIC乳腺癌队列，创建5年癌症死亡二元结局，定义临床和基因组预测变量集，训练随机森林和XGBoost等分类器，用5折交叉验证预测概率作风险评分，转换为伪观测值拟合高斯、Clayton和Gumbel copulas。

Conclusion: 基于copula的融合在真实队列中可行，考虑评分间依赖性能更好识别预后最差患者亚组。

Abstract: Clinical and genomic models are both used to predict breast cancer outcomes, but they are often combined using simple linear rules that do not account for how their risk scores relate, especially at the extremes. Using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, we studied whether directly modeling the joint relationship between clinical and genomic machine learning risk scores could improve risk stratification for 5-year cancer-specific mortality. We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set. These results show that copula-based fusion works in real-world cohorts and that considering dependencies between scores can better identify patient subgroups with the worst prognosis.

Abstract: Understanding brain function represents a fundamental goal in neuroscience, with critical implications for therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications. Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods. Beyond optimal performance, conditional generation applications show two capabilities: generalizing to unseen behavioral contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding accuracy using synthetic neural data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of energy-based modeling for neural population dynamics with applications in neuroscience research and neural engineering.

Abstract: Triathlon training, which involves high-volume swimming, cycling, and running, places athletes at substantial risk for overuse injuries due to repetitive physiological stress. Current injury prediction approaches primarily rely on training load metrics, often neglecting critical factors such as sleep quality, stress, and individual lifestyle patterns that significantly influence recovery and injury susceptibility.
  We introduce a novel synthetic data generation framework tailored explicitly for triathlon. This framework generates physiologically plausible athlete profiles, simulates individualized training programs that incorporate periodization and load-management principles, and integrates daily-life factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and recovery states. We evaluated machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost) showing high predictive performance (AUC up to 0.86), identifying sleep disturbances, heart rate variability, and stress as critical early indicators of injury risk. This wearable-driven approach not only enhances injury prediction accuracy but also provides a practical solution to overcoming real-world data limitations, offering a pathway toward a holistic, context-aware athlete monitoring.

Abstract: Supervised learning with large-scale data usually leads to complex optimization problems, especially for classification tasks with multiple classes. Stochastic subgradient methods can enable efficient learning with a large number of samples for classification techniques that minimize the average loss over the training samples. However, recent techniques, such as minimax risk classifiers (MRCs), minimize the maximum expected loss and are not amenable to stochastic subgradient methods. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm based on the combination of constraint and column generation that enables efficient learning of MRCs with large-scale data for classification tasks with multiple classes. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm provides upto a 10x speedup for general large-scale data and around a 100x speedup with a sizeable number of classes.

Abstract: Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.
  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.
  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.

Abstract: We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.
  This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.
  We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), affecting millions worldwide, exhibits complex pathophysiology manifested through disrupted brain network dynamics. Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Agnostic learning of Boolean halfspaces is a fundamental problem in computational learning theory, but it is known to be computationally hard even for weak learning. Recent work [CKKMK24] proposed smoothed analysis as a way to bypass such hardness, but existing frameworks rely on additive Gaussian perturbations, making them unsuitable for discrete domains. We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips. This defines a natural discrete analogue of smoothed optimality generalizing the Gaussian case. Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor. Previously, such algorithms were known only with strong structural assumptions for the discrete hypercube, for example, independent coordinates or symmetric distributions. Our result provides the first computationally efficient guarantee for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces over the Boolean hypercube, bridging the gap between worst-case intractability and practical learnability in discrete settings.

We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10.

Abstract: Probabilistic load forecasting is widely studied and underpins power system planning, operation, and risk-aware decision making. Deep learning forecasters have shown strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns, achieving substantial accuracy gains. However, at the scale of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of loads in large distribution feeders, a deployment dilemma emerges: training and maintaining one model per customer is computationally and storage intensive, while using a single global model ignores distributional shifts across customer types, locations, and phases. Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters. Evaluated on realistic utility data, M2OE2-GL yields substantial error reductions while remaining scalable to very large numbers of loads.

Abstract: Verifying uniform conditions over continuous spaces through random sampling is fundamental in machine learning and control theory, yet classical coverage analyses often yield conservative bounds, particularly at small failure probabilities. We study uniform random sampling on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube and analyze the number of uncovered subcubes after discretization. By applying a concentration inequality to the uncovered-count statistic, we derive a sample complexity bound with a logarithmic dependence on the failure probability ($δ$), i.e., $M =O( \tilde{C}\ln(\frac{2\tilde{C}}δ))$, which contrasts sharply with the classical linear $1/δ$ dependence. Under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions, we present a self-contained derivation and compare our result with classical coupon-collector rates. Numerical studies across dimensions, precision levels, and confidence targets indicate that our bound tracks practical coverage requirements more tightly and scales favorably as $δ\to 0$. Our findings offer a sharper theoretical tool for algorithms that rely on grid-based coverage guarantees, enabling more efficient sampling, especially in high-confidence regimes.

Conclusion: 此次初始版本为未来理论扩展、基准研究及与经典和量子模拟平台集成奠定基础。

Abstract: QML-HCS is a research-grade framework for constructing and analyzing quantum-inspired machine learning models operating under hypercausal feedback dynamics. Hypercausal refers to AI systems that leverage extended, deep, or nonlinear causal relationships (expanded causality) to reason, predict, and infer states beyond the capabilities of traditional causal models. Current machine learning and quantum-inspired systems struggle in non-stationary environments, where data distributions drift and models lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation, causal stability, and coherent state updating. QML-HCS addresses this limitation through a unified computational architecture that integrates quantum-inspired superposition principles, dynamic causal feedback, and deterministic-stochastic hybrid execution to enable adaptive behavior in changing environments.
  The framework implements a hypercausal processing core capable of reversible transformations, multipath causal propagation, and evaluation of alternative states under drift. Its architecture incorporates continuous feedback to preserve causal consistency and adjust model behavior without requiring full retraining. QML-HCS provides a reproducible and extensible Python interface backed by efficient computational routines, enabling experimentation in quantum-inspired learning, causal reasoning, and hybrid computation without the need for specialized hardware.
  A minimal simulation demonstrates how a hypercausal model adapts to a sudden shift in the input distribution while preserving internal coherence. This initial release establishes the foundational architecture for future theoretical extensions, benchmarking studies, and integration with classical and quantum simulation platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签特征选择方法不适用于分布式和联邦环境，且联邦方法假设客户端有标签数据不现实。

Method: 提出SSFMLFS方法，客户端仅持有无标签数据，服务器有有限标签数据，适应模糊信息理论到联邦设置，构建特征图并用PageRank对特征排序。

Result: 在五个不同领域的真实数据集上实验表明，SSFMLFS在非IID数据分布设置下，在三种评估指标上优于其他联邦和集中式监督与半监督方法。

Conclusion: SSFMLFS是一种有效的半监督联邦多标签特征选择方法。

Abstract: Multi-label feature selection (FS) reduces the dimensionality of multi-label data by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant features, thereby boosting the performance of multi-label learning models. However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting.

Result: 在SEVIR和MeteoNet数据集实验中，RectiCast较现有方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: RectiCast框架能有效解决现有降水临近预报方法问题，提升预报准确性。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which aims to provide high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation forecasts by leveraging current radar observations, is a core task in regional weather forecasting. The cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict macroscopic trends (or posterior mean), followed by a probabilistic model to generate local details (or local stochasticity). However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the deterministic component's distribution shift contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the correction of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on SEVIR and MeteoNet demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在MIMIC - IV代理标签预测和欺诈检测基准上，AF - SMOTE比强过采样基线方法有更高召回率、平均精度和最佳校准，在多个额外数据集上也有验证。

Conclusion: AF - SMOTE在临床情况有实际价值，能避免罕见病漏诊。

Abstract: We study classification under extreme class imbalance where recall and calibration are both critical, for example in medical diagnosis scenarios. We propose AF-SMOTE, a mathematically motivated augmentation framework that first synthesizes minority points and then filters them by an adversarial discriminator and a boundary utility model. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the decision boundary smoothness and class-conditional densities, our filtering step monotonically improves a surrogate of F_beta (for beta >= 1) while not inflating Brier score. On MIMIC-IV proxy label prediction and canonical fraud detection benchmarks, AF-SMOTE attains higher recall and average precision than strong oversampling baselines (SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE), and yields the best calibration. We further validate these gains across multiple additional datasets beyond MIMIC-IV. Our successful application of AF-SMOTE to a healthcare dataset using a proxy label demonstrates in a disease-agnostic way its practical value in clinical situations, where missing true positive cases in rare diseases can have severe consequences.

Motivation: 现有LLM服务框架在系统配置变化时存在非确定性，不同TP大小下的确定性问题未解决，在RL中会导致性能问题。

Method: 分析TP诱导不一致的根源，提出基于统一分层二叉树结构的Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK) 原语，并在Triton实现，集成到vLLM和FSDP。

Conclusion: TBIK原语能有效解决不同TP大小下大语言模型确定性推理问题，实现位级一致。

Abstract: Deterministic inference is increasingly critical for large language model (LLM) applications such as LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, multi-agent systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy. Code is available at https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

Abstract: Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.

Motivation: RL和SFT是使Transformer获得CoT能力的主要方法，但理论上其潜在机制和差异尚不清楚，本文旨在研究这些方面。

Method: 使用单层Transformer和类似CoT的中间监督来学习k - 稀疏布尔函数，分析通过RL或SFT微调Transformer的学习动态，确定可证明学习这些函数的充分条件。

Result: 验证了三个基本例子（k - PARITY、k - AND和k - OR）满足条件，证明两种方法的可学习性，发现RL同时学习整个CoT链，SFT逐步学习CoT链。

Conclusion: 研究结果为RL和SFT的潜在机制以及它们在触发Transformer的CoT能力方面的差异提供了理论见解。

Abstract: Transformers can acquire Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities to solve complex reasoning tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers.

Method: 提出Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering (EFDMVC)框架，通过客户端内层次对比融合解决视图不确定性，用视图自适应漂移模块缓解聚合不确定性，还有平衡聚合机制协调客户端更新。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，EFDMVC对异构不确定视图展现出优越的鲁棒性，综合评估中始终优于所有现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EFDMVC能有效解决联邦多视图聚类中的双不确定性问题，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Traditional Federated Multi-View Clustering assumes uniform views across clients, yet practical deployments reveal heterogeneous view completeness with prevalent incomplete, redundant, or corrupted data. While recent approaches model view heterogeneity, they neglect semantic conflicts from dynamic view combinations, failing to address dual uncertainties: view uncertainty (semantic inconsistency from arbitrary view pairings) and aggregation uncertainty (divergent client updates with imbalanced contributions). To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates. Experimental results demonstrate that EFDMVC achieves superior robustness against heterogeneous uncertain views across multiple benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines in comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: 所提算法有效且在预测效率上优于其他共形训练方法。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a general framework to quantify the predictive uncertainty of machine learning models that uses a set prediction to include the true label with a valid probability. To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size.

We implement agile machine learning-based control loops in the digital twin to optimize induction furnace heating, enhance operational quality, and reduce process waste. Key to our approach is a Deep Reinforcement learning-based agent used in our machine learning operation (MLOps) driven system to autonomously correlate the system state with its digital twin to identify correction actions that aim to optimize power settings for the plant. We present the theoretical basis, architectural details, and practical implications of our approach to reduce manufacturing waste and increase production quality. We design the system for flexibility so that our scalable event-driven architecture can be adapted to various industrial applications.

Abstract: For online ad-recommendation systems, processing complete user-ad-engagement histories is both computationally intensive and noise-prone. We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.

Conclusion: PocketLLM是一种有效的大语言模型压缩方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, storing and transmitting them on edge devices becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional methods like quantization and pruning struggle to achieve extreme compression of LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce PocketLLM, a novel approach to compress LLMs in a latent space via meta-networks. A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index. Extensive experiments show that PocketLLM achieves superior performance even at significantly high compression ratios, e.g., compressing Llama 2-7B by 10x with a negligible drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能以最少的标记数据实现跨不同光纤配置的稳健事件识别。

Abstract: Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data.
  Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: 为无数据AI知识转移和自我改进模型生态系统建立理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.

Motivation: 解决内存受限下流数据模型更新时顺序微调易出现灾难性遗忘，且重放在不同目标下的行为不明的问题。

Method: 将顺序微调与重放视为理想联合目标的随机梯度方法，通过梯度对齐分析何时混合样本可减少遗忘，在六个流场景下评估单一重放机制。

Result: 在异构多任务流上，重放使平均遗忘减少2 - 3倍；在良性时间流上，两种方法表现相近。

Conclusion: 有状态重放可作为流环境中持续学习的强大且简单的基线。

Abstract: Many deployed learning systems must update models on streaming data under memory constraints. The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.

Motivation: 为最大化LTV/CAC比率，需早期预测渠道级LTV以优化预算分配，但LTV预测存在数据未对齐、SILO和序列不稳定等挑战。

Method: 提出Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF)框架，引入梯形多时间序列模块处理数据未对齐和SILO挑战，用MT - FusionNet多塔结构输出准确预测。

Result: 框架部署到抖音在线系统后，LTV曲线的点式MAPE（MAPEp）降低4.3%，聚合LTV的MAPE（MAPEa）降低3.2%。

Conclusion: TTF框架能有效应对LTV预测挑战，降低预测误差，可用于实际业务优化预算分配。

Abstract: In the user growth scenario, Internet companies invest heavily in paid acquisition channels to acquire new users. But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet. The framework has been deployed to the online system for Douyin. Compared to the previously deployed online model, MAPEp decreased by 4.3%, and MAPEa decreased by 3.2%, where MAPEp denotes the point-wise MAPE of the LTV curve and MAPEa denotes the MAPE of the aggregated LTV.

Conclusion: 可以利用不同环境间的不变性持续改进学习。

Abstract: Intelligent agents equipped with causal knowledge can optimize their action spaces to avoid unnecessary exploration. The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.

Conclusion: 分块提取并带有明确证书对实际transformer语言模型可行，为机械可解释性和模型行为形式推理提供实用桥梁。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.

Conclusion: MamTiff - CAD对长序列（60 - 256）CAD模型生成有效。

Abstract: Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.

Abstract: Clustering in stationary and nonstationary settings, where data distributions remain static or evolve over time, requires models that can adapt to distributional shifts while preserving previously learned cluster structures. This paper proposes an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based topological clustering algorithm that autonomously adjusts its recalculation interval and vigilance threshold through a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism. This mechanism enables hyperparameter-free learning that maintains cluster stability and continuity in dynamic environments. Experiments on 24 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clustering performance and continual learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed parameter adaptation in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent clustering in evolving data streams.

Abstract: Minimizing loss functions is central to machine-learning training. Although first-order methods dominate practical applications, higher-order techniques such as Newton's method can deliver greater accuracy and faster convergence, yet are often avoided due to their computational cost. This work analyzes the impact of finite-precision arithmetic on Newton steps and establishes a convergence theorem for mixed-precision Newton optimizers, including "quasi" and "inexact" variants. The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets. The second part of the manuscript introduces GN_k, a generalized Gauss-Newton method that enables partial computation of second-order derivatives. GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.

Conclusion: 学习率感知分解在私有训练中优于前缀和分解，能提高准确性。

Abstract: We study differentially private model training with stochastic gradient descent under learning rate scheduling and correlated noise. Although correlated noise, in particular via matrix factorizations, has been shown to improve accuracy, prior theoretical work focused primarily on the prefix-sum workload. That workload assumes a constant learning rate, whereas in practice learning rate schedules are widely used to accelerate training and improve convergence. We close this gap by deriving general upper and lower bounds for a broad class of learning rate schedules in both single- and multi-epoch settings. Building on these results, we propose a learning-rate-aware factorization that achieves improvements over prefix-sum factorizations under both MaxSE and MeanSE error metrics. Our theoretical analysis yields memory-efficient constructions suitable for practical deployment, and experiments on CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets confirm that schedule-aware factorizations improve accuracy in private training.

Abstract: Advances in technology are transforming sustainable cattle farming practices, with electronic feeding systems generating big longitudinal datasets on individual animal feed intake, offering the possibility for autonomous precision livestock systems. However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering seeks to uncover nested structures in data by constructing a tree of clusters, where deeper levels reveal finer-grained relationships. Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the linkage function under which this procedure exactly recovers the finest valid hierarchy, and we show that all linkage functions satisfying these conditions yield the same hierarchy after pruning. Notably, classical linkage rules such as single, complete, and average satisfy these conditions, whereas Ward's linkage fails to do so.

Abstract: Modern cities produce vast streams of heterogeneous data, from infrastructure maps to mobility logs and satellite imagery. However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

Abstract: Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical to understanding complex scientific and engineering phenomena, yet traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive. Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method. Our method not only reduces average error but also the 99\%, 95\%, and 50\% quantiles of error, which is rare for an AL algorithm. All in all, our approach offers a data-efficient solution to surrogate modeling for PDEs.

Abstract: Global routing is a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA) that enables early estimation and optimization of the routability of modern integrated circuits with respect to congestion, power dissipation, and design complexity. Batching is a primary concern in top-performing global routers, grouping nets into manageable sets to enable parallel processing and efficient resource usage. This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a novel batching algorithm enhanced with Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) is introduced in this paper, enabling more effective parallelization by generating fewer higher-quality batches in less time. The proposed algorithm is tested on the latest ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% runtime reduction with only 0.002% degradation in routing quality as compared to state-of-the-art router.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to improve upon classical machine learning algorithms. Currently, robust uncertainty quantification methods remain underdeveloped in the quantum domain, despite the critical need for reliable and trustworthy predictions. Recent work has introduced quantum conformal prediction, a framework that produces prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true outcome with user-specified probability. In this work, we formalise how the time-varying noise inherent in quantum processors can undermine conformal guarantees, even when calibration and test data are exchangeable. To address this challenge, we draw on Adaptive Conformal Inference, a method which maintains validity over time via repeated recalibration. We introduce Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP), an algorithm which preserves asymptotic average coverage guarantees under arbitrary hardware noise conditions. Empirical studies on an IBM quantum processor demonstrate that AQCP achieves target coverage levels and exhibits greater stability than quantum conformal prediction.

Abstract: Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.

Abstract: Fine-tuning BERT for text classification can be computationally challenging and requires careful hyper-parameter tuning. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform conventional methods in machine learning and text classification tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates an n-qubit quantum circuit with a classical BERT model for text classification. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned classical-quantum BERT and demonstrate its feasibility as well as its potential in advancing this research area. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model achieves performance that is competitive with, and in some cases better than, the classical baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the adaptability of classical-quantum models for fine-tuning pre-trained models across diverse datasets. Overall, the hybrid model highlights the promise of quantum computing in achieving improved performance for text classification tasks.

Result: 在ImageNet子集上的实验表明，BSS在可迁移性方面优于现有基于输入变换的攻击方法。

Conclusion: BSS方法有效提升可迁移性，建议在统一数量规模下评估基于输入变换的攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.

Conclusion: DeepCoT能在保证性能的同时，有效降低计算成本和运行时间。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have dramatically increased their size and parameter count to tackle increasingly complex tasks. At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.

Method: 提出FMAPLS和online - FMAPLS，利用批量和在线EM算法优化参数，引入LSF降低计算复杂度，在线版本用随机近似替换批量E步。

Conclusion: 所提方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性，适用于大规模和动态学习场景。

Abstract: Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\boldsymbolα$ and class priors $\boldsymbolπ$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty. These results confirm the robustness, scalability, and suitability of the proposed methods for large-scale and dynamic learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MoB是BoN和Self - consistency的简单且强大替代方案，能推动更细致选择机制研究。

Abstract: Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.

Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices enable liquid biopsy for cancer detection by separating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples based on size, but designing these microfluidic devices requires computationally expensive Navier-Stokes simulations and particle-tracing analyses. While recent surrogate modeling approaches using deep learning have accelerated this process, they often inadequately handle the critical periodic boundary conditions of DLD unit cells, leading to cumulative errors in multi-unit device predictions. This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications.

Result: 在标签噪声下恢复大部分损失的效用，对后门触发器几乎消除攻击且对效用损害小，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CUTS方法在源自由的纠正性机器去学习中有效。

Abstract: Corrupted training data are ubiquitous. Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.

Abstract: Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity, and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives. OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model development, evaluation, and comparison. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Ocean-Intelligent-Forecasting/OceanForecastBench.

Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices are widely used in microfluidics for label-free, size-based separation of particles and cells, with particular promise in isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer diagnostics. This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization. This integrative approach advances the development of scalable and precise microfluidic systems for cancer diagnostics, contributing to the broader goals of early detection and personalized medicine.

Conclusion: SC - SSL能有效解决半监督学习中的类别不平衡问题，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL), especially when distributional mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data lead to biased classification. Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL.

Conclusion: CLLNs在强化学习中有应用潜力，与数字计算机和生物系统有不同特点。

Abstract: Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.

Abstract: We study the problem of excess risk evaluation for empirical risk minimization (ERM) under general convex loss functions. Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor-imagery decoding remains a major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces due to strong subject variability and the curved geometry of covariance matrices on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. We address the zero-shot cross-subject setting, where no target-subject labels or adaptation are allowed, by introducing novel geometry-aware preprocessing modules and deep congruence networks that operate directly on SPD covariance matrices. Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations. On the BCI-IV 2a benchmark, our framework improves cross-subject accuracy by 3-4% over the strongest classical baselines, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware transformations for robust EEG decoding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their massive parameter counts create substantial computational and memory challenges during deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 异构变换选择对大语言模型的最优量化是必要的。

Abstract: Large language models require significant computational resources for deployment, making quantization essential for practical applications. However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.

Conclusion: MDMs可作为具有可学习顺序的自回归模型。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.

Abstract: Searching large and complex design spaces for a global optimum can be infeasible and unnecessary. A practical alternative is to iteratively refine the neighborhood of an initial design using local optimization methods such as gradient descent. We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.

Abstract: Indoor localization using machine learning has gained traction due to the growing demand for location-based services. However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a graded formulation of internal symbolic computation for transformers. The hidden space is endowed with a grading $V=\bigoplus_{g\in G}V_g$, and symbolic operations are realized as typed block maps (morphisms) $φ_{h\leftarrow g}:V_g\to V_h$ that are activated selectively by a differentiable routing policy. A self-supervised \emph{graded utility functional}, defined as the loss reduction induced by a candidate morphism, governs activation and yields sparse, interpretable behavior. We develop the algebraic and geometric foundations: an internal model category whose objects are homogeneous components and whose morphisms are admissible grade transitions; adjoint pairs encoding typed round trips; and information-geometric interpretations in terms of KL gain, mirror descent with Bregman divergences, and Fisher natural gradients. Methodologically, we specify a utility--aware routing mechanism and objective that remain fully end-to-end differentiable. Analytic case studies and lightweight sanity checks illustrate selective morphic activation on hybrid symbolic-linguistic tasks. The framework unifies symbolic computation, geometry, and self--supervised learning within the \emph{graded transformer} formalism \cite{sh-89,sh-95}, while subsuming prior external-tool paradigms (e.g., Toolformer \cite{toolformer2023}) as a special case via functorial internalization.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.

Abstract: Recent research has established that the impact of context in a vanilla transformer can be represented implicitly by forming a token-dependent, rank-1 patch to its MLP weights. This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability. We prove that a perfect implicit weight patch is possible for any MLP block where the inner function is input-controllable and the outer function is output-controllable. This provides a simpler and more powerful lens for understanding how transformer models transmute prompts into effective weights. This setup generalizes to a wide range of modern LLM architectures including gating, pre-/post-norm, mixture of experts and sequential/parallel transformer blocks.

Abstract: Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.

Abstract: Maintaining economic efficiency and operational reliability in microgrid energy management systems under cyberattack conditions remains challenging. Most approaches assume non-anomalous measurements, make predictions with unquantified uncertainties, and do not mitigate malicious attacks on renewable forecasts for energy management optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-resilient framework integrating federated Long Short-Term Memory-based photovoltaic forecasting with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection and energy management system optimization. The approach combines autoencoder reconstruction error with prediction uncertainty quantification to enable attack-resilient energy storage scheduling while preserving data privacy. Extreme false data attack conditions were studied that caused 58% forecast degradation and 16.9\% operational cost increases. The proposed integrated framework reduced false positive detections by 70%, recovered 93.7% of forecasting performance losses, and achieved 5\% operational cost savings, mitigating 34.7% of attack-induced economic losses. Results demonstrate that precision-focused cascade detection with multi-signal fusion outperforms single-signal approaches, validating security-performance synergy for decentralized microgrids.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have become powerful architectures for sequence modeling, yet their internal dynamics remain poorly understood compared to attention-based models. We introduce and validate the Influence Score, a controllability-based metric derived from the discretized state-space parameters of Mamba and computed through a backward recurrence analogous to system observability. The score quantifies how strongly a token at position k affects all later states and outputs. We evaluate this measure across three Mamba variants: mamba-130m, mamba-2.8b, and mamba-2.8b-slimpj, using six experiments that test its sensitivity to temperature, prompt complexity, token type, layer depth, token position, and input perturbations. The results show three main insights: (1) the Influence Score increases with model size and training data, reflecting model capacity; (2) Mamba exhibits consistent architectural patterns, including recency bias and concentrated influence in mid-to-late layers; and (3) emergent behaviors appear only at scale, with mamba-2.8b-slimpj uniquely prioritizing content words and reducing internal influence in the presence of noise. These findings establish the Influence Score as a practical diagnostic tool for interpreting and comparing SSM-based language models.

Abstract: Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure faces escalating cybersecurity threats that can severely compromise operational efficiency and grid stability. Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.

Abstract: Current methods for editing pre-trained models face significant challenges, primarily high computational costs and limited scalability. Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.

Motivation: 多领域图预训练虽提升图神经网络泛化性，但在成员推理攻击下的隐私风险未被充分研究，且对其进行有效攻击存在诸多挑战。

Method: 提出成员信号放大机制、增量影子模型构建机制和基于相似度的推理机制，组成 MGP - MIA 框架。

Result: 大量实验证明了 MGP - MIA 的有效性。

Conclusion: 多领域图预训练存在隐私风险。

Abstract: Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.

Abstract: We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.

Abstract: Differentially private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has become integral to privacy-preserving machine learning, ensuring robust privacy guarantees in sensitive domains. Despite notable empirical advances leveraging features from non-private, pre-trained models to enhance DP-SGD training, a theoretical understanding of feature dynamics in private learning remains underexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss. Our findings highlight the challenges of private learning and prove the benefit of feature enhancement to improve SNR. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法可在微调大语言模型时避免完全回退，实现精确、低影响的更新，有效减少有害输出并保持任务性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often compromises safety alignment, even when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦学习类不平衡场景下，无法解决推理时对动态域或分布偏移的无监督自适应问题，需要新的方法来处理。

Method: 提出pFedBBN框架，在本地客户端自适应时采用平衡批量归一化（BBN），实现客户端协作，支持全无监督本地自适应，引入类感知模型聚合策略。

Result: 在多种基线的广泛实验中，pFedBBN比现有联邦学习和测试时自适应方法持续增强了鲁棒性和少数类性能。

Conclusion: pFedBBN通过平衡特征归一化和域感知协作，能有效解决分布偏移和类不平衡问题，且无需客户端的任何标记或原始数据。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) in federated learning (FL) is crucial for handling unseen data distributions across clients, particularly when faced with domain shifts and skewed class distributions. Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在临床决策支持中与现实医学多方面推理路径对齐的挑战。

Method: 通过结合自动基准和医生盲测的双层框架，评估四种对齐策略（SFT、DPO、GRPO、ICL）。

Result: GRPO算法准确率最高，但临床医生更青睐SFT模型，SFT在盲测中胜率最高。

Conclusion: 需要优先考虑临床可解释和可行推理的对齐策略，而非仅优化决策级准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.

Abstract: Predictive control approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained significant attention in microgrid energy optimization. However, existing research often overlooks the issue of uncertainty stemming from imperfect prediction models, which can lead to suboptimal control strategies. This paper presents a new error temporal difference (ETD) algorithm for DRL to address the uncertainty in predictions,aiming to improve the performance of microgrid operations. First,a microgrid system integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), along with its Markov decision process (MDP), is modelled. Second, a predictive control approach based on a deep Q network (DQN) is presented, in which a weighted average algorithm and a new ETD algorithm are designed to quantify and address the prediction uncertainty, respectively. Finally, simulations on a realworld US dataset suggest that the developed ETD effectively improves the performance of DRL in optimizing microgrid operations.

Conclusion: 现有多模态对抗训练存在显著盲点，VARMAT方法有效提高多模态鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant superiority on various tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.

Method: 比较基于邻接矩阵的卷积神经网络（CNNs）和通过消息传递从图结构学习的图神经网络（GNNs）两种范式。

Result: 在2000个最多64个顶点的随机图上，GNNs的精度（$R^2=0.987$，MAE $=0.372$）明显高于CNNs（$R^2=0.955$，MAE $=0.500$），且GNNs比精确求解器加速超200倍。

Conclusion: GNNs可作为组合图不变量的实用替代，对可扩展图优化和数学发现有意义。

Abstract: We investigate machine learning approaches to approximating the \emph{domination number} of graphs, the minimum size of a dominating set. Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.

Conclusion: 研究成果已并入SciPy主分支，将为可微系统和机器学习中的3D空间数学提供与框架无关的生产级基础。

Abstract: Three-dimensional rigid-body transforms, i.e. rotations and translations, are central to modern differentiable machine learning pipelines in robotics, vision, and simulation. However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's spatial.transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial.transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.

Result: 在真实WiFi指纹数据集上，即使30%位置未见仍保持相同定位精度，比现有增强方法精度最高提升28%。

Conclusion: LocaGen能显著减少指纹定位开销，提升定位性能。

Abstract: Indoor localization systems commonly rely on fingerprinting, which requires extensive survey efforts to obtain location-tagged signal data, limiting their real-world deployability. Recent approaches that attempt to reduce this overhead either suffer from low representation ability, mode collapse issues, or require the effort of collecting data at all target locations. We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage. Our extensive evaluation on a real-world WiFi fingerprinting dataset shows that LocaGen maintains the same localization accuracy even with 30% of the locations unseen and achieves up to 28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation methods.

Motivation: MDMs存在训练方差高的问题，导致优化不稳定，且缺乏理论解释和系统解决方案。

Method: 将MDM训练方差分解为三种来源，设计六种降方差方法，包括核心方法P - POTS和MIRROR。

Result: 与标准MDM训练相比，方法在复杂推理任务上提高准确率7 - 8%，减少运行变异性至接近自回归模型（ARMs）水平。

Conclusion: 所设计的方法有效缩小了MDMs与强ARMs基线的差距。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs), but they suffer from inherently much higher training variance. High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.

Conclusion: 此方法有效解决发动机间差异，提高模型泛化性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of engine-out NOx is essential for meeting stringent emissions regulations and optimizing engine performance. Traditional approaches rely on models trained on data from a small number of engines, which can be insufficient in generalizing across an entire population of engines due to sensor biases and variations in input conditions. In real world applications, these models require tuning or calibration to maintain acceptable error tolerance when applied to other engines. This highlights the need for models that can adapt with minimal adjustments to accommodate engine-to-engine variability and sensor discrepancies. While previous studies have explored machine learning methods for predicting engine-out NOx, these approaches often fail to generalize reliably across different engines and operating environments. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian calibration framework that combines Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to infer and correct sensor biases. Starting with a pre-trained model developed using nominal engine data, our method identifies engine specific sensor biases and recalibrates predictions accordingly. By incorporating these inferred biases, our approach generates posterior predictive distributions for engine-out NOx on unseen test data, achieving high accuracy without retraining the model. Our results demonstrate that this transferable modeling approach significantly improves the accuracy of predictions compared to conventional non-adaptive GP models, effectively addressing engine-to-engine variability and improving model generalizability.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) by introducing the first dedicated inner-loop actor-critic framework for continuous state and action spaces: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MOMA-AC). Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.

Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller "draft" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger "target" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中不确定性估计很重要，但深度神经网络缺乏校准的不确定性估计。

Method: 引入GPPO算法，利用Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs)近似策略和价值函数。

Result: 在标准高维连续控制基准测试中，GPPO与Proximal Policy Optimization表现相当，并能提供校准的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: GPPO可实现更安全有效的探索。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a critical component in control tasks where agents must balance safe exploration and efficient learning. While deep neural networks have enabled breakthroughs in RL, they often lack calibrated uncertainty estimates. We introduce Deep Gaussian Process Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO), a scalable, model-free actor-critic algorithm that leverages Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) to approximate both the policy and value function. GPPO maintains competitive performance with respect to Proximal Policy Optimization on standard high-dimensional continuous control benchmarks while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that can inform safer and more effective exploration.

Conclusion: 研究结果为情景强化学习中的标准乐观算法提供了首批综合尾遗憾保证之一。

Abstract: We derive instance-dependent tail bounds for the regret of optimism-based reinforcement learning in finite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes with unknown transition dynamics. Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\Pr(R_K \ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $α$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide one of the first comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for a standard optimistic algorithm in episodic reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: CausalTraj模型在多智能体轨迹联合预测方面表现出色，联合指标能更好评估集体建模能力。

Abstract: Jointly forecasting trajectories of multiple interacting agents is a core challenge in sports analytics and other domains involving complex group dynamics. Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.

Conclusion: RB - DeepONet是用于大规模参数化PDE的高效、稳定且可解释的算子学习器。

Abstract: Parametric PDEs power modern simulation, design, and digital-twin systems, yet their many-query workloads still hinge on repeatedly solving large finite-element systems. Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效解决大型网络公平资源替代问题，具有良好的计算效果。

Abstract: Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.

Abstract: Task-agnostic tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have achieved impressive performance on tabular learning tasks, yet the origins of their inductive biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: TRIDENT通过明确建模转录组 - 表型组映射，提供强大的计算机模拟工具，推动预测性虚拟细胞的发展。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.

Abstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.

Motivation: 传统芯片设计验证方法存在时间和计算资源消耗大的问题，且缺乏综合考虑芯片设计领域知识、图论和GPU内核设计的联合框架。

Method: 创建节点特征，利用图划分和图边再生算法，针对EDA图工作负载特点重新设计两个GPU内核。

Result: GROOT在内存占用上显著降低（59.38%），准确率高（99.96%），运行时间相比其他SOTA方法有不同程度提升。

Conclusion: GROOT框架能有效提高芯片设计验证效率。

Abstract: Traditional verification methods in chip design are highly time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially for large scale circuits. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor. We achieve up to 1.104x, 5.796x, and 1.469x improvement in runtime, respectively.

Abstract: We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.

Conclusion: DiM - TS是高质量时间序列生成模型，能更好保留时间周期性和通道间相关性。

Abstract: Time series data plays a pivotal role in a wide variety of fields but faces challenges related to privacy concerns. Recently, synthesizing data via diffusion models is viewed as a promising solution. However, existing methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations. In this research, we aim to utilize the sequence modeling capability of a State Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to time series data generation. We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process. Theoretical analysis reveals that both variants exhibit a unified matrix multiplication framework with the original Mamba, offering a deeper understanding of our method. Finally, we integrate two variants and introduce Diffusion Mamba for Time Series (DiM-TS), a high-quality time series generation model that better preserves the temporal periodicity and inter-channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiM-TS in generating realistic time series while preserving diverse properties of data.

Conclusion: 细粒度、基于重要性的专家分配显著增强多模态MoE模型效率和效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.

Abstract: Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions ("I don't know") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.

Conclusion: 利用被忽略基因的AGL方法和DkGSB基因选择方法有效，能提升性能。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.

Result: 预测能力高度可变，取决于提问内容和方式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的预测能力受提问因素显著影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate partial forecasting competence across social, political, and economic events. Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply with domain structure and prompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with different model families on real-world questions about events that happened beyond the model cutoff date. We analyze how context, question type, and external knowledge affect accuracy and calibration, and how adding factual news context modifies belief formation and failure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask.

Conclusion: MVCIB是有效的多视图分子图预训练方法，能提升模型性能和表达能力。

Abstract: Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.

Result: 证明了一般情况下的等变通用逼近定理，为不同实例系统地推导通用逼近定理。

Conclusion: 类别等变深度学习能超越群作用拓展等变深度学习，涵盖多种对称。

Abstract: We develop a theory of category-equivariant neural networks (CENNs) that unifies group/groupoid-equivariant networks, poset/lattice-equivariant networks, graph and sheaf neural networks. Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.

Conclusion: 得到一个简单、可重复的管道，适合临床应用和外部验证。

Abstract: We study an ultrasound-first, radiation-preserving policy for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that requests a radiograph only when needed.
  We (i) pretrain modality-specific encoders (ResNet-18) with SimSiam on a large unlabelled registry (37186 ultrasound; 19546 radiographs), (ii) freeze the backbones and fit small, measurement-faithful heads on DDH relevant landmarks and measurements (iii) calibrate a one sided conformal deferral rule on ultrasound predictions that provides finite sample coverage guarantees under exchangeability, using a held-out calibration set. Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs. The result is a simple, reproducible pipeline that turns limited labels into interpretable measurements and tunable selective imaging curves suitable for clinical handoff and future external validation.

Result: SloMo - Fast在Cyclic - TTA及其他十个CTTA设置中始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SloMo - Fast能在不断演变和重访的领域中有效适应和泛化。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is crucial for deploying models in real-world applications with unseen, evolving target domains. Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应网格量化框架能有效优化计算资源利用，提升求解性能。

Abstract: Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.

Motivation: 传统PINNs最小化平均残差会隐藏大的局部误差，需要改进。

Method: 提出RRaPINNs框架，用CVaR优化尾聚焦目标，引入ME替代惩罚控制最坏情况PDE残差。

Result: 在多个PDE上，RRaPINNs减少尾残差，保持或改善平均误差，ME替代惩罚优化更平滑，机会约束可靠性水平可平衡整体精度和尾部控制。

Conclusion: RRaPINNs为连续和不连续PDE的可靠性感知科学机器学习提供实用途径。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) typically minimize average residuals, which can conceal large, localized errors. We propose Residual Risk-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs (RRaPINNs), a single-network framework that optimizes tail-focused objectives using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we also introduced a Mean-Excess (ME) surrogate penalty to directly control worst-case PDE residuals. This casts PINN training as risk-sensitive optimization and links it to chance-constrained formulations. The method is effective and simple to implement. Across several partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Burgers, Heat, Korteweg-de-Vries, and Poisson (including a Poisson interface problem with a source jump at x=0.5) equations, RRaPINNs reduce tail residuals while maintaining or improving mean errors compared to vanilla PINNs, Residual-Based Attention and its variant using convolution weighting; the ME surrogate yields smoother optimization than a direct CVaR hinge. The chance constraint reliability level $α$ acts as a transparent knob trading bulk accuracy (lower $α$ ) for stricter tail control (higher $α$ ). We discuss the framework limitations, including memoryless sampling, global-only tail budgeting, and residual-centric risk, and outline remedies via persistent hard-point replay, local risk budgets, and multi-objective risk over BC/IC terms. RRaPINNs offer a practical path to reliability-aware scientific ML for both smooth and discontinuous PDEs.

Motivation: 在CLIP适配垂直领域过程中，数据因素未被充分探索，探究有效数据选择能否替代大规模数据集。

Method: 提出CHIPS方法，为每个图像 - 文本对分配效用分数，综合三个互补因素，并从理论上证明设计合理性。

Result: 在17个医学基准测试中达SOTA，用30%数据可匹配全量数据CPT效果，10%数据超半量数据CPT；在31个通用领域基准测试中，在10 - 30%数据保留预算下性能下降最小。

Conclusion: 有效数据选择在CLIP适配垂直领域中可替代大规模数据集，CHIPS方法有效。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP to vertical domains is typically approached by novel fine-tuning strategies or by continual pre-training (CPT) on large domain-specific datasets. Yet, data itself remains an underexplored factor in this process. We revisit this task from a data-centric perspective: Can effective data selection substitute for large-scale datasets in CPT? We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets. Code, data, and checkpoints will be released.

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAE）对NASA的TEMPO卫星高光谱观测数据进行压缩，并训练线性和非线性探测器从压缩的潜在空间中提取二级产品。

Conclusion: 神经压缩可大幅减少高光谱数据量并保留关键大气信号，解决下一代地球观测系统的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Geostationary hyperspectral satellites generate terabytes of data daily, creating critical challenges for storage, transmission, and distribution to the scientific community. We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

Result: 在六个基准数据集上实验，TimePre在关键概率指标上达到新的最优准确率，推理速度比基于采样模型快多个数量级，性能稳定可扩展。

Conclusion: TimePre弥合了概率预测中准确率、效率和稳定性之间的长期差距。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.

Motivation: Forward - Forward算法的有效性依赖于‘goodness’的定义，但当前默认的平方和度量不一定是最优的，因此需要进行评估。

Method: 在四个标准图像数据集上对21种不同的‘goodness’函数进行基准测试，评估分类准确率、能耗和碳足迹。

Result: 部分替代‘goodness’函数表现显著优于标准基线，不同函数计算效率有显著差异。

Conclusion: ‘goodness’函数是Forward - Forward算法设计中的关键超参数。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, enabling neural networks to learn through local updates. However, FF's efficacy relies heavily on the definition of "goodness", which is a scalar measure of neural activity. While current implementations predominantly utilize a simple sum-of-squares metric, it remains unclear if this default choice is optimal. To address this, we benchmarked 21 distinct goodness functions across four standard image datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10), evaluating classification accuracy, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. We found that certain alternative goodness functions inspired from various domains significantly outperform the standard baseline. Specifically, \texttt{game\_theoretic\_local} achieved 97.15\% accuracy on MNIST, \texttt{softmax\_energy\_margin\_local} reached 82.84\% on FashionMNIST, and \texttt{triplet\_margin\_local} attained 37.69\% on STL-10. Furthermore, we observed substantial variability in computational efficiency, highlighting a critical trade-off between predictive performance and environmental cost. These findings demonstrate that the goodness function is a pivotal hyperparameter in FF design. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/aryashah2k/In-Search-of-Goodness}{Github} for reference and reproducibility.

Result: 在十三个EEG数据集实验中，SAMBA性能超现有方法，内存消耗和推理时间低，学习的空间权重图与神经生理区域匹配。

Conclusion: SAMBA可扩展性强，有作为实时脑机接口应用基础模型的实际潜力。

Abstract: Long-sequence electroencephalogram (EEG) modeling is essential for developing generalizable EEG representation models. This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA. These results highlight SAMBA's scalability and practical potential as a foundation model for real-time brain-computer interface applications.

Conclusion: 谱加权扩散方法能有效解决图扩散模型的生成近视问题。

Abstract: Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).

Result: LSTM在所有测试的预测范围内表现出显著优势，标准KAN误差率高、实际适用性有限，KAN在资源受限、精度要求不高时有计算效率优势。

Conclusion: 支持在实际金融预测中采用LSTM，建议继续研究专门的KAN架构以取得改进。

Abstract: This paper compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for forecasting non-deterministic stock price data, evaluating predictive accuracy versus interpretability trade-offs using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).LSTM demonstrates substantial superiority across all tested prediction horizons, confirming their established effectiveness for sequential data modelling. Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent. The findings support LSTM adoption for practical financial forecasting while suggesting that continued research into specialised KAN architectures may yield future improvements.

Abstract: Interdisciplinary scientific breakthroughs mostly emerge unexpectedly, and forecasting the formation of novel research fields remains a major challenge. We introduce FOS (Future Of Science), a comprehensive time-aware graph-based benchmark that reconstructs annual co-occurrence graphs of 65,027 research sub-fields (spanning 19 general domains) over the period 1827-2024. In these graphs, edges denote the co-occurrence of two fields in a single publication and are timestamped with the corresponding publication year. Nodes are enriched with semantic embeddings, and edges are characterized by temporal and topological descriptors. We formulate the prediction of new field-pair linkages as a temporal link-prediction task, emphasizing the "first-time" connections that signify pioneering interdisciplinary directions. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art temporal graph architectures under multiple negative-sampling regimes and show that (i) embedding long-form textual descriptions of fields significantly boosts prediction accuracy, and (ii) distinct model classes excel under different evaluation settings. Case analyses show that top-ranked link predictions on FOS align with field pairings that emerge in subsequent years of academic publications. We publicly release FOS, along with its temporal data splits and evaluation code, to establish a reproducible benchmark for advancing research in predicting scientific frontiers.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了本地可部署的虚拟医生框架MedChat，用于临床问诊，展示了其可行性和优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型进展使临床现场部署成为可能，但医学中安全实施需考虑多方面约束，因此开发本地可部署框架。

Method: 引入MedChat框架，用混合语料微调聊天机器人，通过低秩适应优化效率，实现安全数据库接口，用条件扩散模型实现头像组件。

Result: 自编码器和扩散网络收敛平滑，MedChat微调稳定，对未见数据泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MedChat为AI辅助临床问诊提供隐私保护、资源高效的基础，在低成本环境也适用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models made it possible to achieve high conversational performance with substantially reduced computational demands, enabling practical on-site deployment in clinical environments. Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints.
  In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation.
  Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.

TL;DR: 提出混合精度KV缓存算法Kitty，可将KV内存减少近8倍，精度损失可忽略不计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2位KV量化在长上下文推理中精度下降问题，缩小其与4位量化精度差距。

Method: 采用算法 - 系统协同设计，算法上使用动态通道精度提升方法，系统上分解混合精度键页为统一2位精度张量，提供页面中心KV布局、Triton兼容页面反量化内核和轻量级运行时管道。

Result: 在七个任务和两个模型系列中，将KV内存减少近8倍，精度损失可忽略，使批量增大8倍，吞吐量提高2.1 - 4.1倍。

Conclusion: Kitty有效解决KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，在减少内存使用同时保持高精度，提高推理效率。

Abstract: The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.

Motivation: 解决预训练模型模块替换时冷启动重新初始化使冻结主干不稳定的优化难题。

Method: 提出Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR)方法，用确定性退火权重混合教师和学生输出。

Result: 在单种子研究中，DCR在受控注意力替换上比随机门控和蒸馏基线收敛更快、对齐性更强。

Conclusion: DCR为异构算子交换奠定基础。

Abstract: Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.

Result: 分析和实验表明MCEM在连续和离散动作基准测试中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCEM能有效克服集中 - 分散不匹配问题，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), where centralized critics leverage global information to guide decentralized actors. However, centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) arises when the suboptimal behavior of one agent degrades others' learning. Prior approaches mitigate CDM through value decomposition, but linear decompositions allow per-agent gradients at the cost of limited expressiveness, while nonlinear decompositions improve representation but require centralized gradients, reintroducing CDM. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD). MCEM updates policies by increasing the probability of high-value joint actions, thereby excluding suboptimal behaviors. For sample efficiency, we extend off-policy learning with a modified k-step return and Retrace. Analysis and experiments demonstrate that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both continuous and discrete action benchmarks.

Motivation: KANs虽有优势，但异质参数阻碍高效量化，此方面研究不足。

Method: 提出QuantKAN框架，将现代量化算法扩展到基于样条的层，使用特定分支量化器。

Result: 在多数据集和KAN变体上实验，得出不同方法在不同模型和量化场景下的表现。

Conclusion: QuantKAN框架统一了样条学习和量化，为KANs在资源受限环境部署提供工具和指导。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a new class of neural architectures that replace conventional linear transformations and node-based nonlinearities with spline-based function approximations distributed along network edges. Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST. Our proposed QuantKAN framework thus unifies spline learning and quantization, and provides practical tools and guidelines for efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

Result: GRIT - LP在均方根误差上比现有最先进方法提高24.92%。

Conclusion: 图变换器能通过捕捉局部结构特征和长距离依赖有效建模时空模式，有推动冰冻圈过程数据驱动理解的潜力。

Abstract: Graph transformers have demonstrated remarkable capability on complex spatio-temporal tasks, yet their depth is often limited by oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.

Result: 提供了更可信和实用的安全证书，为从业者提供可操作的安全保证。

Conclusion: 该工作为使大语言模型更抗安全对齐漏洞利用提供了实用且有理论依据的机制。

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

Abstract: The transition to autonomous material systems necessitates adaptive control methodologies to maximize structural longevity. This study frames the self-healing process as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem within a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling agents to autonomously derive optimal policies that efficiently balance structural integrity maintenance against finite resource consumption. A comparative evaluation of discrete-action (Q-learning, DQN) and continuous-action (TD3) agents in a stochastic simulation environment revealed that RL controllers significantly outperform heuristic baselines, achieving near-complete material recovery. Crucially, the TD3 agent utilizing continuous dosage control demonstrated superior convergence speed and stability, underscoring the necessity of fine-grained, proportional actuation in dynamic self-healing applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的轴向变压器设计实验表现良好，模型能有效完成动作总数预测。

Abstract: Football (soccer) is a sport that is characterised by complex game play, where players perform a variety of actions, such as passes, shots, tackles, fouls, in order to score goals, and ultimately win matches. Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step. We present a novel axial transformer design that we show is equivalent to a regular sequential transformer, and the design performs well experimentally. We show empirically that the model can make consistent and reliable predictions, and efficiently makes $\sim$75,000 live predictions at low latency for each game.

Conclusion: 通过集成局部感知和全局频谱表示，Spectral Attention Operator Transformer框架在解决偏微分方程方面具有良好效果。

Abstract: Neural operators have shown great potential in solving a family of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by modeling the mappings between input and output functions. Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implements global convolutions via parameterizing the integral operators in Fourier space. However, it often results in over-smoothing solutions and fails to capture local details and high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we investigate incorporating the spatial-frequency localization property of Wavelet transforms into the Transformer architecture. We propose a novel Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity to efficiently learn locality-aware features. Building upon WA, we further develop the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), a hybrid spectral Transformer framework that integrates WA's localized focus with the global receptive field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) through a gated fusion block. Experimental results demonstrate that WA significantly mitigates the limitations of FA and outperforms existing Wavelet-based neural operators by a large margin. By integrating the locality-aware and global spectral representations, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six operator learning benchmarks and exhibits strong discretization-invariant ability.

Abstract: Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Abstract: Heart rate estimation from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals generated by wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers has significant implications for the health and well-being of individuals. Although prior work has demonstrated deep learning models with strong performance in the heart rate estimation task, in order to deploy these models on wearable devices, these models must also adhere to strict memory and latency constraints. In this work, we explore and characterize how large pre-trained PPG models may be distilled to smaller models appropriate for real-time inference on the edge. We evaluate four distillation strategies through comprehensive sweeps of teacher and student model capacities: (1) hard distillation, (2) soft distillation, (3) decoupled knowledge distillation (DKD), and (4) feature distillation. We present a characterization of the resulting scaling laws describing the relationship between model size and performance. This early investigation lays the groundwork for practical and predictable methods for building edge-deployable models for physiological sensing.

Conclusion: 显式时间编码有益，所提设计为现实世界PPM应用提供了灵活且强大的方案。

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) struggle with temporal irregularities, particularly stochastic event durations and overlapping timestamps, limiting their adaptability across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations. This design is implemented across two baseline families: B-LSTM and B-GCN, and their duration-aware variants D-LSTM and D-GCN. All models incorporate self-tuned hypermodels for adaptive architecture selection. Experiments on balanced and imbalanced outcome prediction tasks show that duration pseudo-embedding inputs consistently improve generalization, reduce model complexity, and enhance interpretability. Our results demonstrate the benefits of explicit temporal encoding and provide a flexible design for robust, real-world PPM applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces HGNN(O), an AutoML GNN hypermodel framework for outcome prediction on event-sequence data. Building on our earlier work on graph convolutional network hypermodels, HGNN(O) extends four architectures-One Level, Two Level, Two Level Pseudo Embedding, and Two Level Embedding-across six canonical GNN operators. A self-tuning mechanism based on Bayesian optimization with pruning and early stopping enables efficient adaptation over architectures and hyperparameters without manual configuration. Empirical evaluation on both balanced and imbalanced event logs shows that HGNN(O) achieves accuracy exceeding 0.98 on the Traffic Fines dataset and weighted F1 scores up to 0.86 on the Patients dataset without explicit imbalance handling. These results demonstrate that the proposed AutoML-GNN approach provides a robust and generalizable benchmark for outcome prediction in complex event-sequence data.

Abstract: Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.

Conclusion: KernelBand是一种有效的大语言模型内核优化框架，能在优化空间中高效探索与利用，提升性能。

Abstract: High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.

Result: 在NPU平台的强化学习训练中整体性能至少提升三倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.

Conclusion: Hi - SAFE能解决基于符号的联邦学习在隐私和通信效率方面的局限。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks. While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n.

Conclusion: 通过确定关键架构因素、采用多种方法，显著提升了SLMs的准确率 - 效率前沿。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.

Conclusion: VADE可解决梯度消失问题，能作为即插即用组件集成到现有基于组的强化学习算法中。

Abstract: Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VADE}, a \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms. Code and models are available at https://VADE-RL.github.io.

Result: 结合两种策略，在标准基准测试中平均得分比随机混洗提高1.64%，在不同数据质量指标的模型上验证有效。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估基于课程的大语言模型预训练，强调数据课程与优化方法协同设计的潜力。

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a lightweight architecture for learning solution operators for parametric PDEs by directly approximating the kernel integral using a Monte Carlo approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators, MCNO makes no spectral or translation-invariance assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over a fixed set of randomly sampled points. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with low computational cost, providing a simple and practical alternative to spectral and graph-based neural operators.

Conclusion: SWAN无分解压缩设计、压缩下高性能且适应性强，是服务长上下文大语言模型的实用高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.

Conclusion: 该框架具有灵活性和效率，可生成可训练、完全可微的估计器，能嵌入更大学习管道，通过归一化流可适应任意数据模态。

Abstract: We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.

Conclusion: Cutter能显著提高评估效率且不影响评估准确性。

Abstract: As graph-structured data grow increasingly large, evaluating their robustness under adversarial attacks becomes computationally expensive and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.

Conclusion: AVA - VLA框架能有效解决现有VLA模型的局限性，具有良好的性能和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.

Conclusion: FastForward Pruning在搜索效率上有明显优势。

Abstract: Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.

Abstract: The challenge of building neural networks that can continuously learn and adapt to evolving data streams is central to the fields of continual learning (CL) and reinforcement learning (RL).

Unlike neural networks, biological brains maintain plasticity through capacity growth, inspiring researchers to explore similar approaches in artificial networks, such as adding capacity dynamically. Prior solutions often lack parameter efficiency or depend on explicit task indices, but Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising alternative by specializing experts for distinct distributions. This paper aims to evaluate a DynamicMoE approach for continual and reinforcement learning environments and benchmark its effectiveness against existing network expansion methods.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) are rapidly expanding with the growing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.

Conclusion: OrdMoE 无需人工标注偏好数据，能有效提升多模态混合专家大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.

Result: 该编码从恒定数量的观测中实现节点可识别性，在药物相互作用任务上提升了ROC曲线下面积和F1分数。

Conclusion: 利用原则性位置信息解决理论表达能力限制有实际好处。

Abstract: Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.

Conclusion: 提出的ACE和ACED方法能有效应对异步联邦学习中的问题。

Abstract: In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.

Conclusion: 轨迹级分析为理解生成难度和样本特征提供了受物理学启发且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models synthesize data by integrating a learned velocity field from a reference distribution to the target data distribution. Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.

Abstract: The advent of financial technology has witnessed a surge in the utilization of deep learning models to anticipate consumer conduct, a trend that has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing lending strategies and bolstering market efficiency. We study multi-horizon demand forecasting on e-commerce transactions using the UCI Online Retail II dataset. Unlike prior versions of this manuscript that mixed financial-loan narratives with retail data, we focus exclusively on retail market behavior and define a clear prediction target: per SKU daily demand (or revenue) for horizons H=1,7,14. We present a hybrid sequence model that combines multi-scale temporal convolutions, a gated recurrent module, and time-aware self-attention. The model is trained with standard regression losses and evaluated under MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE, and Theil's U_2 with strict time-based splits to prevent leakage. We benchmark against ARIMA/Prophet, LSTM/GRU, LightGBM, and state-of-the-art Transformer forecasters (TFT, Informer, Autoformer, N-BEATS). Results show consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness on peak/holiday periods. We further provide ablations and statistical significance tests to ensure the reliability of improvements, and we release implementation details to facilitate reproducibility.

Result: 有效减少通信开销，有提升能效的潜力，支持跨站点泛化。

Conclusion: 该解决方案可扩展、节能，适合优化远程和带宽受限的物联网环境中的传感器数据传输。

Abstract: The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.

Conclusion: 该框架在RUL预测及不确定性量化方面表现出色，为安全关键预测建立了新基准，可实现风险感知的维护调度。

Abstract: Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.

Result: 该原则可融入现有算法，如Q学习或演员-评论家方法。

Conclusion: 可能带来更快的评价收敛和更稳定的策略梯度，且不改变算法整体结构。

Abstract: We propose a refinement of temporal-difference learning that enforces first-order Bellman consistency: the learned value function is trained to match not only the Bellman targets in value but also their derivatives with respect to states and actions. By differentiating the Bellman backup through differentiable dynamics, we obtain analytically consistent gradient targets. Incorporating these into the critic objective using a Sobolev-type loss encourages the critic to align with both the value and local geometry of the target function. This first-order TD matching principle can be seamlessly integrated into existing algorithms, such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods (e.g., DDPG, SAC), potentially leading to faster critic convergence and more stable policy gradients without altering their overall structure.

Conclusion: RAVEN++能有效提升视频广告审核的细粒度理解、推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Advertising (Ad) is a cornerstone of the digital economy, yet the moderation of video advertisements remains a significant challenge due to their complexity and the need for precise violation localization. While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.

Result: 配置良好的滑动窗口机制（SW - UCB）很稳健，广泛使用的折扣方法（D - UCB）存在学习失败问题，导致线性遗憾；采用乐观聚合策略的FDSW - UCB在动态环境中性能更优。

Conclusion: 集成策略是算法在动态环境中成功的决定性因素。

Abstract: Many real-world bandit problems involve non-stationary reward distributions, where the optimal decision may shift due to evolving environments. However, the performance of some typical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms degrades significantly in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time. To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that a well-configured sliding-window mechanism (SW-UCB) is robust, while the widely used discounting method (D-UCB) suffers from a fundamental learning failure, leading to linear regret. Crucially, the proposed FDSW-UCB, when employing an optimistic aggregation strategy, achieves superior performance in dynamic settings, highlighting that the ensemble strategy itself is a decisive factor for success.

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为合作多智能体强化学习训练的有效高级设计师。

Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.

We present a Nutrition Photoplethysmography Language Model (NPLM), integrating continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) from wearables with meal descriptions. NPLM projects PPG into embeddings interpretable by language models, enabling joint reasoning over physiology and meal context. Trained on 19,340 participants and 1.1 million meal-PPG pairs, the model improved daily caloric intake prediction by 11% over text-only baselines, with accuracy maintained when 80% of meal text was removed. In an independent validation study (n=140) with controlled dining and detailed meal information, the model replicated these findings. These results demonstrate the value of integrating physiological measurements from consumer wearables with meal information for noninvasive dietary monitoring at scale.

Conclusion: 集成几何和文本信息为功率转换效率预测提供了更强大准确的框架。

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks, or GFlowNets, offer a promising framework for molecular design, but their internal decision policies remain opaque. This limits adoption in drug discovery, where chemists require clear and interpretable rationales for proposed structures. We present an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet trained on documented chemical reactions and purchasable starting materials that generates both molecules and the synthetic routes that produce them. Our approach integrates three complementary components. Gradient based saliency combined with counterfactual perturbations identifies which atomic environments influence reward and how structural edits change molecular outcomes. Sparse autoencoders reveal axis aligned latent factors that correspond to physicochemical properties such as polarity, lipophilicity, and molecular size. Motif probes show that functional groups including aromatic rings and halogens are explicitly encoded and linearly decodable from the internal embeddings. Together, these results expose the chemical logic inside SynFlowNet and provide actionable and mechanistic insight that supports transparent and controllable molecular design.

With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 评估时空图神经网络（GNNs）在多门店零售销售预测中的有效性，并与ARIMA、LSTM和XGBoost等基线模型进行性能比较。

Method: 使用45家沃尔玛门店的周销售数据，构建一个通过学习自适应图来建模门店间依赖关系的关系预测框架，STGNN预测对数差分销售并通过残差路径重建最终值。

Result: STGNN实现了最低的总体预测误差，在归一化总绝对误差、P90 MAPE和各门店MAPE方差方面均优于所有基线模型，学习到的邻接矩阵显示出有意义的功能门店集群和高影响节点。

Conclusion: 关系结构显著提高了相互关联的零售环境中的预测质量，STGNN是多门店需求预测的可靠建模选择。

Abstract: This work evaluates the effectiveness of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-store retail sales forecasting and compares their performance against ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost baselines. Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata. These results demonstrate that relational structure significantly improves forecast quality in interconnected retail environments and establishes STGNNs as a robust modelling choice for multi-store demand prediction.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks.

Result: Tiny - TSM在多种时间序列基准数据集上达最优，在中长预测任务MSE损失下超其他模型，短期精度有竞争力；因果输入归一化方案加速收敛、减少训练时间。

Conclusion: 所提方法在资源受限环境实用。

Abstract: We present Tiny-TSM, a time series foundation model characterized by small scale, economical training, and state-of-the-art performance. It comprises 23M total parameters, trained on a single A100 GPU in less than a week using a new synthetic data generation and data augmentation pipeline (SynthTS). Without any neural architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, or scaling up model size, Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of time series benchmark datasets, often outperforming much larger models and even matching the performance of much larger, industrial-scale, likely highly tuned foundation models. Specifically, Tiny-TSM outperforms all other time series foundation models we evaluated on medium- and long-term forecasting tasks under MSE loss, while short-term accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art models.
  We also introduce a causal input normalization scheme that enables time series models to be trained with dense next-token prediction loss, significantly accelerating convergence speed and reducing training time.
  All experiments were conducted on a single A100 GPU, illustrating the practicality of the proposed approach in a resource-constrained setting.

Result: 与多种先进方法对比，在bnlearn仓库的分类数据集上，该方法减少计算复杂度且在因果发现中保持有竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提基于TM的方法是传统PC算法实现的可行替代方案，提高效率且不影响性能。

Abstract: The PC algorithm is a widely used method in causal inference for learning the structure of Bayesian networks. Despite its popularity, the PC algorithm suffers from significant time complexity, particularly as the size of the dataset increases, which limits its applicability in large-scale real-world problems. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilises the Tsetlin Machine (TM) to construct Bayesian structures more efficiently. Our method leverages the most significant literals extracted from the TM and performs conditional independence (CI) tests on these selected literals instead of the full set of variables, resulting in a considerable reduction in computational time. We implemented our approach and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluation includes categorical datasets from the bnlearn repository, such as Munin1, Hepar2. The findings indicate that the proposed TM-based method not only reduces computational complexity but also maintains competitive accuracy in causal discovery, making it a viable alternative to traditional PC algorithm implementations by offering improved efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Global greenhouse gas emissions estimates are essential for monitoring and mitigation planning. Yet most datasets lack one or more characteristics that enhance their actionability, such as accuracy, global coverage, high spatial and temporal resolution, and frequent updates. To address these gaps, we present Climate TRACE (climatetrace.org), an open-access platform delivering global emissions estimates with enhanced detail, coverage, and timeliness. Climate TRACE synthesizes existing emissions data, prioritizing accuracy, coverage, and resolution, and fills gaps using sector-specific estimation approaches. The dataset is the first to provide globally comprehensive emissions estimates for individual sources (e.g., individual power plants) for all anthropogenic emitting sectors. The dataset spans January 1, 2021, to the present, with a two-month reporting lag and monthly updates. The open-access platform enables non-technical audiences to engage with detailed emissions datasets for most subnational governments worldwide. Climate TRACE supports data-driven climate action at scales where decisions are made, representing a major breakthrough for emissions accounting and mitigation.

Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏人类和动物认知地图的OOD泛化能力，需开发新架构弥补差距。

Method: 引入MapFormers架构，通过输入依赖矩阵更新Transformer位置编码，开发统一绝对和相对位置编码的两个变体以建模情景记忆和工作记忆。

Result: 在多个任务中测试，模型能学习底层空间认知地图，实现近乎完美的OOD泛化。

Conclusion: 设计用于学习认知地图的模型具有优越性，引入结构偏差实现结构 - 内容解耦很重要，MapFormers在神经科学和AI领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: A cognitive map is an internal model which encodes the abstract relationships among entities in the world, giving humans and animals the flexibility to adapt to new situations, with a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization that current AI systems still do not possess. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.

Result: 微调模型在未见病毒序列上困惑度降低，能识别SARS - CoV - 2免疫逃逸变体。

Conclusion: 数据排除可能被微调方法绕过，需要gLMs安全框架及进一步评估和缓解措施。

Abstract: Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.

Conclusion: 研究为理解transformer模型学习潜在结构提供新见解，呈现能力在训练中的演变细节。

Abstract: While transformers can discover latent structure from context, the dynamics of how they acquire different components of the latent structure remain poorly understood. In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.

Conclusion: 机器学习安全研究不应只关注模型安全，还需保障整个流程安全。

Abstract: A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.

Result: 在四个数据集上，CrossWorld - CL超越CLIP基线以及现有持续和无标注学习方法。

Conclusion: 外部世界知识对无标注持续学习有益。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in continual learning ranging from architectural novelty to clever strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting most existing methods rest on a strong but unrealistic assumption the availability of labeled data throughout the learning process. In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning.

Conclusion: 所提谱估计器和凝聚比在短文本数据无监督组织和评估中有实用价值。

Abstract: Clustering short text embeddings is a foundational task in natural language processing, yet remains challenging due to the need to specify the number of clusters in advance. We introduce a scalable spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy. This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data. Implementation of our estimator of k and Cohesion Ratio, along with code for reproducing the experiments, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/towards_clustering-0C2E.

Abstract: The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.

Conclusion: 提出的基于类别相似性的方法是一种广泛适用的工具，可提升任何数据集上的CP方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful statistical framework for high-stakes classification applications. Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods.

Abstract: Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications. While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.

### [319] [Efficiency vs. Fidelity: A Comparative Analysis of Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Flow Matching on Low-Resource Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19379)
*Srishti Gupta,Yashasvee Taiwade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对比DDPM和Flow Matching，发现Flow Matching在效率和几何特性上优于DDPM，适合实时、资源受限的生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDPM在推理时计算开销大，阻碍其部署，需对比其与新兴的Flow Matching范式。

Method: 在共享的Time - Conditioned U - Net骨干上使用MNIST数据集实现两种框架，进行几何和效率分析、数值敏感性分析。

Result: Flow Matching效率显著优于Diffusion；Flow Matching学习到接近最优的传输路径，而Diffusion轨迹随机曲折；在N = 10次函数评估时，Flow Matching保真度高，Diffusion崩溃；学习的向量场足够线性，轻量级Euler求解器适用。

Conclusion: Flow Matching是实时、资源受限生成任务的更优算法选择。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have established a new state-of-the-art in generative image synthesis, yet their deployment is hindered by significant computational overhead during inference, often requiring up to 1,000 iterative steps. This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}

Abstract: As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.

Abstract: Fantasy football leagues involve strategic player trades to optimize team performance. However, identifying optimal trades is complex due to varying player projections, positional needs, and league-specific scoring. Existing approaches focus on team selection or lineup optimization, but automated trade generation remains underexplored. In this paper, an algorithm that generates optimal trades, biasing toward improved playoff performance while maintaining apparent fairness for negotiation is explored. We introduce a genetic algorithm for fantasy football trade optimization, building on existing frameworks for team selection and lineup generation. The algorithm initializes with single-player trades, evolves through custom mutations (add/remove players, combine trades, exchange players, add from other trades, and spawn new trades), and uses team-specific elitism to preserve diversity. The cost function incorporates a playoff-weighted gain for the user's team (while maintaining apparent fairness), opponent gain, and fairness penalty. Integration with ESPN data sources enables real-time projections for all positions, including kickers and defenses. On a 12-team ESPN league (Week 8, 2025), the algorithm generated trades that upgraded the projected point totals of both the trade initiator and trade partner by nearly 3 fantasy points per week ensuring positive gains for both teams. The algorithm demonstrates effective trade optimization, with potential extensions to other fantasy sports or combinatorial problems requiring temporal biasing. Open-source implementation enables practical use and further research.

Abstract: This paper presents a gate-level Boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural network that models images as Boolean fields governed by logic gates. Each pixel is a Boolean variable (0 or 1) embedded on a two-dimensional geometric manifold (for example, a discrete toroidal lattice), which defines adjacency and information propagation among pixels. The network updates image states through a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism: pixels receive Boolean diffusion from neighboring pixels (diffusion process) and perform local logic updates via trainable gate-level logic kernels (reaction process), forming a reaction-diffusion logic network.
  A Boolean self-attention mechanism is introduced, using XNOR-based Boolean Query-Key (Q-K) attention to modulate neighborhood diffusion pathways and realize logic attention. We also propose Boolean Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative distances by parity-bit flipping to simulate Boolean ``phase'' offsets.
  The overall structure resembles a Transformer but operates entirely in the Boolean domain. Trainable parameters include Q-K pattern bits and gate-level kernel configurations. Because outputs are discrete, continuous relaxation methods (such as sigmoid approximation or soft-logic operators) ensure differentiable training.
  Theoretical analysis shows that the network achieves universal expressivity, interpretability, and hardware efficiency, capable of reproducing convolutional and attention mechanisms. Applications include high-speed image processing, interpretable artificial intelligence, and digital hardware acceleration, offering promising future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原论文对两种优化算法零偏差的宣称被指夸大，从概率角度研究偏差来源

Method: 从概率角度研究两种算法偏差来源

Result: 指数、三角函数和随机数间除法运算导致概率密度分布偏向零，造成设计缺陷

Conclusion: 应用这两种算法时应谨慎

Abstract: In the article (Kudela, 2022), experimental demonstrations indicated that two Bio-/Nature inspired optimization algorithms (BNIOAs), Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA) and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), exhibit a zero-bias, leading to the conclusion that the claims made in the original papers were overstated. In this work, we extend the analysis by investigating the source of this bias from a probabilistic perspective. Our findings suggest that operations involving exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and divisions between random numbers are the primary causes of design flaws. These operations result in probability density distributions with a noticeable shift toward zero. Therefore, the application of these two algorithms should be approached with due caution.

Abstract: The proliferation of metaphor-based metaheuristics has often been accompanied by issues of symbolic inflation, benchmarking opacity, and statistical misuse. This study presents a diagnostic critique of the recently proposed Exponential Trigonometric Optimizer (ETO), exposing fundamental flaws in its algorithmic structure and the statistical reporting of its performance. Through a stripped mathematical reconstruction, we identify inert symbolic constructs, ill-defined recurrence schedules, and ineffective update mechanisms that collectively undermine the algorithm's purported balance and effectiveness. A principled benchmarking comparison against nine established metaheuristics on the CEC 2017 and 2021 suites reveals that ETO's performance claims are inflated. While it demonstrates mid-tier competitiveness, it consistently fails against top-tier algorithms, especially under high-dimensional and shift-rotated landscapes. Our statistical framework, employing rank-based non-parametric tests and effect size diagnostics, quantifies these limitations and highlights ETO's structural fragility and lack of scalability. The paper concludes by advocating for a reformist framework in metaheuristic research, emphasizing symbolic hygiene, operator attribution, and statistical transparency to mitigate misleading narratives and foster a more robust and reproducible optimization literature.

Abstract: Homeostatic mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining optimal functionality within the neural circuits of the brain. By regulating physiological and biochemical processes, these mechanisms ensure the stability of an organism's internal environment, enabling it to better adapt to external changes. Among these mechanisms, the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory has been extensively studied as a key principle for maintaining the balance of synaptic strengths in biological systems. Despite the extensive development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a model for bionic neural networks, no prior work in the machine learning community has integrated biologically plausible BCM formulations into SNNs to provide homeostasis. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Weight Adaptation Mechanism (DWAM) for SNNs, inspired by the BCM theory. DWAM can be integrated into the host SNN, dynamically adjusting network weights in real time to regulate neuronal activity, providing homeostasis to the host SNN without any fine-tuning. We validated our method through dynamic obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal and specifically designed degraded conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DWAM not only enhances the performance of SNNs without existing homeostatic mechanisms under various degraded conditions but also further improves the performance of SNNs that already incorporate homeostatic mechanisms.

Result: 在静态和神经形态数据集上的实验显示，TaWQ能效高（4.12M, 0.63mJ），在ImageNet上量化损失仅0.22%。

Conclusion: TaWQ能在脉冲神经网络权重量化时保持高能量效率，且量化损失可忽略不计。

Abstract: Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.

Abstract: Multi-swarm particle optimisation algorithms are gaining popularity due to their ability to locate multiple optimum points concurrently. In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster. An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO (TImPSO) has resulted from these enhancements and has been tested against three competing algorithms in the same family using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets, resulting in an improved peak ratio for almost all the test functions.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/gigaevo-core.

Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.

Abstract: A suitable choice of the representation of candidate solutions is crucial for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms and related metaheuristics. We focus on problems in permutation spaces, which are at the core of numerous practical applications of such algorithms, e.g. in scheduling and transportation. Inversion vectors (also called Lehmer codes) are an alternative representation of the permutation space $S_n$ compared to the classical encoding as a vector of $n$ unique entries. In particular, they do not require any constraint handling. Using rigorous mathematical runtime analyses, we compare the efficiency of inversion vector encodings to the classical representation and give theory-guided advice on their choice. Moreover, we link the effect of local changes in the inversion code space to classical measures on permutations like the number of inversions. Finally, through experimental studies on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems, we demonstrate the practical efficiency of inversion vector encodings.

*Robert Krahn,Josia Mädler,Christoph Seidl,Christof Fetzer*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 提出通用配置调优器Groot，评估显示其能提升性能并减少资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专业参数调优器存在局限，无法满足专业创新企业（SIVs）多领域、多目标、自定义技术栈等需求。

Method: 设计通用配置调优器Groot，使其对特定领域或用例无关、平衡多优化目标、支持不同自定义技术设置、对参数类型等假设最少。

Result: 在实际用例和基准测试中，Groot能可靠提升性能并减少资源消耗。

Conclusion: Groot可有效应对SIVs场景中的性能和资源消耗问题。

Abstract: Modern software systems are executed on a runtime stack with layers (virtualization, storage, trusted execution, etc.) each incurring an execution and/or monetary cost, which may be mitigated by finding suitable parameter configurations. While specialized parameter tuners exist, they are tied to a particular domain or use case, fixed in type and number of optimization goals, or focused on a specific layer or technology. These limitations pose significant adoption hurdles for specialized and innovative ventures (SIVs) that address a variety of domains and use cases, operate under strict cost-performance constraints requiring tradeoffs, and rely on self-hosted servers with custom technology stacks while having little data or expertise to set up and operate specialized tuners. In this paper, we present Groot - a general-purpose configuration tuner designed to a) be explicitly agnostic of a particular domain or use case, b) balance multiple potentially competing optimization goals, c) support different custom technology setups, and d) make minimal assumptions about parameter types, ranges, or suitable values. Our evaluation on both real-world use cases and benchmarks shows that Groot reliably improves performance and reduces resource consumption in scenarios representative for SIVs.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 提出Low - Rank GEMM方法处理大矩阵乘法，在NVIDIA RTX 4090上表现优异，有内存节省和加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大矩阵乘法计算复杂度高，需新方法降低复杂度并保持硬件加速性能。

Method: 利用低秩矩阵近似，结合FP8精度和智能内核选择，系统可根据硬件和矩阵特性选择最优分解方法和精度级别。

Result: 在NVIDIA RTX 4090上，对最大N = 20480的矩阵实现378 TFLOPS，节省75%内存，比PyTorch FP32快7.8倍，N≥10240时超越传统cuBLAS实现。

Conclusion: Low - Rank GEMM是处理大矩阵乘法的有效方法，通过优化内存带宽而非计算捷径实现高性能。

Abstract: Large matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of modern machine learning workloads, yet traditional approaches suffer from cubic computational complexity (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for a matrix of size $n\times n$). We present Low-Rank GEMM, a novel approach that leverages low-rank matrix approximations to achieve sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining hardware-accelerated performance through FP8 precision and intelligent kernel selection. On a NVIDIA RTX 4090, our implementation achieves up to 378 TFLOPS on matrices up to $N=20480$, providing 75\% memory savings and $7.8\times$ speedup over PyTorch FP32 for large matrices. The system automatically adapts to hardware capabilities, selecting optimal decomposition methods (SVD, randomized SVD) and precision levels based on matrix characteristics and available accelerators. Comprehensive benchmarking on NVIDIA RTX 4090 demonstrates that Low-Rank GEMM becomes the fastest approach for matrices $N\geq10240$, surpassing traditional cuBLAS implementations through memory bandwidth optimization rather than computational shortcuts.

Motivation: 需求工程质量多依赖经验和直觉，创建模型需实证数据，但获取成本高，且AI开发使需求质量因素可能改变。

Method: 提出用Agentic AI模拟，在随机、动态、事件驱动的定性模拟中用标准化代理复制软件工程过程。

Conclusion: Agentic AI模拟可作为需求工程研究有价值的补充，但需研究其复制人类行为的局限。

Abstract: Context and motivation. Quality in Requirements Engineering (RE) is still predominantly anecdotal and intuition-driven. Creating a solid requirements quality model requires broad sets of empirical evidence to evaluate quality factors and their context. Problem. However, empirical data on the detailed effects of requirements quality defects is scarce, since it is costly to obtain. Furthermore, with the advent of AI-based development, the requirements quality factors may change: Requirements are no longer only consumed by humans, but increasingly also by AI agents, which might lead to a different efficient and effective requirements style. Principal ideas. We propose to extend the RE research toolbox with Agentic AI simulations, in which software engineering (SE) processes are replicated by standardized agents in stochastic, dynamic, event-driven, qualitative simulations. We argue that their speed and simplicity makes them a valuable addition to RE research, although limitations in replicating human behavior need to be studied and understood. Contribution. This paper contributes a first concept, a research roadmap, a prototype, and a first feasibility study for RE simulations with agentic AI. Study results indicate that even a naive implementation leads to executable simulations, encouraging technical improvements along with broader application in RE research.

Conclusion: 该工作将设计原则转化为可验证约束嵌入工具，对需求工程有贡献，未来有IDE集成等发展方向。

Abstract: RESTful APIs are central in developing interoperable, modular, and maintainable software systems in enterprises today. Also, it is essential to support system evolution, service interoperability, and governance across organizational boundaries to ensure good quality and consistency of these APIs. However, evaluating API design quality, which is part of non-functional requirement tasks, remains a largely manual and ad hoc process, particularly during early development. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, we elicited user needs, identified 75 API design rules using a literature review, and implemented a configurable rule engine to detect structural violations in OpenAPI specifications. The proposed tool supports organizational adaptability by allowing rules to be customized, enabled, or disabled, enabling integration of domain-specific standards. The evaluation was conducted through structured experiments and thematic analysis involving industry experts. API quality validation contributes to aligning technical designs with requirements and enterprise architecture by strengthening interoperability and governance between enterprise systems. The results show that S.E.O.R.A facilitates early validation of non-functional API requirements, provides actionable and traceable feedback, and aligns well with requirements elicitation and quality assurance processes. It improves the API design process by automating checks that would otherwise require manual inspection, thus supporting consistent and reusable conformance practices. This work contributes to requirements engineering by operationalizing design principles as verifiable constraints and embedding them into a practical validation tool. Future directions include IDE integration, expanded rule coverage, and real-world deployment to support continuous compliance in agile API development lifecycles.

Modern kiosk systems are confronted with significant challenges, including a lack of integration, structural rigidity, performance bottlenecks, and the absence of collaborative frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用大语言模型的两阶段管道，从自然语言规范生成形式化协议规范用于测试，原型AUTOSPEC证明了方法可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言规范手动生成测试用例慢且易出错，形式化规范编写和维护繁琐，需弥合两者差距。

Method: 提出两阶段管道，先从自然语言规范提取协议元素，再合成和完善形式化协议规范。

Result: 原型AUTOSPEC在五个互联网协议上验证了方法可行性，平均恢复一定比例的消息类型，在不同系统上实现较高消息接受率。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法优于端到端基于LLM的测试生成，能产生可检查规范、无需LLM生成测试用例、形式化规范可读且可完善。

Abstract: Safety- and security-critical systems have to be thoroughly tested against their specifications. The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.
  We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.
  Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing. In its evaluation, AUTOSPEC recovers on average 92.8% of client and 80.2% of server message types, and achieves 81.5% message acceptance across diverse, real-world systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出TokenRepair框架提升自动程序修复性能，实验效果佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动程序修复技术依赖粗粒度外部反馈，缺乏细粒度内部信号，导致修复效率低、性能不佳。

Method: 提出TokenRepair两阶段细化框架，结合内部反思定位潜在错误标记，用外部反馈进行质量感知的补丁细化。

Result: TokenRepair达到新的最优修复性能，在Defects4J 1.2和HumanEval - Java上修复大量bug，有显著提升。

Conclusion: TokenRepair框架有效提升自动程序修复性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for automated program repair (APR). However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch. It then applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting to refine only these localized tokens, enabling targeted and fine-grained correction. To further stabilize the iterative repair loop, TokenRepair incorporates a quality-aware external feedback mechanism that evaluates patch quality and filters out low-quality candidates before refinement. Experimental results show that TokenRepair achieves new state-of-the-art repair performance, correctly fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, demonstrating substantial improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% across all models on Defects4J 1.2 and from 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RESTful API测试在云原生应用质量保证中愈发重要，利用LLM自动执行测试活动。

Method: 开发MASTEST系统，结合LLM和编程智能体形成完整工具链，支持人工审查修正；在两个LLM和五个公共API上评估，用多种指标衡量性能。

Result: DeepSeek和GPT - 4o总体表现好，DeepSeek在数据类型正确性和状态码检测上出色，GPT - 4o在API操作覆盖上最佳；LLM生成测试脚本语法正确性达100%，语义修正只需少量人工编辑。

Conclusion: MASTEST系统有效可行。

Abstract: Testing RESTful API is increasingly important in quality assurance of cloud-native applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需满足国际法规和标准的严格计时约束，现有黑盒方法无法透明分析计时行为。

Method: 提出基于事件链建模的白盒方法，对各功能组件计时行为进行透明分析，在架构层面推导、建模和验证端到端计时约束，并通过仿真进行早期验证。

Result: 通过案例研究，该方法能早期识别合规问题、进行系统参数优化，并通过概率分析生成定量证据。

Conclusion: 基于事件链的方法可增强法规合规性、优化系统设计并支持基于模型的安全分析技术。

Abstract: Automated Driving Systems (ADS), including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), must fulfill not only high functional expectations but also stringent timing constraints mandated by international regulations and standards. Regulatory frameworks such as UN regulations, NCAP standards, ISO norms, and NHTSA guidelines impose strict bounds on system reaction times to ensure safe vehicle operation. This paper presents a structured, White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling to address these timing challenges. Unlike Black-Box approaches, Event-Chain Analysis offers transparent insights into the timing behavior of each functional component - from perception and planning to actuation and human interaction. This perspective is also aligned with multiple regulations, which require that homologation dossiers provide evidence that the chosen system architecture is suitable to ensure compliance with the specified requirements. Our methodology enables the derivation, modeling, and validation of end-to-end timing constraints at the architectural level and facilitates early verification through simulation. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate how this Event-Chain-centric approach enhances regulatory compliance, optimizes system design, and supports model-based safety analysis techniques, with results showing early identification of compliance issues, systematic parameter optimization, and quantitative evidence generation through probabilistic analysis.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自动规划（AP）模型生成应用广泛，但在分层规划（HP）的应用不够成熟，旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 提出支持HP模型生成的L2HP扩展库，基于L2P；在PlanBench数据集上对比LLMs在AP和HP的建模能力。

Result: 解析成功率在两种设置下有限但相近（约36%），分层规划的语法有效性远低于非分层情况（1%对20%）。

Conclusion: HP对LLMs有独特挑战，需进一步研究提升生成的HP模型质量。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) is still far from reaching the level of sophistication observed in non-hierarchical architectures. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models.

Motivation: 开源环境下建立和维护软件发布说明与开发工件的可追溯性链接易出错、耗时且常被忽视，当前存在大量缺乏或损坏的链接。

Method: 分析发布说明信息，构建含3500个实例的基准数据集，用LLM方法自动建立三对可追溯性链接，结合时间邻近特征。

Result: LLM方法如Gemini 1.5 Pro在PR可追溯性恢复上Precision@1值达0.73，在线调查显示多数从业者认为可追溯性维护重要。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM方法能有效自动建立软件发布说明与开发工件的可追溯性链接，具有较高可用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Maintaining traceability links between software release notes and corresponding development artifacts, e.g., pull requests (PRs), commits, and issues, is essential for managing technical debt and ensuring maintainability. However, in open-source environments where contributors work remotely and asynchronously, establishing and maintaining these links is often error-prone, time-consuming, and frequently overlooked. Our empirical study of GitHub repositories revealed that 47% of release artifacts lacked traceability links, and 12% contained broken links. To address this gap, we first analyzed release notes to identify their What, Why, and How information and assessed how these align with PRs, commits, and issues. We curated a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,500 filtered and validated traceability link instances. Then, we implemented LLM-based approaches to automatically establish traceability links of three pairs between release note contents & PRs, release note contents & PRs and release note contents & issues. By combining the time proximity feature, the LLM-based approach, e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved a high Precision@1 value of 0.73 for PR traceability recovery. To evaluate the usability and adoption potential of this approach, we conducted an online survey involving 33 open-source practitioners. 16% of respondents rated as very important, and 68% as somewhat important for traceability maintenance.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在软件工程中因用户规范不当导致的可靠性问题

Method: 提出CodeMetaAgent框架，结合MRs和LLMs生成语义约束测试用例

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上评估，代码生成准确性提升达17%，代码覆盖率增益达99.81%

Conclusion: MRs可作为简单有效的指南辅助基于LLM的软件开发

Abstract: Metamorphic Relations (MRs) serve as a foundational mechanism for generating semantically equivalent mutations. Software engineering has advanced significantly in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reliability of LLMs in software engineering is often compromised by ambiguities and inconsistencies due to improper user specification. To address this challenge, we present CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a metamorphic relation-driven LLM agent that systematically refines task specifications and generates semantically constrained test cases. Our proposed framework uses MRs with LLMs to improve generation consistency and reduce variability caused by specifications, unlike the traditional use of MRs as post validations. Our framework has been evaluated on the HumanEval-Pro, MBPP-Pro, and SWE-Bench_Lite datasets using the GPT-4o, Mistral Large, GPT-OSS, and Qwen3-Coder models. It improved code generation accuracy by up to 17% and achieved code coverage gains of up to 99.81%. These results show that metamorphic relations can be a simple but effective guide in assisting LLM-based software development.

Abstract: Symbolic execution is an important software analysis technique which benefits downstream tasks such as software testing and debugging. However, several limitations hinder symbolic execution from application on real-world software. One of the limitations is the inability to solve diverse execution path constraints: traditional symbolic execution based on SMT solvers is difficult to handle execution paths with complex data structures or external API calls. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibility of adopting large language models (LLM) for path constraint solving instead of traditional solver-based techniques in symbolic execution. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the ability of LLMs in two types of path constraint solving: generating test inputs to facilitate an execution path, and determining whether a given execution path can be satisfied without triggering any bugs. We build new evaluation pipelines and benchmarks for two tasks: test case generation and path classification, which include data sources from both competition-level programs and real-world repositories. Our experiment results show that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve path constraints in both generation and classification tasks, with 60% of generated test cases that accurately cover the given execution path. Moreover, LLMs are capable of improving test coverage by covering execution paths in real-world repositories where traditional symbolic execution tools cannot be applied. These findings highlight the possibility of extending symbolic execution techniques with LLMs in the future to improve the ability and generalizability of symbolic execution.

Result: LLMs优于传统方法，但存在精度低、推理成本高问题，TreeRec能提升不同LLMs性能。

Conclusion: TreeRec具有通用性和实际部署潜力。

Abstract: In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work. Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.

Abstract: We study how to evaluate hybrid quantum programs as end-to-end workflows rather than as isolated devices or algorithms. Building on the Hybrid Quantum Program Evaluation Framework (HQPEF), we formalize a workflow-aware Quantum Readiness Level (QRL) score; define a normalized speedup under quality constraints for the Utility of Quantumness (UQ); and provide a timing-and-drift audit for hybrid pipelines. We complement these definitions with concise Python reference implementations that illustrate how to instantiate the metrics and audit procedures with state-of-the-art classical and quantum solvers (e.g., via Qiskit or PennyLane), while preserving matched-budget discipline and reproducibility.

Abstract: Software logging is critical for system observability, yet developers face a dual crisis of costly overlogging and risky underlogging. Existing automated logging tools often overlook the fundamental whether-to-log decision and struggle with the composite nature of logging. In this paper, we propose Autologger, a novel hybrid framework that addresses the complete the end-to-end logging pipeline. Autologger first employs a fine-tuned classifier, the Judger, to accurately determine if a method requires new logging statements. If logging is needed, a multi-agent system is activated. The system includes specialized agents: a Locator dedicated to determining where to log, and a Generator focused on what to log. These agents work together, utilizing our designed program analysis and retrieval tools. We evaluate Autologger on a large corpus from three mature open-source projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that Autologger achieves 96.63\% F1-score on the crucial whether-to-log decision. In an end-to-end setting, Autologger improves the overall quality of generated logging statements by 16.13\% over the strongest baseline, as measured by an LLM-as-a-judge score. We also demonstrate that our framework is generalizable, consistently boosting the performance of various backbone LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

Abstract: Organizations are rapidly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform their operations, yet they lack clear guidance on key decisions for adoption and implementation. While LLMs offer powerful capabilities in content generation, assisted coding, and process automation, businesses face critical challenges in data security, LLM solution development approach, infrastructure requirements, and deployment strategies. Healthcare providers must protect patient data while leveraging LLMs for medical analysis, financial institutions need to balance automated customer service with regulatory compliance, and software companies seek to enhance development productivity while maintaining code security.
  This article presents a systematic six-step decision framework for LLM adoption, helping organizations navigate from initial application selection to final deployment. Based on extensive interviews and analysis of successful and failed implementations, our framework provides practical guidance for business leaders to align technological capabilities with business objectives. Through key decision points and real-world examples from both B2B and B2C contexts, organizations can make informed decisions about LLM adoption while ensuring secure and efficient integration across various use cases, from customer service automation to content creation and advanced analytics.

Motivation: 随着AI生成漏洞报告增多，缺乏帮助漏洞猎手理解报告无效原因的研究，需预测无效报告并解释原因，提高报告质量和减轻评审负担。

Method: 收集9942份漏洞赏金报告数据集，评估GPT - 5、DeepSeek和微调的RoBERTa等模型，构建信息披露漏洞拒绝原因分类法并融入RAG框架，分析报告人声誉对评审的影响。

Result: 模型整体准确率高但难检测无效案例，易过度接受报告；RAG框架显著提高分类一致性和减少偏差；报告人声誉高在边缘案例中更易获有利结果。

Conclusion: 识别无效报告有挑战，结合大语言模型和结构化评审知识可支持更透明一致的漏洞报告评审。

Abstract: Bug bounty platforms (e.g., HackerOne, BugCrowd) leverage crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery to improve continuous coverage, reduce the cost of discovery, and serve as an integral complement to internal red teams. With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid. To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.
  In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports. We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports. While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports. To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias. We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report. Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.
  Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mHealth应用存在可用性和可及性挑战，自适应用户界面虽有解决方案但存在采用障碍，需了解用户偏好和权衡以确保设计被广泛接受。

Method: 对186名慢性病且使用mHealth应用的参与者进行离散选择实验，用混合logit模型分析偏好异质性，进行亚组分析。

Result: 保持可用性、可控性、不频繁适应和小规模变化促进采用，常用功能和护理人员参与降低适应感知价值。

Conclusion: 采用数据驱动方法量化用户偏好，为未来自适应mHealth应用开发提供指导，为软件工程领域需求优先级研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) applications are widely used for chronic disease management, but usability and accessibility challenges persist due to the diverse needs of users. Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a personalized solution to enhance user experience, yet barriers to adoption remain. Understanding user preferences and trade-offs is essential to ensure widespread acceptance of adaptation designs. This study identifies key factors influencing user preferences and trade-offs in mHealth adaptation design. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted with 186 participants who have chronic diseases and use mHealth applications. Participants were asked to select preferred adaptation designs from choices featuring six attributes with varying levels. A mixed logit model was used to analyze preference heterogeneity and determine the factors most likely influencing adoption. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to explore differences by age, gender, health conditions, and coping mechanisms. Maintaining usability while ensuring controllability over adaptations, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes are key factors that facilitate the adoption of adaptive mHealth app designs. In contrast, frequently used functions and caregiver involvement can diminish the perceived value of such adaptations. This study employs a data-driven approach to quantify user preferences, identify key trade-offs, and reveal variations across demographic and behavioral subgroups through preference heterogeneity modeling. Furthermore, our results offer valuable guidance for developing future adaptive mHealth applications and lay the groundwork for continued exploration into requirements prioritization within the field of software engineering.

Conclusion: ChroniUXMag为将包容性纳入mHealth需求提供了可重复、基于证据的方法。

Abstract: Mobile health (mHealth) applications are increasingly adopted for chronic disease management, yet they face persistent challenges related to accessibility, inclusivity, and sustained engagement. Patients' needs evolve dynamically with their health progression, adherence, and caregiver support, creating unique requirements engineering (RE) challenges that traditional approaches often overlook. This study introduces ChroniUXMag, a framework for eliciting and analysing inclusivity requirements in mHealth design. Building on InclusiveMag and GenderMag principles, the framework aims to help researchers and practitioners systematically capture and evaluate factors that influence how individuals with chronic conditions perceive, trust, and interact with mHealth systems. The framework was developed through two stages of the InclusiveMag process. In the first stage, inclusivity facets were identified through a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews, and a large-scale survey. In the second stage, these facets were synthesised into personas representing diverse health situations, attitudes, and digital practices, and integrated into an adapted cognitive walkthrough form. Thirteen facets were identified that capture the socio-technical complexity of mHealth use, including trust, digital literacy, dependency, and cultural context. These facets support structured, persona-driven evaluations that reveal inclusivity barriers often missed by traditional usability assessments. ChroniUXMag contributes to RE by offering a reproducible, evidence-based approach for embedding inclusivity into mHealth requirements. Future work will extend the third stage Apply through practitioner-led evaluation in real-world design contexts.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成的代码存在难以发现的细微实现级错误，而代码摘要能揭示高级意图，因此希望利用代码摘要进行程序修复。

Method: 提出摘要介导修复方法，将自然语言代码摘要作为显式中间步骤，在八个生产级大语言模型和两个人工智能编程评估基准上评估，对比不同摘要风格与直接修复基线。

Result: 错误感知诊断摘要效果最佳，平均比基线多修复5%的未见错误，最多可修复65%的未见错误，但整体改进不大且依赖于大语言模型。

Conclusion: 代码摘要可作为廉价、可解释的诊断工件集成到程序修复流程中，而非独立的万能解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce code with subtle implementation-level bugs despite strong benchmark performance. These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all.

Motivation: 现有LLM代码自动补全在决定何时提供建议方面研究不足，常导致中断或推理调用浪费。

Method: 结合近期接受率的逻辑变换和有界延迟范围，基于对开发者认知状态的高级二元预测动态调整建议延迟。

Result: 在两个月部署中，建议接受率从无延迟的4.9%、静态延迟的15.4%提升到自适应时机的18.6%，盲目拒绝率从8.3%降至0.36%，减少75%推理调用浪费。

Conclusion: 该机制使基于LLM的代码助手在实践中更高效且具成本效益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code auto-completion by generating context-aware suggestions. Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.

Motivation: 解决代码编辑器中大量AI代码建议被忽略，导致计算浪费、延迟增加和不必要中断的问题。

Method: 引入轻量级预过滤模型，仅利用开发者实时遥测数据（如打字速度、文件导航、编辑活动）预测建议接受可能性。

Result: 在生产级Visual Studio Code插件中部署四个月，接受率从18.4%提升到34.2%，抑制35%的低价值LLM调用。

Conclusion: 行为信号能有效改善LLM辅助编程的用户体验和系统效率，强调了时序感知、隐私保护的自适应机制的价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.

Motivation: 传统bisect的确定性谓词和二进制失败状态假设在现代软件开发中常被违反，需要新方法在嘈杂条件下进行故障定位。

Method: 用结构化思维链推理增强bisect遍历，评估多个LLM，用QLoRA在语义标注的数据集上微调DeepSeekCoderV2，采用弱监督工作流。

Result: 多个开源项目实验显示成功率从74.2%提升到80.6%，减少失败遍历次数，平均bisect时间最多减少2倍。

Conclusion: 讨论了针对提交级别行为分析的时间推理、提示设计和微调策略。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Git bisect process for semantic fault localization. Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human in the loop corrections and self consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open source projects show a 6.4 point absolute gain in success rate from 74.2 to 80.6 percent, leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and by experiment up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and finetuning strategies tailored for commit level behavior analysis.

Motivation: 现有内联代码基准测试缺乏对新兴RISC - V架构支持，无全面评估RVV扩展内联迁移能力的基准测试。

Method: 提出包含50个函数级任务及测试用例的VecIntrinBench，用其系统评估各种代码迁移方法。

Result: 高级大语言模型在RISC - V代码迁移中与规则映射方法效果相似且性能更优。

Conclusion: 开源VecIntrinBench，分析结果并指出大语言模型在代码迁移领域未来发展方向。

Abstract: Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features. Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.

Result: OATest在检测漏洞和代码覆盖率上优于现有方法，发现58个未知漏洞，36个已被开发者确认或修复。

Conclusion: OATest是一种有效的深度学习编译器测试方法，能更好地保障编译器的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) compilers have been widely utilized to optimize DL models for efficient deployment across various hardware. Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical. However, existing approaches have limitations in testing optimization stages, which is the core functionality of DL compilers, due to the difficulty in generating optimization-aware tests. In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-aware computational graphs. The approach combines patterns extracted from documented tests for optimization and incorporates them into seed computational graphs, enabling broader exploration of optimization paths. To guarantee the optimization-awareness of generated graphs, OATest introduces the edges reusing strategy to establish strong connections between patterns and contexts. Additionally, to solve the validity challenge for the generated graphs, OATest employs an auxiliary layers addition strategy to resolve broken constraints. Equipped with two distinct test oracles, OATest applies differential testing to evaluate the two widely used DL compilers (i.e., TVM and ONNXRuntime). Our experimental results show that OATest outperforms the state-of-the-art method by detecting more bugs and achieving higher code coverage in TVM and ONNXRutimes. Additionally, OATest uncovers 58 previously unknown bugs, 36 of which have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

Abstract: Linux kernel evolution breaks drivers through API/ABI changes, semantic shifts, and security-hardening updates. We introduce DRIVEBENCH, an executable corpus of kernel$\rightarrow$driver co-evolution cases, and AUTODRIVER, a closed-loop, LLM-driven system for automating driver maintenance. The system integrates prompt engineering, multi-agent collaboration, static analysis, and iterative validation to ensure that generated patches are not only syntactically correct but also functionally and semantically consistent with kernel conventions. The corpus spans v5.10-v6.10 with 235 validated cases drawn from 612 candidates. In evaluation across 55 cases, AUTODRIVER achieves 56.4% compilation success; QEMU-based boot verification indicates that compiled patches preserve driver initialization in most instances. By releasing DRIVEBENCH and tooling, we enable reproducible research and a practical route to continuous, safe co-evolution of drivers with the Linux kernel.

Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques.
  To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).

Abstract: Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.

Abstract: A well-known testing method for the safety evaluation and real-time validation of automotive software systems (ASSs) is Fault Injection (FI). In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time. The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper. To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated. Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively. To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study. This novel approach offers a means of optimizing the real-time testing process, thereby reducing costs while simultaneously enhancing the safety properties of complex safety-critical ASSs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a technique to help choose the best formal specification candidate among a set of alternatives. Given a set of specifications, our technique generates a suite of test cases that, once classified by the user as desirable or not, narrows down the set of candidates to at most one specification. Two alternative solver-based algorithms are proposed, one that generates a minimal test suite, and another that does not ensure minimality. Both algorithms were implemented in a prototype that can be used generate test suites to help choose among alternative Alloy specifications. Our evaluation of this prototype against a large set of problems showed that the optimal algorithm is efficient enough for many practical problems, and that the non-optimal algorithm can scale up to dozens of candidate specifications while still generating reasonably sized test suites.

Result: 在多个特定领域语言上实验有效且具泛化性，静态验证器通过率超95%，在低资源编程语言上优于监督微调方法。

Conclusion: SLMFix有潜力替代传统微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches.

Conclusion: 语义工程是一种轻量级方法，能让基于大语言模型的系统更准确反映开发者意图，无需完全手动设计提示。

Abstract: AI-Integrated programming is emerging as a foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems with large language models (LLMs). Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.

Abstract: This research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.

Conclusion: 所提出的策略能在不影响财务表现的情况下降低碳排放强度。

Abstract: Given the increasing importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, particularly carbon emissions, we investigate optimal proportional portfolio insurance (PPI) strategies accounting for carbon footprint reduction. PPI strategies enable investors to mitigate downside risk while retaining the potential for upside gains. This paper aims to determine the multiplier of the PPI strategy to maximise the expected utility of the terminal cushion, where the terminal cushion is penalised proportionally to the realised volatility of stocks issued by firms operating in carbon-intensive sectors. We model the risky assets' dynamics using geometric Brownian motions whose drift rates are modulated by an unobservable common stochastic factor to capture market-specific or economy-wide state variables that are typically not directly observable. Using classical stochastic filtering theory, we formulate a suitable optimization problem and solve it for CRRA utility function. We characterise optimal carbon penalised PPI strategies and optimal value functions under full and partial information and quantify the loss of utility due incomplete information. Finally, we carry a numerical analysis showing that the proposed strategy reduces carbon emission intensity without compromising financial performance.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效，可让含坐标数据集丰富有意义空间特征。

Abstract: Incorporating spatial information, particularly those influenced by climate, weather, and demographic factors, is crucial for improving underwriting precision and enhancing risk management in insurance. However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.

Abstract: For long term investments, model portfolios are defined at the level of indexes, a setup known as Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA). The possible outcomes at a scale of a few decades can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a probability density for the possible portfolio values at the investment horizon. Such studies are critical for long term wealth plannings, for example in the financial component of social insurances or in accumulated capital for retirement. The quality of the results depends on two inputs: the process used for the simulations and its parameters. The base model is a constant drift, a constant covariance and normal innovations, as pioneered by Bachelier. Beyond this model, this document presents in details a multivariate process that incorporate the most recent advances in the models for financial time series. This includes the negative correlations of the returns at a scale of a few years, the heteroskedasticity (i.e. the volatility' dynamics), and the fat tails and asymmetry for the distributions of returns. For the parameters, the quantitative outcomes depend critically on the estimate for the drift, because this is a non random contribution acting at each time step. Replacing the point forecast by a probabilistic forecast allows us to analyze the impact of the drift values, and then to incorporate this uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: We revisit the well-studied superhedging problem under proportional transaction costs in continuous time using the recently developed tools of set-valued stochastic analysis. By relying on a simple Black-Scholes-type market model for mid-prices and using continuous trading schemes, we define a dynamic family of superhedging sets in continuous time and express them in terms of set-valued integrals. We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets.

Abstract: Debt recycling is a leveraged equity management strategy in which homeowners use accumulated home equity to finance investments, applying the resulting returns to accelerate mortgage repayment. We propose a novel framework to model equity and mortgage dynamics in presence of mortgage interest rates, borrowing costs on equity-backed credit lines, and tax shields arising from interest deductibility. The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.

Conclusion: 提出的QFT增强量子核在短期时间序列预测上表现良好，还讨论了局限性和NISQ执行路径。

Abstract: This study proposes a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)-enhanced quantum kernel for short-term time-series forecasting. Each signal is windowed, amplitude-encoded, transformed by a QFT, then passed through a protective rotation layer to avoid the QFT/QFT adjoint cancellation; the resulting kernel is used in kernel ridge regression (KRR). Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients. For both quantum and classical models, the only tuned quantities are the feature-mixing weights and the KRR ridge alpha; classical hyperparameters (gamma, r, d) are fixed, with the same validation set size for all models. Experiments are conducted on a noiseless simulator (5 qubits; window length L=32). Limitations and ablations are discussed, and paths toward NISQ execution are outlined.

Abstract: Data assimilation is a fundamental task in updating forecasting models upon observing new data, with applications ranging from weather prediction to online reinforcement learning. Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Node popularity is recognized as a key factor in modeling real-world networks, capturing heterogeneity in connectivity across communities. This concept is equally important in bipartite networks, where nodes in different partitions may exhibit varying popularity patterns, motivating models such as the Two-Way Node Popularity Model (TNPM). Existing methods, such as the Two-Stage Divided Cosine (TSDC) algorithm, provide a scalable estimation approach but may have limitations in terms of accuracy or applicability across different types of networks. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient and theoretically justified variational expectation-maximization (VEM) framework for the TNPM. We establish label consistency for the estimated community assignments produced by the proposed variational estimator in bipartite networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our method achieves superior estimation accuracy across a range of bipartite as well as undirected networks compared to existing algorithms.

TL;DR: 研究Wasserstein - Fisher - Rao (WFR)梯度流中W和FR算子评估顺序的影响，发现合理选择步长和算子顺序，分裂方案收敛更快，并探讨W - FR和FR - W分裂的适用场景。


<details>

Motivation: 现有算法开发隐式使用算子分裂技术近似WFR偏微分方程，本文旨在研究W和FR算子评估顺序的影响并进行定量分析。

Method: 推导描述两种顺序分裂方案单步演化的变分公式。

Result: 合理选择步长和算子顺序时，分裂方案比精确WFR流收敛更快；证明WFR梯度流保持对数凹性，得到WFR的首个精确衰减界。

Conclusion: 给出了在何种设置下应优先选择W - FR分裂而非FR - W分裂。

Abstract: Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) gradient flows have been recently proposed as a powerful sampling tool that combines the advantages of pure Wasserstein (W) and pure Fisher-Rao (FR) gradient flows. Existing algorithmic developments implicitly make use of operator splitting techniques to numerically approximate the WFR partial differential equation, whereby the W flow is evaluated over a given step size and then the FR flow (or vice versa). This works investigates the impact of the order in which the W and FR operator are evaluated and aims to provide a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that with a judicious choice of step size and operator ordering, the split scheme can converge to the target distribution faster than the exact WFR flow (in terms of model time). We obtain variational formulae describing the evolution over one time step of both sequential splitting schemes and investigate in which settings the W-FR split should be preferred to the FR-W split. As a step towards this goal we show that the WFR gradient flow preserves log-concavity and obtain the first sharp decay bound for WFR.

Method: 基于狄利克雷回归，引入基于分位数残差的分裂共形方法和结合快速坐标下限近似与内部网格细化的最高密度区域策略。

Result: 蒙特卡罗研究表明分位数残差和网格细化HDR方法经验覆盖率接近90%且区域更窄；实际应用中网格细化HDR覆盖率最接近目标且平均宽度最小。

Conclusion: 单纯形上的共形预测可以校准且高效，能为成分预测任务提供实用的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a set of conformal prediction procedures tailored to compositional responses, where outcomes are proportions that must be positive and sum to one. Building on Dirichlet regression, we introduce a split conformal approach based on quantile residuals and a highest-density region strategy that combines a fast coordinate-floor approximation with an internal grid refinement to restore sharpness. Both constructions are model-agnostic at the conformal layer and guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability, while respecting the geometry of the simplex. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study spanning homoscedastic and heteroscedastic designs shows that the quantile residual and grid-refined HDR methods achieve empirical coverage close to the nominal 90\% level and produce substantially narrower regions than the coordinate-floor approximation, which tends to be conservative. We further demonstrate the methods on household budget shares from the BudgetItaly dataset, using standardized socioeconomic and price covariates with a train, calibration, and test split. In this application, the grid-refined HDR attains coverage closest to the target with the smallest average widths, closely followed by the quantile residual approach, while the simple triangular HDR yields wider, less informative sets. Overall, the results indicate that conformal prediction on the simplex can be both calibrated and efficient, providing practical uncertainty quantification for compositional prediction tasks.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a variant of Sparse Polyak for high dimensional M-estimation problems. Sparse Polyak proposes a novel adaptive step-size rule tailored to suitably estimate the problem's curvature in the high-dimensional setting, guaranteeing that the algorithm's performance does not deteriorate when the ambient dimension increases. However, convergence guarantees can only be obtained by sacrificing solution sparsity and statistical accuracy. In this work, we introduce a variant of Sparse Polyak that retains its desirable scaling properties with respect to the ambient dimension while obtaining sparser and more accurate solutions.

Conclusion: LSGPs在预测自杀企图上有潜力，能应对患者异质性和数据有限问题。

Abstract: Ecological Momentary Assessment provides real-time data on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but predicting suicide attempts remains challenging due to their rarity and patient heterogeneity. We show that single models fit to all patients perform poorly, while individualized models improve performance but still overfit to patients with limited data. To address this, we introduce Latent Similarity Gaussian Processes (LSGPs) to capture patient heterogeneity, enabling those with little data to leverage similar patients' trends. Preliminary results show promise: even without kernel-design, we outperform all but one baseline while offering a new understanding of patient similarity.

Result: 在温和正则条件下建立了渐近族系错误率控制，在多个基准测试中比常用方法显著减少错误选择。

Conclusion: 所提方法即使无真实治疗效果也可行且有效。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting the best heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimator from a collection of candidates in settings where the treatment effect is fundamentally unobserved. We cast estimator selection as a multiple testing problem and introduce a ground-truth-free procedure based on a cross-fitted, exponentially weighted test statistic. A key component of our method is a two-way sample splitting scheme that decouples nuisance estimation from weight learning and ensures the stability required for valid inference. Leveraging a stability-based central limit theorem, we establish asymptotic familywise error rate control under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, our procedure provides reliable error control while substantially reducing false selections compared with commonly used methods across ACIC 2016, IHDP, and Twins benchmarks, demonstrating that our method is feasible and powerful even without ground-truth treatment effects.

Abstract: We propose a way of transforming the problem of conditional density estimation into a single nonparametric regression task via the introduction of auxiliary samples. This allows leveraging regression methods that work well in high dimensions, such as neural networks and decision trees. Our main theoretical result characterizes and establishes the convergence of our estimator to the true conditional density in the data limit. We develop condensité, a method that implements this approach. We demonstrate the benefit of the auxiliary samples on synthetic data and showcase that condensité can achieve good out-of-the-box results. We evaluate our method on a large population survey dataset and on a satellite imaging dataset. In both cases, we find that condensité matches or outperforms the state of the art and yields conditional densities in line with established findings in the literature on each dataset. Our contribution opens up new possibilities for regression-based conditional density estimation and the empirical results indicate strong promise for applied research.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides distribution-free, finite-sample coverage guarantees but critically relies on exchangeability, a condition often violated under distribution shift. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations at test time, focusing on both coverage validity and the resulting prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis characterizes how the strength of adversarial perturbations during calibration affects coverage guarantees under adversarial test conditions. We further examine the impact of adversarial training at the model-training stage. Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness.

Conclusion: 本文工作是差分隐私下依赖数据系统研究的第一步。

Abstract: Dependent data underlies many statistical studies in the social and health sciences, which often involve sensitive or private information. Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\textit{item-level}) and \textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $μ\in \R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how learning performance improves with data, compute, or training time, and have become a central theme in modern deep learning. We study this phenomenon in a canonical nonlinear model: phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs whose covariance spectrum follows a power law. Unlike the isotropic case, where dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system, anisotropy yields a qualitatively new regime in which an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations governs the evolution of the summary statistics. We develop a tractable reduction that reveals a three-phase trajectory: (i) fast escape from low alignment, (ii) slow convergence of the summary statistics, and (iii) spectral-tail learning in low-variance directions. From this decomposition, we derive explicit scaling laws for the mean-squared error, showing how spectral decay dictates convergence times and error curves. Experiments confirm the predicted phases and exponents. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, highlighting how anisotropy reshapes learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 稳定性和极小极大最优后悔之间存在根本矛盾，能否设计兼具两者的算法是重要开放问题。

Abstract: Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.
  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is a crucial concept in computational topology, providing a multiscale topological description of a space. It is particularly significant in topological data analysis, which aims to make statistical inference from a topological perspective. In this work, we introduce a new topological summary for Bayesian neural networks, termed the predictive topological uncertainty (pTU). The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through various experiments, in terms of its statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness.

Conclusion: 差分隐私可融入增强公平性的流程，对公平性保证影响最小，所提算法能达到最优的准确性、公平性和隐私性权衡。

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in sensitive applications demands algorithms that simultaneously preserve data privacy and ensure fairness across potentially sensitive sub-populations. While privacy and fairness have each been extensively studied, their joint treatment remains poorly understood. Existing research often frames them as conflicting objectives, with multiple studies suggesting that strong privacy notions such as differential privacy inevitably compromise fairness. In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm our theoretical results, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness/privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.

Conclusion: CR - UOT框架能有效解决UOT在异质空间中选择地面传输成本的挑战。

Abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) provides a flexible way to match or compare nonnegative finite Radon measures. However, UOT requires a predefined ground transport cost, which may misrepresent the data's underlying geometry. Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.

Conclusion: 理论分析适用于近端因果推断。

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL模型用于EHR问答系统在临床环境部署有挑战，缺乏评估事后验证机制的统一基准。

Method: 引入SCARE基准，涵盖4200个三元组，基于多个数据库，包含多种文本到SQL模型生成的查询，对多种方法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验揭示问题分类和SQL错误纠正之间存在关键权衡。

Conclusion: 指出当前存在的关键挑战，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of text-to-SQL models that allow clinicians to query structured data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using natural language. However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research.

### [398] [Path-Constrained Retrieval: A Structural Approach to Reliable LLM Agent Reasoning Through Graph-Scoped Semantic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18313)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型代理从知识库检索的上下文与当前推理状态缺乏结构一致性，导致推理链不连贯。

Method: 引入Path - Constrained Retrieval (PCR)，结合结构图约束与语义搜索，将搜索空间限制在从锚节点可达的节点。

Result: 在PathRAG - 6基准测试中，PCR实现了完全的结构一致性，相关性得分高；在技术领域表现远超向量搜索和混合检索；相比基线方法，平均图距离降低78%。

Conclusion: 路径约束检索是提高大语言模型代理推理系统可靠性和连贯性的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.

Abstract: The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at https://github.com/jjjycaptain/Skeletron.

TL;DR: 本文提出用共形预测进行上下文工程，能在RAG中实现可靠、可控覆盖的上下文缩减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG在处理长或嘈杂上下文时LLM准确率下降，现有预生成过滤器缺乏对保留证据的统计控制。

Method: 采用共形预测这一覆盖控制过滤框架，使用基于嵌入和LLM的评分函数，在NeuCLIR和RAGTIME集合上测试。

Result: 共形过滤能达到目标覆盖，将保留上下文减少2 - 3倍，在NeuCLIR上严格过滤时下游事实准确性提高，中等覆盖时保持稳定。

Conclusion: 共形预测能在RAG中实现可靠、可控覆盖的上下文缩减，是一种与模型无关且有原则的上下文工程方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.

Motivation: 为自然语言词统计和大语言模型标记统计提供结构基础的零模型。

Method: 构建独立字母和空格符号序列的文本模型，在无形态、句法和语义假设下推导结构结果。

Result: 词长服从几何分布；给定长度的词和不同词数量有封闭表达式；得到Zipf型秩频律。

Conclusion: Zipf模式可仅由组合和分割产生，有助于明确需深入解释的现象。

Abstract: We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.
  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.

Motivation: 现有代理推荐系统缺乏面向推荐的设计，未充分利用用户 - 项目交互历史中的协作信号，导致推荐结果不佳。

Method: 将传统协同过滤算法与基于大语言模型的多智能体协作类比，实例化相似用户和相关项目为具有独特配置文件的大语言模型智能体，使用中央协调器智能体通过动态智能体招募和个性化协作指令来管理用户和项目智能体之间的协作。

Result: 在三个不同领域的数据集上的实验表明，MACF框架优于强大的代理推荐基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的MACF框架在代理推荐方面具有优势。

Abstract: Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.

Conclusion: GAM框架能有效利用前沿大语言模型的代理能力和测试时可扩展性，解决静态内存的局限性。

Abstract: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.

Result: 标准模型表现差，推理收益小，网络搜索提升有限，策展RAG系统平均提高宏F1 233%。

Conclusion: 让模型访问策展的高质量上下文是自动事实核查的可行途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.

Result: 在各种基准和大语言模型上实验，A³比四个基线模型任务性能最佳，TTFT减少2倍。

Conclusion: A³算法能有效解决大语言模型长文本处理问题，降低计算开销并提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.

Conclusion: 有助于促进大语言模型可控性和可靠性的进一步研究。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提出的生成式缓存方法有效，能提高缓存命中率并减少执行延迟。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用且可扩展的复杂现实公民模拟方法。

Abstract: Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.

Abstract: The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DeepDebater/tree/main

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.

Result: 基于出现次数的特征单独使用时预测能力弱，与对数概率结合时在模型内在不确定性较高的数据集上有适度提升。

Conclusion: 词汇覆盖率特征为幻觉检测提供了补充信号。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型在生成无结构自然语言响应方面表现出色，但在文本到结构任务上的表现不明，需评估其相关能力。

Method: 引入综合基准OmniStruct，确定适合结构化答案格式的现有数据集并统一问题设置；通过合成任务生成收集高质量训练数据。

Result: 在不使用OmniStruct任务监督数据的情况下，小模型在合成数据上微调后可达到与GPT - 4o相媲美的性能。

Conclusion: 存在将小模型在合成数据上微调为通用结构化生成模型的可能性。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.

Result: 电路定位用集成和正则化策略取得显著进展，因果变量定位用低维和非线性投影取得显著进展。

Conclusion: MIB排行榜开放，鼓励继续使用该标准评估框架推动MI研究。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.

Abstract: Although the community has tackled the acquisition of high-quality Arabic pretraining data, we still lack large-scale, multi-turn Arabic datasets that include reasoning and tool calling. Naive translation can work at the pretraining scale, but post-training demands much higher quality, which requires a stricter approach to dataset curation. In this work, we introduce SmolKalam, a translation of Smoltalk2 that uses a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline, applies quality filtering, and examines effective translation techniques for traditional decoder-only models through ablations.

Method: 与专业临床心理学家合作设计MindEval框架，通过患者模拟和大语言模型自动评估，框架全自动化、与模型无关。先验证模拟患者文本真实性，证明自动评估与专家判断有强相关性，再评估12个模型。

Result: 评估的12个模型表现不佳，平均得分低于4分（满分6分），在特定AI沟通模式上有弱点，推理能力和模型规模不能保证更好表现，长时间互动或支持重症患者时系统性能下降。

Conclusion: MindEval框架可用于评估语言模型在心理健康治疗对话中的表现，当前模型在该场景下存在诸多问题，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.

Motivation: 报纸是重要信息源，但处理大量新闻内容有挑战，新闻标题情感分析有助于理解新闻情感基调，当前缺乏相关研究。

Method: 运用自然语言处理技术，采用混合迁移学习模型BERT - CNN - BiLSTM，对9014条新闻标题的BAN - ABSA数据集进行实验，使用两种实验策略。

Result: 策略1中过采样在标题和情感分类上表现好，分别为78.57%和73.43%；策略2中直接在原始不平衡数据集训练结果最佳，分别为81.37%和64.46%。模型优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的模型为孟加拉语新闻标题分类和情感分析取得了新的最优结果，证明利用标题和情感数据集很重要，为低资源情况下的孟加拉语文本分类提供了基线。

Abstract: In our daily lives, newspapers are an essential information source that impacts how the public talks about present-day issues. However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\% and 73.43\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\% and 64.46\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.

Conclusion: 结构化生成可创建综合词汇资源，OpenGloss反映了当前基础模型的能力与局限，且公开可用。

Abstract: We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.
  Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks.
  As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.

Result: 目标缓解有时能减少预期维度的偏差，但常导致其他维度的负面后果，如增加模型偏差和降低整体连贯性。

Conclusion: 在研究和开发偏见缓解策略时，需要强大的多维评估工具以避免在非目标轴上转移或恶化偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.

Result: RhinoInsight在深度研究任务上达到了最先进的性能，在深度搜索任务上也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: RhinoInsight框架通过添加控制机制能有效提升大语言模型在深度研究中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.

Conclusion: HyperbolicRAG能有效捕捉细粒度语义和全局层次结构，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.

Result: 在十个基准测试中，SPINE比TTRL持续提高Pass@1，避免响应长度崩溃，训练动态更稳定。

Conclusion: 使更新与思维链分支点对齐是推理模型在测试时稳定有效自适应的简单无标签机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.

Conclusion: Blu - WERP是先进预处理管道，能提升LLM训练数据质量和模型性能，降低计算成本，对以数据为中心的AI研究有贡献。

Abstract: High-quality training data is fundamental to large language model (LLM) performance, yet existing preprocessing pipelines often struggle to effectively remove noise and unstructured content from web-scale corpora. This paper presents Blu-WERP, a novel data preprocessing pipeline designed to optimize the quality of Common Crawl WARC files for LLM training. We demonstrate that Blu-WERP significantly outperforms established baselines including DCLM across multiple model scales and evaluation benchmarks. Our pipeline processes CC WARC dumps, implementing advanced filtering and quality assessment mechanisms. We conducted comprehensive evaluations using models with 150M, 400M, 530M, 750M, and 1B parameters, testing against nine standard benchmarks categorized as World Knowledge & Reasoning, Language Understanding, and Commonsense Reasoning. Results show Blu-WERP consistently achieved superior performance across all model scales. At the 1B parameter scale, Relatively Blu-WERP demonstrates a 4.0% and 9.5% aggregate improvement over DCLM and Fineweb respectively, while achieving quality-per-token efficiency gain. Categorical analysis reveals 2.4% improvement in World Knowledge & Reasoning, 6.2% improvement in Language Understanding, and 4.2% improvement in Commonsense Reasoning. These results establish Blu-WERP as a state-of-the-art preprocessing pipeline that substantially improves LLM training data quality and downstream model performance with reduced computational cost. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on data-centric AI, demonstrating that preprocessing pipeline design significantly impacts LLM capabilities. The Blu-WERP pipeline represents a practical advancement in data quality optimization, offering researchers and practitioners an effective solution for improving LLM training efficiency and model performance.

Result: 在更新的数据集上的大量实验验证了CoreEval的鲁棒性，证明其能缓解数据污染导致的性能高估问题。

Conclusion: CoreEval策略能有效缓解数据污染对大模型评估公平性的影响。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.

Method: 引入基准，包含静态和动态问题集，评估商业模型使用网络搜索的情况。

Result: 网络搜索提升了GPT - 5 - mini和Claude Haiku 4.5的静态准确率，但信心校准变差；动态查询准确率低于70%；每次提升准确率的调用成本低，但初始检索失败后收益递减；选择性调用有帮助，但搜索后模型过度自信且不一致。

Conclusion: 内置网络搜索可提升事实准确性，但模型存在过度自信等问题，更适合作为低延迟验证层，有改进空间。

Abstract: Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.

TL;DR: 提出GraphMind框架，结合GNN和LLMs用于多步推理，实验表明其性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏显式动态机制来表示和演化中间推理状态，限制上下文感知定理选择和迭代结论生成能力。

Method: 提出GraphMind框架，将GNN与LLMs集成，把推理过程建模为异质演化图，用GNN编码推理状态并利用语义匹配选择定理。

Result: 在各种问答数据集上实验，GraphMind方法性能持续提升，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: GraphMind方法有效且具有泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 解决以往研究在自然语言命名系统中依赖最优听者和跨语言通用交际需求这两个简化假设的局限性。

Method: 引入离散对象命名系统的信息论框架，采用指称博弈设置，聚焦亲属关系语义域。

Result: 证明当且仅当听者解码器等同于说话者的贝叶斯解码器时，可实现最优权衡，且最优性在学习的通信系统中能经验性出现。

Conclusion: 提出的信息论框架能有效研究自然语言命名系统的最优权衡问题。

Abstract: The structure of naming systems in natural languages hinges on a trade-off between high informativeness and low complexity. Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.

Motivation: 探究Transformer模型如何及在何处察觉句子语义异常。

Method: 使用精心挑选的语料评估phi - 2模型，分析各层隐藏状态，用线性探测进行每层检测，研究编码违规的有效维度。

Result: 线性解码器在模型最低三分之一层难以区分合理和不合理结尾，中间层准确率大幅提升；违规先拓宽表征子空间，经中间瓶颈后收缩。

Conclusion: 结果可能与经典心理语言学中人类阅读的发现一致，语义异常在句法解析后被检测到。

Abstract: How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.

Conclusion: 框架为定性研究提供实用指南，代码等公开利于复现和扩展。

Abstract: Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts. All code, data processing scripts, and evaluation protocols are publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work.

Conclusion: RLER方法有效，DR Tulu模型表现出色，开源资源利于未来研究。

Abstract: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.
  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.
  We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了现有基于BWT索引在下游分析中的高成本问题，弥补了当前基于BWT的全基因组比对器的不足。

Abstract: Modern genomic analyses increasingly rely on pangenomes, that is, representations of the genome of entire populations. The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.

Conclusion: 自动生成配置文件提升了协作框架的可用性。

Abstract: The field of autonomous vehicle research is advancing rapidly, necessitating platforms that meet real-time performance, safety, and security requirements for practical deployment. AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter.

Abstract: Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.

Abstract: This study informs the design of future multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms by guiding choices based on constraint classification for constraint-based search algorithms. We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints. Recommendations extend to Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), emphasizing the importance of considering topological features alongside problem, solution, and representation features.

Abstract: Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We introduce AIRHILT (Aviation Integrated Reasoning, Human-in-the-Loop Testbed), a modular and lightweight simulation environment designed to evaluate multimodal pilot and air traffic control (ATC) assistance systems for aviation conflict detection. Built on the open-source Godot engine, AIRHILT synchronizes pilot and ATC radio communications, visual scene understanding from camera streams, and ADS-B surveillance data within a unified, scalable platform. The environment supports pilot- and controller-in-the-loop interactions, providing a comprehensive scenario suite covering both terminal area and en route operational conflicts, including communication errors and procedural mistakes. AIRHILT offers standardized JSON-based interfaces that enable researchers to easily integrate, swap, and evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual detection, decision-making, and text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate AIRHILT through a reference pipeline incorporating fine-tuned Whisper ASR, YOLO-based visual detection, ADS-B-based conflict logic, and GPT-OSS-20B structured reasoning, and present preliminary results from representative runway-overlap scenarios, where the assistant achieves an average time-to-first-warning of approximately 7.7 s, with average ASR and vision latencies of approximately 5.9 s and 0.4 s, respectively.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how implicit neural feed back can accelerate reinforcement learning in complex robotic manipulation settings. While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition.

Result: 结合轨迹转移和行为克隆两种方法实验，ObAct显著优于静态相机设置，轨迹转移无遮挡时提升145%、有遮挡时提升233%，行为克隆分别提升75%和143%。

Conclusion: ObAct框架能增强观察清晰度和可见性，使训练的策略更鲁棒，在主动视觉模仿学习中有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose Observer Actor (ObAct), a novel framework for active vision imitation learning in which the observer moves to optimal visual observations for the actor. We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

Abstract: Delicate snap-fit assemblies, such as inserting a lens into an eye-wear frame or during electronics assembly, demand timely engagement detection and rapid force attenuation to prevent overshoot-induced component damage or assembly failure. We address these challenges with two key contributions. First, we introduce SnapNet, a lightweight neural network that detects snap-fit engagement from joint-velocity transients in real-time, showing that reliable detection can be achieved using proprioceptive signals without external sensors. Second, we present a dynamical-systems-based dual-arm coordination framework that integrates SnapNet driven detection with an event-triggered impedance modulation, enabling accurate alignment and compliant insertion during delicate snap-fit assemblies. Experiments across diverse geometries on a heterogeneous bimanual platform demonstrate high detection accuracy (over 96% recall) and up to a 30% reduction in peak impact forces compared to standard impedance control.

Motivation: 数据驱动的软连续体机器人动力学学习缺乏物理可解释性，基于模型的方法需要先验知识且计算成本高，需弥合两者差距。

Method: 引入ABCD模块用于基于自编码器的潜动力学学习，生成注意力图；将注意力图与二维振荡器网络耦合实现动力学可视化。

Conclusion: 该全数据驱动方法得到紧凑、具有物理可解释性的模型，适用于控制应用。

Abstract: Data-driven learning of soft continuum robot (SCR) dynamics from high-dimensional observations offers flexibility but often lacks physical interpretability, while model-based approaches require prior knowledge and can be computationally expensive. We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.

TL;DR: 现有潜在安全过滤器在视觉运动控制中存在不足，本文提出LatentCBF方法解决相关问题，实验表明其能实现平滑安全过滤并提高任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在安全过滤器采用离散切换策略影响任务性能，且当前潜在空间学习方法生成的价值函数与控制障碍函数不兼容。

Method: 提出LatentCBF，通过梯度惩罚得到平滑边缘函数，采用混合标称和安全策略分布数据的价值训练程序。

Result: 在模拟基准和基于视觉的操作策略硬件实验中，LatentCBF能实现平滑安全过滤，任务完成率比先前切换方法提高一倍。

Conclusion: LatentCBF有效解决了现有潜在安全过滤器的问题，能在保证安全的同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Latent safety filters extend Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability to operate on latent state representations and dynamics learned directly from high-dimensional observations, enabling safe visuomotor control under hard-to-model constraints. However, existing methods implement "least-restrictive" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a "margin function" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods.

Abstract: Existing humanoid control systems often rely on teleoperation or modular generation pipelines that separate language understanding from physical execution. However, the former is entirely human-driven, and the latter lacks tight alignment between language commands and physical behaviors. In this paper, we present SENTINEL, a fully end-to-end language-action model for humanoid whole-body control. We construct a large-scale dataset by tracking human motions in simulation using a pretrained whole body controller, combined with their text annotations. The model directly maps language commands and proprioceptive inputs to low-level actions without any intermediate representation. The model generates action chunks using flow matching, which can be subsequently refined by a residual action head for real-world deployment. Our method exhibits strong semantic understanding and stable execution on humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world deployment, and also supports multi-modal extensions by converting inputs into texts.

Motivation: VLA模型处理冗余视觉令牌计算开销大，标准令牌修剪技术难以保留关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出Compressor - VLA框架，包含语义任务压缩器（STC）和空间细化压缩器（SRC），由自然语言指令动态调节。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中取得有竞争力的成功率，减少59%的FLOPs和超3倍的视觉令牌数，验证了模型的仿真到现实的可迁移性和实用性。

Conclusion: Compressor - VLA框架有效，指令引导能使模型感知聚焦于任务相关对象。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 研究指出VLA模型训练中动作块长度（horizon）存在权衡问题，提出混合horizon策略（MoH），实验证明其在模拟和真实任务中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型性能受训练时动作块长度（horizon）影响，单一horizon选择并非最优，存在长horizon和短horizon的权衡问题。

Method: 提出MoH策略，将动作块重新排列成不同horizon的多个段，用共享动作变压器并行处理，并用轻线性门融合输出。

Result: MoH能联合利用长期远见和短期精度，对全注意力动作模块即插即用，支持动态推理，实验显示其在模拟和真实任务中均有显著提升，如π₀.₅在MoH下在LIBERO上达到99%平均成功率。

Conclusion: MoH策略能有效缓解VLA模型中horizon的权衡问题，提升模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

Conclusion: 设计的算法能在特定情况下有效解决可生存网络设计问题，且具有较好的近似比和时间复杂度。

Abstract: We investigate a process of joining $k$ random spanning trees on a fixed clique $K_n$. The joined trees may not be disjoint and multiple edges are replaced by one simple edge. This process produces a simple graph $G$ on $n$~vertices with an edge set, which is a union of edge sets of the joined trees. We study a random variable $S_{k}$ of the number of edges in the generated graph $G$. The exact formula is derived for the expected value of the random variable $S_{k}$. In addition, an upper bound on the concentration coefficient of the random variable $S_{k}$ is provided. We use results of our analysis to design an algorithm to generate $k$-edge connected graphs for arbitrarily large values of $k \geq 2$. The designed algorithm solves a particular case of the Survivable Network Design Problem, where the cost of each edge is $c_{e} = 1$ and the connectivity requirement for each pair of vertices $u, v \in V(G)$ is $k$.The proposed algorithm is within a factor strictly less than $2$ of the optimal value (i.e., the number of edges in the generated graph) and its running time is $O(kn\log{n})$.

Motivation: AAA壁应力是破裂风险标志物，但通常用未知心动相位的单相图像计算，线性应力恢复法对未知成像相位的鲁棒性未知。

Method: 分析公共4D - CTA队列中两个患者特定的AAA，对比舒张和合成收缩几何形状下的线性应力，比较线性和非线性分析结果。

Result: 收缩压下舒张与合成收缩几何形状的线性恢复99%分位数应力差异在分割不确定性内；脉压下线性恢复与非线性分析的99%分位数应力接近。

Conclusion: 支持在临床静态单相成像中使用线性应力恢复法进行患者特定的AAA分析。

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall stress is a candidate rupture risk marker but is typically computed from single-phase images without known cardiac phase. Linear stress recovery methods, which solve a single geometrically linear equilibrium problem on the imaged, already-loaded geometry, have been validated for static stress estimation, but their robustness to unknown imaging phase remains unexplored. We investigated whether imaging phase materially biases 99th percentile stress recovered linearly, and whether linear recovery agrees with non-linear analysis under matched loads. Two patient-specific AAAs from a public 4D-CTA cohort (Case 1: 5.5% strain; Case 2: 4.5% strain) were analyzed. For each, we analyzed diastolic and synthetic systolic geometry, the latter generated by warping the diastolic mesh via displacements from non-linear hyperelastic analysis. Linear stresses were recovered on both geometries under systolic pressure and compared via 99th-percentile maximum principal stress, stress distributions, and 3D stress differential contours. Linear stresses under pulse pressure were compared against non-linear stresses. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery on diastolic vs synthetic systolic geometries under systolic pressure differed by 8.6% (Case 1) and 3.5% (Case 2), within segmentation uncertainty. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery and non-linear analysis under pulse pressure agreed closely: 0% difference (Case 1) and 1.1% (Case 2), with nearly identical distributions. These findings support linear stress recovery for patient-specific AAA analysis in clinical settings with static single-phase imaging, offering a computationally efficient alternative without compromising accuracy or requiring patient-specific wall properties.

Result: CPC-based方法促进了明显的偏见多样性，更符合用户的真实政治容忍度，而经典方法隐式利用偏见来最大化交互。

Conclusion: CPC-based方法在新闻推荐中能更好地解决偏见问题，优于经典方法。

Abstract: In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.

Conclusion: 多点BAX显著降低成本，是黑盒优化的有前景替代方案，有望用于未来光源、对撞机和大型科学设施设计。

Abstract: We demonstrate that multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution can overcome fundamental computational challenges in storage ring design optimization. Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design. We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.

Abstract: Next-generation (NextG) cellular networks are expected to manage dynamic traffic while sustaining high performance. Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access networks (RANs) will serve vertical industries with stringent requirements: smart grids, autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare, industrial automation, etc. To achieve these requirements, modern 5G/6G design increasingly leverage AI for network optimization, but the opacity of AI decisions poses risks in mission-critical domains. These use cases are often delivered via non-public networks (NPNs) or dedicated network slices, where reliability and safety are vital. In this paper, we motivate the need for transparent and trustworthy AI in high-stakes communications (e.g., healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics) by drawing on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)'s vision for non-public networks. We design a mathematical framework to model the trade-offs between transparency (explanation fidelity and fairness), latency, and graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization in deploying explainable AI (XAI) models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid XAI model xAI-Native, consistently surpasses conventional baseline models in performance.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security & reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD-a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated & open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农民在作物收获前后保护作物免受动物和鸟类侵害的问题。

Method: 在田地周围布置不同传感器节点检测动物或鸟类，通过ZigBee将信息传递给驱离和通知系统（RNS），RNS发出动物和鸟类无法忍受的超声波，同时系统可通过短信通知农民。

Result: 能有效使动物和鸟类逃离田地，实现对作物的保护。

Conclusion: 该系统成本低、功耗低，对成本和电力是关键因素的发展中国家系统可行性有重要优势。

Abstract: One of the main problems for farmers is the protection of their crops, before and after harvesting, from animals and birds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer. The low cost and power efficiency of the proposed system is a key advantage for developing countries where cost and power are major players in any system feasibility.

Method: 提出时空无线电地图预测任务，引入RadioMapMotion数据集，提出基于ConvLSTM的UNet架构RadioLSTM用于多步序列预测。

Result: RadioLSTM比代表性基线方法有更高预测精度和结构保真度，推理延迟低。

Conclusion: RadioLSTM适合实时网络操作，项目将公开。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs), which provide location-based pathloss estimations, are fundamental to enabling proactive, environment-aware communication in 6G networks. However, existing deep learning-based methods for RM construction often model dynamic environments as a series of independent static snapshots, thereby omitting the temporal continuity inherent in signal propagation changes caused by the motion of dynamic entities. To address this limitation, we propose the task of spatio-temporal RM prediction, which involves forecasting a sequence of future maps from historical observations. A key barrier to this predictive approach has been the lack of datasets capturing continuous environmental evolution. To fill this gap, we introduce RadioMapMotion, the first large-scale public dataset of continuous RM sequences generated from physically consistent vehicle trajectories. As a baseline for this task, we propose RadioLSTM, a UNet architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and designed for multi-step sequence forecasting. Experimental evaluations show that RadioLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy and structural fidelity compared to representative baseline methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits a low inference latency, indicating its potential suitability for real-time network operations. Our project will be publicly released at: https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/RadioMapMotion upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源行业工业自动化需要能在网络不可用时自主运行的AI系统，而以云为中心的架构无法满足这一需求，因此评估DFC - AI在能源领域操作中的应用。

Method: 对能源领域场景进行全面模拟，包括无人机检查、传感器网络和工人安全系统，还进行了严格的统计分析。

Result: DFC - AI在网络中断时能保持完整操作能力，而基于云或网关的系统会完全或部分失效；实现显著的延迟降低和能源节省；对于某些能源领域工作负载，基于网关的边缘解决方案成本可能高于云解决方案，而DFC - AI可利用企业自有设备节省成本。

Conclusion: DFC - AI能解决能源行业操作的独特挑战，确保智能代理在偏远油田、海上平台等恶劣环境中可用且功能正常。

Abstract: Industrial automation in the energy sector requires AI systems that can operate autonomously regardless of network availability, a requirement that cloud-centric architectures cannot meet. This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.

Conclusion: ZoomDiff在生成移动数据管理方面有强大潜力。

Abstract: Multi-layer mobile network traffic generation is a key approach to capturing multi-scale network dynamics, supporting network planning, and promoting generative management of mobile data. Existing methods focus on generating network traffic with a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to achieve joint generation of multi-scale traffic. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based multi-scale mobile traffic generation model. ZoomDiff maps the urban environmental context into network traffic with multiple spatiotemporal resolutions through custom-designed Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising process, enabling different stages to generate traffic with distinct spatial and temporal resolutions. It aligns the progressive denoising process of diffusion models with hierarchical network layers, including BSs, cells, and grids with different granularities. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ZoomDiff achieves a performance improvement of at least 18.4% over state-of-the-art baselines on generation tasks at multi-scale traffic. The efficiency and generalization ability are also demonstrated, which indicates that ZoomDiff holds strong potential for generative mobile data management. The code of ZoomDiff is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ZoomDiff-105E/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障检测方法难以平衡准确性和能耗，且未充分利用无线传感器网络数据的时空相关性。

Method: 采用两阶段流程，先使用LSTM堆叠自编码器的边缘分类器进行时间特征提取和初始故障类预测，再用图注意力网络聚合相邻节点信息完善分类。

Result: HiFiNet在准确性、F1分数和精度上显著优于现有方法，能识别多种故障类型。

Conclusion: HiFiNet具有鲁棒性和有效性，可根据不同操作要求调整诊断性能和能源效率的权衡。

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are the backbone of essential monitoring applications, but their deployment in unfavourable conditions increases the risk to data integrity and system reliability. Traditional fault detection methods often struggle to effectively balance accuracy and energy consumption, and they may not fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal correlations inherent in WSN data. In this paper, we introduce HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical fault identification framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. Firstly, edge classifiers with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder perform temporal feature extraction and output initial fault class prediction for individual sensor nodes. Using these results, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) then aggregates information from neighboring nodes to refine the classification by integrating the topology context. Our method is able to produce more accurate predictions by capturing both local temporal patterns and network-wide spatial dependencies. To validate this approach, we constructed synthetic WSN datasets by introducing specific, predefined faults into the Intel Lab Dataset and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFiNet significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in identifying diverse fault types. Furthermore, the framework's design allows for a tunable trade-off between diagnostic performance and energy efficiency, making it adaptable to different operational requirements.

Motivation: 让运营商在客户感知前发现服务水平协议（SLA）违规的现实触发因素，保障现代无线接入网（RAN）平稳运行

Method: 对网络数据进行标记，区分与过去SLA违规相关的异常记录和正常记录，让模型学习从正常行为到故障的因果链

Result: 蒙特卡罗测试中能高精度确定正确触发序列，处理数百万数据点不降低速度

Conclusion: 高分辨率、按因果顺序的洞察可使故障管理从被动排查转向主动预防

Abstract: To keep modern Radio Access Networks (RAN) running smoothly, operators need to spot the real-world triggers behind Service-Level Agreement (SLA) breaches well before customers feel them. We introduce an AI/ML pipeline that does two things most tools miss: (1) finds the likely root-cause indicators and (2) reveals the exact order in which those events unfold. We start by labeling network data: records linked to past SLA breaches are marked `abnormal', and everything else `normal'. Our model then learns the causal chain that turns normal behavior into a fault. In Monte Carlo tests the approach pinpoints the correct trigger sequence with high precision and scales to millions of data points without loss of speed. These results show that high-resolution, causally ordered insights can move fault management from reactive troubleshooting to proactive prevention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究基于块和交易交付后观察估算节点连接有益性，因块到达不频繁和节点连接不稳定，有益性分数无法收敛到预期值，需改进。

Method: 设计DyPBP，引入记忆特征解决动态连接问题，在活跃比特币节点上实现并使用机器学习进行有益性预测。

Result: 实验验证了DyPBP的有效性，误差性能根据机器学习模型选择提高2到13个数量级，记忆特征为模型选择提供参考。

Conclusion: DyPBP能在新块到达前从连接开始就估算P2P连接的有益性。

Abstract: Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networking delivers the new blocks and transactions and is critical for the cryptocurrency blockchain system operations. Having poor P2P connectivity reduces the financial rewards from the mining consensus protocol. Previous research defines beneficalness of each Bitcoin peer connection and estimates the beneficialness based on the observations of the blocks and transactions delivery, which are after they are delivered. However, due to the infrequent block arrivals and the sporadic and unstable peer connections, the peers do not stay connected long enough to have the beneficialness score to converge to its expected beneficialness. We design and build Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction (DyPBP) which predicts a peer's beneficialness by using networking behavior observations beyond just the block and transaction arrivals. DyPBP advances the previous research by estimating the beneficialness of a peer connection before it delivers new blocks and transactions. To achieve such goal, DyPBP introduces a new feature for remembrance to address the dynamic connectivity issue, as Bitcoin's peers using distributed networking often disconnect and re-connect. We implement DyPBP on an active Bitcoin node connected to the Mainnet and use machine learning for the beneficialness prediction. Our experimental results validate and evaluate the effectiveness of DyPBP; for example, the error performance improves by 2 to 13 orders of magnitude depending on the machine-learning model selection. DyPBP's use of the remembrance feature also informs our model selection. DyPBP enables the P2P connection's beneficialness estimation from the connection start before a new block arrives.

Method: 提出Q学习框架，将过程建模为带哈希状态的马尔可夫决策过程，利用奖励函数动态学习最优调度策略。

Result: 在最多300节点的静态网络模拟中，比现有启发式算法延迟最多降低10.87%。

Conclusion: 该框架能在物联网环境实现及时洞察，为可扩展、低延迟数据聚合奠定基础。

Abstract: Time-critical data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks demands efficient, collision-free scheduling to minimize latency for applications like smart cities and industrial automation. Traditional heuristic methods, with two-phase tree construction and scheduling, often suffer from high computational overhead and suboptimal delays due to their static nature. To address this, we propose a novel Q-learning framework that unifies aggregation tree construction and scheduling, modeling the process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hashed states for scalability. By leveraging a reward function that promotes large, interference-free batch transmissions, our approach dynamically learns optimal scheduling policies. Simulations on static networks with up to 300 nodes demonstrate up to 10.87% lower latency compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm, highlighting its robustness for delay-sensitive IoT applications. This framework enables timely insights in IoT environments, paving the way for scalable, low-latency data aggregation.

TL;DR: 本文提出无偏、风险感知的6G网络切片智能协商框架，验证其可消除SLA违规，降低延迟，揭示有偏方法的弊端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G智能自主网络存在不确定性忽视偏差，影响网络可信度，需解决该问题以确保资源分配的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于数字孪生（DTs）预测完整延迟分布，用条件风险价值（CVaR）评估的框架，要求智能体量化认知不确定性以做出可靠决策。

Result: 有偏的基于均值的基线方法SLA违规率达25%，无偏的CVaR感知智能体消除SLA违规，降低URLLC和eMBB的p99.999延迟约11%，能源节省率降至17%。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建6G所需的可信自主系统提供了具体方法。

Abstract: A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.

We use these tools to construct a new nineteenth-century U.S. index from more than 360 million newspaper articles and exploratory cross-country indices with a single multilingual model. Taken together, our results show that LLMs can systematically improve text-derived measures and should be integrated as explicit measurement tools in empirical economics.

Method: 采用定量研究方法，以37,200名农业小农户为总体，用概率抽样和简单随机技术选取380个样本，通过偏最小二乘结构方程模型（PLS - SEM）分析数据。

Result: 金融可得性与粮食安全呈正相关，R2值为0.615，表明二者联系紧密。

Conclusion: 需要改善金融机构并实施有利政策，使农民获得实现粮食安全所需的金融资源。

Abstract: Access to finance is vital for improving food security, particularly in developing nations where agricultural production is crucial. Despite several financial interventions targeted at increasing agricultural production, smallholder farmers continue to lack access to reasonable, timely, and sufficient financing, limiting their ability to invest in improved technology and inputs, lowering productivity and food supply. This study examines the relationship between access to finance and food security among smallholder farmers in Ogun State, employing institutional theory as a theoretical framework. The study takes a quantitative method, with a survey for the research design and a population of 37,200 agricultural smallholder farmers. A sample size of 380 was chosen using probability sampling and simple random techniques. The data were analysed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate a favourable relationship between access to finance and food security, with an R2-value of 0.615 indicating a robust link. These findings underline the need of improving financial institutions and implementing enabling policies to enable farmers have access to the financial resources they need to achieve food security outcomes.

Result: 员工在依赖AI可见时采用AI建议比率降低，任务绩效下降，即便评估者知晓员工过往表现，这种对AI依赖的降低仍存在。

Conclusion: 员工担心过度依赖AI表明自身判断缺乏信心，这种担忧难以缓解。

Abstract: Concerns about how workers are perceived can deter effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI). In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.

Abstract: Mutual trust is a key determinant of decision-making in economic interactions, yet actual behavior often diverges from equilibrium predictions. This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior.

Abstract: We revisit Esteban and Ray's (1994) seminal model of polarization. Their main result (unnecessarily) relies on the assumption that individuals are infinitely divisible, which imposes strong restrictions on admissible polarization indices. We show that relaxing this assumption yields a broader family of indices consistent with the original axioms. The resulting indices avoid counter-intuitive rankings that arise when using results on the original paper and provide greater flexibility for empirical applications.

Abstract: The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出SALPA框架用于星载LiDAR系统地理定位校正，在不同地形验证效果好，可适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星载LiDAR系统地理定位不确定性影响森林剖面估计，现有校正方法有局限。

Method: 提出SALPA多算法优化框架，整合三种优化范式与五种距离度量，利用全球可用数据探索连续解空间。

Result: 在不同地形验证，比原GEDI位置提升15 - 16%，比GeoGEDI算法提升0.5 - 2%，不同算法在不同场景有优势。

Conclusion: SALPA框架可适应新任务，为全球地理定位校正提供通用基础，利于森林监测和气候政策决策。

Abstract: Spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, such as NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide forest structure for global carbon assessments. However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches. Validation across contrasting sites: topographically complex Nikko, Japan, and flat Landes, France, demonstrates 15-16% improvements over original GEDI positions and 0.5-2% improvements over the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm. L-BFGS-B with Area-based metrics achieves optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, while population-based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) excel in complex terrain. The platform-agnostic framework facilitates straightforward adaptation to emerging spaceborne LiDAR missions, providing a generalizable foundation for universal geolocation correction essential for reliable global forest monitoring and climate policy decisions.

Motivation: 训练带有复杂EI损失的DEQs时，通过定点计算进行隐式微分的实现具有挑战性。

Method: 模块化实现反向传播来简化训练。

Result: 隐式微分训练的DEQs优于用无雅可比反向传播训练的DEQs和其他基线方法；EI训练的DEQs近似不变先验的近端映射。

Conclusion: 模块化反向传播可简化DEQs训练，隐式微分训练的DEQs性能更好。

Abstract: Equivariant imaging (EI) enables training signal reconstruction models without requiring ground truth data by leveraging signal symmetries. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) are a powerful class of neural networks where the output is a fixed point of a learned operator. However, training DEQs with complex EI losses requires implicit differentiation through fixed-point computations, whose implementation can be challenging. We show that backpropagation can be implemented modularly, simplifying training. Experiments demonstrate that DEQs trained with implicit differentiation outperform those trained with Jacobian-free backpropagation and other baseline methods. Additionally, we find evidence that EI-trained DEQs approximate the proximal map of an invariant prior.

Motivation: 大型光度调查需快速可靠自动推断星系物理特性方法，模拟数据与真实调查存在域偏移问题。

Method: 提出域适应管道，用模拟TNG50星系训练，在有形态标签的真实SDSS星系上评估；训练三种骨干网络，使用焦点损失和有效数类加权，构建特征级域损失$L_D$，结合OT-based“top_$k$ soft matching”损失。

Result: 结合损失函数后，目标准确率（宏观F1）从无适应时的约46%（约30%）提升到约87%（约62.6%），域AUC接近0.5，表明潜在空间强混合。

Conclusion: 所提出的域适应方法结合多种损失函数能有效提升域对齐，提高目标准确率。

Abstract: Large photometric surveys will image billions of galaxies, but we currently lack quick, reliable automated ways to infer their physical properties like morphology, stellar mass, and star formation rates. Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based "top_$k$ soft matching" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\sim$46% ($\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\sim$87% ($\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.

Conclusion: 研究结果有生物学意义，还为优化和采样算法设计提供见解。

Abstract: Cell migration often exhibits long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion, even in the absence of external guidance cues such as chemical gradients or topographical constraints. These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.

Result: 在三个公开ST数据集上，DKAN性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DKAN为空间基因表达预测建立了新基准，为生物和临床研究提供有力工具。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

Abstract: We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.

Result: 与现有自动化系统和人类撰写的综述对比，ARISE 平均评分达 92.48，在多项指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: ARISE 是一种有效的自动化生成和改进学术综述论文的方法。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scholarly literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing comprehensive, high-quality academic surveys. Recent advancements in agentic systems offer considerable promise for automating tasks that traditionally require human expertise, including literature review, synthesis, and iterative refinement. However, existing automated survey-generation solutions often suffer from inadequate quality control, poor formatting, and limited adaptability to iterative feedback, which are core elements intrinsic to scholarly writing.
  To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE, an Agentic Rubric-guided Iterative Survey Engine designed for automated generation and continuous refinement of academic survey papers. ARISE employs a modular architecture composed of specialized large language model agents, each mirroring distinct scholarly roles such as topic expansion, citation curation, literature summarization, manuscript drafting, and peer-review-based evaluation. Central to ARISE is a rubric-guided iterative refinement loop in which multiple reviewer agents independently assess manuscript drafts using a structured, behaviorally anchored rubric, systematically enhancing the content through synthesized feedback.
  Evaluating ARISE against state-of-the-art automated systems and recent human-written surveys, our experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average rubric-aligned quality score of 92.48. ARISE consistently surpasses baseline methods across metrics of comprehensiveness, accuracy, formatting, and overall scholarly rigor.

Motivation: 解决动态系统中数据驱动算法遍历平均收敛缓慢的问题。

Method: 提出加权Birkhoff平均方法，并将其融入五个算法（wtDMD、wtEDMD、wtSINDy、加权谱测度估计、加权扩散预测）。

Result: 在从流体流到厄尔尼诺数据等多个例子中，加权方法成本低、易实现，且能从相同数据中得到更好结果。

Conclusion: 加权方法在动态系统数据驱动算法中有显著优势，值得应用。

Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Niño data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.

Motivation: 在MLIR中优化2D卷积。

Method: 通过SConvOp和卷积切片分析，将Linalg卷积转换为平铺和打包的通用操作，处理边缘情况，基于仿射方程推导操作。

Result: 在不同架构上取得较好性能，ARM SME达峰值60%，Intel AVX512达67%。

Conclusion: 结合静态形状分析与结构化策略有益，模块化设计便于扩展和持续优化卷积工作负载。

Abstract: This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.

Conclusion: 所提方法在处理具有复杂形状和尺度变化的医学分割任务中有效且稳健。

Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.

Conclusion: 跨噪声水平切换专家模型是打破图像扩散模型中似然性 - 质量权衡的有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.

Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.

Conclusion: 重建驱动的多模态学习可提升现代广播工作流自动化、可搜索性和内容管理效率。

Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.

Conclusion: 该方法增强可见度、保留结构，提高真实低光照交通场景下游感知可靠性。

Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入SWITCH基准测试以解决现有基准在测试自主智能与现实控制界面交互能力方面的不足，发现商业和开源LMMMs表现不佳，提供资源促进社区发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准很少测试自主智能在实际场景中的接地、部分可观测性和事后验证能力，而日常环境中的有形控制界面对自主智能提出了这些要求。

Method: 通过迭代发布创建了具身、任务驱动的基准测试SWITCH，其首次迭代SWITCH - Basic在以自我为中心的RGB视频输入和设备多样性条件下评估五项互补能力。

Result: 在351个任务、98种真实设备和电器上，商业和开源LMMMs即使在单步交互中表现也不稳定，常过度依赖文本线索，轻视视觉或视频证据。

Conclusion: SWITCH提供数据、代码和预留分割，以实现可重复评估，推动基准测试未来更具挑战性的迭代及训练数据集的创建。

Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets.

Abstract: Our study provides a full deep learning system for automated classification of brain tumors from MRI images, includes six benchmarked architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) and a custom built, compact CNN (1.31M params)). The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型（LLMs）和大视觉 - 语言模型（LVLMs）在计数任务中如何表征和计算数值信息。

Method: 进行包含重复文本和视觉项目的对照实验，通过因果中介和激活修补分析模型行为，设计工具CountScope进行数值内容的机理解释。

Result: 单个标记或视觉特征编码潜在位置计数信息可跨上下文提取和转移；数值表征逐层递进，低层编码小计数，高层表示大计数；存在内部计数器机制；LVLMs中数值信息出现在视觉嵌入中；模型依赖结构线索影响数值预测准确性。

Conclusion: 计数在LLMs中是结构化的逐层过程，LVLMs遵循相同模式，受视觉编码器属性影响。

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.

Motivation: 3D面部头像普及带来身份盗窃风险，现有2D对抗掩码方法无法用于3D头像，需保护3D头像身份。

Method: 对高斯颜色系数应用对抗扰动，由预训练人脸验证网络引导，不修改头像几何结构。

Result: 实现完全去识别，人脸检索和验证准确率降为0%，感知质量高（SSIM = 0.9555，PSNR = 35.52 dB），保留关键面部属性。

Conclusion: AEGIS能在最小视觉失真下实现强隐私保护。

Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.

Motivation: 现有医学模型处理影像存在局限，需更好模型辅助放射学任务。

Method: 在大量不同部位CT和MRI影像上预训练Pillar - 0模型，用LLMs构建RATE框架提取结构化标签。

Result: Pillar - 0在内部测试集和外部验证集上表现优于多个基线模型，还可用于肺癌风险预测、脑出血检测等任务。

Conclusion: Pillar - 0和RATE为构建高性能放射学系统提供开放、临床严谨基础。

Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.

Motivation: 当前自监督学习方法忽略程序活动的程序性本质，通过实验证明模型对程序顺序不敏感。

Method: 提出PL - Stitch自监督框架，结合基于Plackett - Luce模型的两个概率目标，主目标训练模型按时间顺序排序帧，次目标捕捉细粒度跨帧对象关联。

Result: 在五个手术和烹饪基准测试中表现优异，在手术阶段识别和烹饪动作分割上有显著提升。

Conclusion: PL - Stitch框架对程序性视频表示学习有效。

Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图室内雷达感知方法依赖隐式跨视图雷达特征关联，在复杂室内场景会导致特征匹配模糊和检测性能下降。

Method: 提出REXO，将DiffusionDet的2D边界框扩散过程提升到3D雷达空间，用噪声3D边界框引导显式跨视图雷达特征关联，结合人接触地面的先验知识减少扩散参数。

Result: 在HIBER数据集上比SOTA方法提升4.22 AP，在MMVR数据集上提升11.02 AP。

Conclusion: REXO方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了多视图室内雷达感知性能。

Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

Result: 方法产生多样、高质量样本，准确估计重要性权重和期望。

Conclusion: 推进了流匹配模型输出的可靠表征，代码将公开。

Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.

Result: 用简单数据微调不仅能实现所需控制，效果还优于用逼真真实数据微调的模型。

Conclusion: 给出框架从直观和定量角度解释上述现象。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MGA - VQA框架有效解决了当前DocVQA方法的问题，提高了推理透明度和性能。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.

Result: DAVDD在多个基准测试的所有IPC设置下取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习对高质量视听数据集蒸馏是有效的。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.

Result: 在ImageNet - 1k - LT上，ADSA使尾部类别准确率最高提升11.8%，整体准确率达41.4%。

Conclusion: ADSA在有限标签预算和多种蒸馏技术下是一个强大且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

Conclusion: PA - FAS能更好地统一多模态融合、泛化和可解释性，实现可信的FAS。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

Motivation: 现有结构化状态空间模型在TAD中存在时间上下文衰减、自元素冲突问题，传统方法缺乏全局意识和高效检测头，难以检测长跨度动作实例。

Method: 提出MambaTAD模型，包含对角掩码双向状态空间（DMBSS）模块、全局特征融合头，采用新的状态空间时间适配器（SSTA）以端到端单阶段方式处理TAD。

Result: MambaTAD在多个公共基准上实现了优越的TAD性能。

Conclusion: MambaTAD能有效解决现有方法在TAD中的问题，实现准确的时间动作检测。

Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.

TL;DR: 为解决现有VQualA LMMs问题，提出以视觉编码器为中心的生成式预训练管道，开发VITAL - Series LMMs，构建大量VL对，采用多任务训练，实现高效模型扩展，为VQualA基础LMM奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQualA LMMs专注单任务、依赖全参数微调，易过拟合，限制泛化和迁移能力。

Method: 提出以视觉编码器为中心的生成式预训练管道，采用机器执行的注释审查范式构建超450万VL对，采用多任务训练工作流，基于视觉编码器实现高效模型扩展。

Result: 模型库具有强零样本性能，每个配对解码器用不到1/1000预训练数据快速预热就能达到全训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: 为VQualA基础LMM的发展奠定基石。

Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.

Motivation: 扩散变压器在视觉合成中存在高级语义推理和长期规划不足，导致视觉幻觉和与用户指令不对齐，尤其在复杂场景理解等情况下。

Method: 提出Plan - X框架，核心是语义规划器，从文本提示和视觉上下文推理用户意图，生成时空语义标记，为视频扩散模型提供结构化“语义草图”。

Result: 框架大幅减少视觉幻觉，实现与多模态上下文一致的细粒度、符合指令的视频生成。

Conclusion: Plan - X有效整合语言模型和扩散模型优势，能解决视频生成中语义推理和规划不足问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

Conclusion: IE - Bench和IE - Critic - R1能有效提升文本驱动图像编辑评估质量，相关数据和代码公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.

Conclusion: 层级思维模式对提升多模态大语言模型能力有重要意义且有效。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: SPD框架能更稳健地去偏，同时在任务性能上损失较小，是一种有效的去偏方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.

Motivation: 现有LDCOS方法因目标固有隐藏性和标注稀缺，性能受限，研究能否结合一致性约束和SAM监督并实现相互提升。

Method: 提出SCALER统一协作框架，交替优化均值教师分割器和可学习SAM，分两阶段，阶段一在固定SAM监督下优化分割器，阶段二更新SAM。

Result: SCALER在八个半监督和弱监督COS任务中取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SCALER可作为通用训练范式，在标签稀缺条件下提升轻量级分割器和大型基础模型。

Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.

Result: UnfoldLDM在各种盲图像恢复任务中取得领先地位，且有利于下游任务，设计与现有基于深度展开网络的方法兼容。

Conclusion: UnfoldLDM能有效解决现有深度展开网络在盲图像恢复中的问题，是一个有潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.

Motivation: 现有基于深度展开网络的隐藏对象分割方法将背景估计与图像恢复耦合，有冲突目标且需预定义退化类型，不适合真实场景。

Method: 采用 DUN - in - DUN 设计，将抗退化展开网络 (DeRUN) 嵌入面向分割的展开网络 (SODUN) 各阶段；DeRUN 由视觉语言模型引导，SODUN 进行可逆估计；利用展开的多阶段特性，采用图像质量评估选择 DeRUN 输出并引入自一致性损失。

Result: NUN 在干净和退化基准测试中取得领先地位。

Conclusion: NUN 是用于真实世界隐藏对象分割的有效统一框架。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.

Result: 在四个基准测试中取得SOTA结果，如DocVQA上88.7 ANLS和50.1 mAP。

Conclusion: 通过代理编排专业工具可同时提升性能和可解释性，为可信、可解释的文档AI系统提供途径。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.

Result: 对17个主流T2I模型分析表明，它们在隐式世界知识和物理因果推理能力上普遍存在不同程度的基本局限。

Conclusion: 未来T2I系统需要推理感知、知识整合的架构。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

Method: 引入Uni - DAD单阶段管道，训练时结合双域分布匹配蒸馏目标和多头生成对抗网络损失。

Result: 在多样数据集上评估，Uni - DAD在少于4个采样步骤时质量高于现有方法，在质量和多样性上优于两阶段训练管道。

Conclusion: Uni - DAD能有效解决现有扩散模型在新领域应用的问题，实现快速高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，实现了最先进的重建质量，推理时间仅为近期基于VGGT的大规模重建方法的33%。

Conclusion: SwiftVGGT在减少推理时间的同时能保持高质量的大规模场景3D重建。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.

Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.

Motivation: 明确在小数据集下，使用特定医学数据预训练的模型和通用数据集预训练的模型哪种用于脑肿瘤检测效果更好。

Method: 使用有限大小的脑MRI数据集，在相同条件下对RadImageNet DenseNet121、EfficientNetV2S和ConvNeXt - Tiny三种预训练CNN架构进行训练和微调。

Result: ConvNeXt - Tiny准确率最高，其次是EfficientNetV2S，RadImageNet DenseNet121准确率低、损失高、泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 特定领域预训练在小数据条件下泛化性不佳，大规模数据集预训练的通用CNN在医学影像任务中迁移学习性能更优。

Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.

Motivation: 传统X射线违禁物品检测方法依赖视觉模态，难以应对复杂威胁，现有研究多针对单视图，而实际中常用双视图，探究第二视图能否提供类似语言模态的约束。

Method: 引入DualXrayBench基准，包含含对应说明的45,613对双视图图像；提出GSR模型，联合学习跨视图几何和跨模态语义的对应关系；构建GSXray数据集，含结构化思维链序列。

Result: 在DualXrayBench上的综合评估表明，GSR在所有X射线任务上都取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GSR为现实世界的X射线检查提供了新视角。

Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分体现现实世界文档拍摄条件的复杂挑战，需新基准。

Method: 引入DocPTBench，包含超1300份多领域高分辨率拍摄文档、8种翻译场景及人工验证注释。

Result: 从数字文档过渡到拍摄文档，主流MLLMs端到端解析平均准确率下降18%，翻译下降12%，专业文档解析模型平均下降25%。

Conclusion: 现实条件下拍摄的文档有独特挑战，现有模型鲁棒性有限。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.

Conclusion: UNIFIER能有效解决MLLMs在场景动态变化下的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.

Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.

Abstract: Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: ObjectAlign框架能有效检测、验证和纠正编辑视频序列中的对象级和时间不一致问题。

Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: 研究为未来提升VLM的视觉和语言理解的研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.

Conclusion: Yo'City框架有效可行，能实现用户定制和无限扩展的3D城市生成，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.

Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有多视图异常检测方法将多视图视为独立图像集，导致特征表示不一致和高误报率。

Method: 引入VSAD框架，核心是MVAM模块利用单应性投影和对齐相邻视图特征区域，集成到VALDM中进行渐进式多阶段对齐，FRM模块增强特征全局一致性，通过与正常原型内存库比较进行异常检测。

Result: 在RealIAD和MANTA数据集上显著优于现有方法，在像素、视图和样本级视觉异常检测表现出色。

Conclusion: VSAD框架能有效解决多视图图像无监督视觉异常检测问题，对大视角变化和复杂纹理具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型高分辨率视觉输入导致长序列视觉token和推理延迟，现有视觉token剪枝方法有局限，需为基于混合专家（MoE）的MLLMs开发新的加速框架。

Method: 提出FastMMoE框架，结合专家激活减少和路由感知token剪枝两种策略。

Result: 在DeepSeek - VL2和InternVL3.5等模型上实验，FastMMoE可减少达55.0%的FLOPs，保留约95.5%的原性能，在多保留率下优于FastV和SparseVLM等基线。

Conclusion: FastMMoE是有效的训练无关加速框架，能在降低计算量的同时保持性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.

Result: Re - CatVTON比前代模型性能显著提升，FID、KID和LPIPS分数提高，SSIM仅略微下降。

Conclusion: Re - CatVTON为单UNet虚拟试穿模型建立了新的效率 - 性能权衡。

Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.

Conclusion: ConceptGuard是一种有效的多模态视频生成安全防护框架，能主动检测和缓解不安全语义。

Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.

Conclusion: FlowSteer方法能有效挖掘基于ReFlow的蒸馏潜力，解决相关问题提升性能。

Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.

Result: 在不同器官的肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，FedOAP始终优于现有的联邦和个性化分割方法。

Conclusion: FedOAP是一种有效的多器官肿瘤分割的个性化联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论

Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.

TL;DR: 提出AdaPerceiver，首个在深度、宽度和标记上具有统一适应性的变压器架构，评估显示其在多任务上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代变压器架构在推理时计算分配缺乏灵活性，现有动态计算方法多关注单一维度，需适应不同硬件和延迟约束。

Method: 提出支持多轴适应性的架构，并采用高效联合训练机制。

Result: 在图像分类上扩展了准确率 - 吞吐量帕累托前沿；在密集预测上匹配ViT - H/14且减少大量FLOPs；配备策略可保持准确率并减少FLOPs。

Conclusion: AdaPerceiver在多任务中展现出良好的适应性和计算效率。

Abstract: Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.

TL;DR: 提出MetaDCSeg框架解决医学图像分割中注释噪声和边界模糊问题，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以缓解注释噪声对医学图像分割性能的影响，尤其是边界区域。

Method: 提出MetaDCSeg框架，通过动态中心距离（DCD）机制显式建模边界不确定性，利用加权特征距离引导模型关注难分割像素。

Result: 在四个不同噪声水平的基准数据集上进行广泛实验，MetaDCSeg始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MetaDCSeg能有效抑制噪声标签影响，精确处理结构边界，显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BPGO扩展GRPO，在图像和视频生成任务上表现优于GRPO及变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO性能受文本视觉对应模糊性限制，奖励模型信号不确定，导致GRPO利用反馈不佳和过拟合。

Method: 引入BPGO，通过语义先验锚点建模奖励不确定性，在组间和组内两个层面自适应调节优化信任。

Result: 在图像和视频生成任务中，BPGO语义对齐更强、感知保真度更高、收敛更快。

Conclusion: BPGO是GRPO的有效扩展，能改善其性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.

Motivation: 现有基于PlantVillage数据集的植物病害分类模型难以泛化到真实场景，需解决此问题。

Method: 评估卷积神经网络、视觉Transformer和基于CLIP的零样本模型。

Result: CNN在领域转移下鲁棒性有限，视觉Transformer泛化能力强，CLIP模型无需特定训练，适应性和可解释性好。

Conclusion: 零样本学习可作为植物健康诊断在不同田间环境的实用且可扩展的领域适应策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.

Motivation: 现有BIQA方法融合浅层和深层特征时忽视其对质量预测的不同贡献，且有效质量解码架构探索不足。

Method: 提出Life - IQA框架，包含GCN增强的层交互模块（用GCN增强的最深层特征作查询，倒数第二层特征作键和值进行交叉注意力）和基于MoE的特征解耦模块（通过特定专家解耦融合表示）。

Result: Life - IQA在精度和成本间比普通Transformer解码器有更好平衡，在多个BIQA基准测试中达SOTA。

Conclusion: 所提Life - IQA框架有效，能在BIQA中取得良好效果。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.

Motivation: 准确快速评估冲突地区损伤对人道主义援助和地区稳定至关重要，但冲突地区数据有限、标注难、识别挑战大。

Method: 引入预训练DINOv3模型，提出MC - DiSNet网络，发布Gaza - change数据集，提出CSD任务。

Result: 在Gaza - Change和SECOND数据集上实验，方法能有效解决CSD任务。

Conclusion: 所提方法表现出色，为冲突地区快速损伤评估的实际应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.

Motivation: 手动分割脑血管耗时且易有差异，现有自动方法常牺牲准确性，此前多基于TOF - MRA，需从临床标准T1CE MRI直接分割脑血管的方法。

Method: 构建基于扩张U - Net的NeuroVascU - Net，集成MSC²F和CDA²F模块，在137例脑肿瘤活检患者T1CE扫描数据集上训练验证。

Result: Dice分数达0.8609，精度达0.8841，能准确分割主要和细微血管结构，仅需1240万个参数，远少于基于Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: NeuroVascU - Net平衡了准确性和效率，是计算机辅助神经外科规划的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3.

Motivation: MeanFlow虽能少步高质量生成模型，但训练动力学不明，需深入分析。

Method: 分析两种速度间的相互作用，设计先加速瞬时速度形成，再从短间隔平均速度过渡到长间隔平均速度的训练方案。

Result: 增强的MeanFlow训练收敛更快，少步生成效果显著提升，如在1 - NFE ImageNet 256x256上FID达2.87，或用更短时间、更小骨干网络达到基线性能。

Conclusion: 所提训练方案能有效优化MeanFlow训练，提升生成性能。

Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.

Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.

Result: YOLO检测器对九类服装的平均精度均值（mAP@0.5）达0.71；RAG - LLM管道生成的字幕与属性对齐，标签生成的平均属性覆盖率为0.80；BLIP词汇重叠度高、泛化性低。

Conclusion: 检索增强生成是用于自动且基于视觉的时尚内容生成的有效且可解释的范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.

Result: ViT在各数据集和疾病检测中准确率为0.789 - 0.843，几何和颜色增强效果稳定，直方图均衡化对特定数据集有益，拉普拉斯增强降低性能；在Papila数据集上带几何增强的ViT的AUC达0.91，超之前卷积集成基线；异常检测器AUC达0.76。

Conclusion: Transformer架构和多数据集训练有优势，异常检测器有可解释性和泛化能力，概率校准可支持未来临床应用。

Abstract: Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.
  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.

Result: 分析显示现有模型在识别跨模态冲突有很大局限，存在系统性模态偏差和特定类别弱点。

Conclusion: 在CLASH上进行针对性微调能大幅提升冲突检测能力。

Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity. Our code and data are publicly released here: https://thrcle421.github.io/DiT-Mem-Web/.

Motivation: 现实图像识别有大量噪声干扰，现有抗噪声方法性能达瓶颈，缺乏从神经元角度探索抗干扰方案。

Method: 提出抗噪声神经元卷积，模仿神经元树突结构，将树突邻域交互计算逻辑融入卷积运算底层设计，通过输入特征间非线性交互模拟生物树突异或逻辑预处理功能。

Conclusion: 该卷积的计算方法与生物神经元树突一致，在复杂噪声环境下比传统卷积表现更好。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.

Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.

Conclusion: 指出了现有方法的不足，为未来研究揭示关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.

Conclusion: 深度集成模型是值得信赖和可解释的平台，可作为可靠临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升像素扩散效率和性能，缩小与潜在扩散方法差距。

Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将明确临床背景嵌入肿瘤分期分类，方法性能先进且决策透明。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.

Conclusion: In - Video Instruction范式有效，可用于可控图像到视频生成。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: CoMA框架有效解决了单一基础模型在源自由域适应中的局限性，提高了适应性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.

Conclusion: 紧凑的连续视觉思维能实现更精确、可靠和可解释的多模态智能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.

Abstract: Achieving consensus among noncooperative agents remains challenging in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents often have conflicting preferences. Existing coordination methods enable agents to reach consensus without a centralized coordinator, but do not provide formal guarantees on system-level objectives such as efficiency or fairness. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative negotiation and oversight framework that augments a decentralized negotiation mechanism with taxation-like oversight. The framework builds upon the trading auction for consensus, enabling noncooperative agents with conflicting preferences to negotiate through asset trading while preserving valuation privacy. We introduce an oversight mechanism, which implements a taxation-like intervention that guides decentralized negotiation toward system-efficient and equitable outcomes while also regulating how fast the framework converges. We establish theoretical guarantees of finite-time termination and derive bounds linking system efficiency and convergence rate to the level of central intervention. A case study based on the collaborative trajectory options program, a rerouting initiative in U.S. air traffic management, demonstrates that the framework can reliably achieve consensus among noncooperative airspace sector managers, and reveals how the level of intervention regulates the relationship between system efficiency and convergence speed. Taken together, the theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed framework provides a general mechanism for decentralized coordination in noncooperative multi-agent systems while safeguarding system-level objectives.

Result: 实现O(n)通信复杂度，模拟环境实验中共识收敛时通信开销降低99.9%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能通过分层升级和动态适应，确保各种复杂任务的共识收敛。

Abstract: The consensus strategies used in collaborative multi-agent systems (MAS) face notable challenges related to adaptability, scalability, and convergence certainties. These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.

Abstract: As foundation models are increasingly deployed as interacting agents in multi-agent systems, their collective behavior raises new challenges for trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Conflict resolution and consensus building represent critical challenges in multi-agent systems, negotiations, and collaborative decision-making processes. This paper introduces Dialogue Diplomats, a novel end-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed for automated conflict resolution and consensus building in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.

Method: 进行72种不同配置的系统仿真实验，引入Object Memory Management (OMM)机制，维护分布式黑名单辅助路径重计算。

Conclusion: 持久共享记忆对动态环境中的多智能体协调至关重要，研究结果对机器人、网络路由和分布式AI等领域有启示。

Abstract: Multi-agent coordination is critical for next-generation autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, yet naive implementations of communication-based rerouting can lead to catastrophic performance degradation. This study investigates a fundamental problem in decentralized multi-agent navigation: routing loops, where vehicles without persistent obstacle memory become trapped in cycles of inefficient path recalculation. Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments. The findings have implications beyond autonomous vehicles, informing the design of decentralized systems in robotics, network routing, and distributed AI. We provide a comprehensive experimental analysis, including detailed scenario breakdowns, scalability assessments, and visual documentation of the routing loop phenomenon, demonstrating OMM's critical role in preventing detrimental feedback cycles in cooperative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The adaptation of teaching slides to instructors' situated teaching needs, including pedagogical styles and their students' context, is a critical yet time-consuming task for educators. Through a series of educator interviews, we first identify and systematically categorize the key friction points that impede this adaptation process. Grounded in these findings, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to automate slide adaptation based on high-level instructor specifications. An evaluation involving 16 modification requests across 8 real-world courses validates our approach. The framework's output consistently achieved high scores in intent alignment, content coherence and factual accuracy, and performed on par with baseline methods regarding visual clarity, while also demonstrating appropriate timeliness and a high operational agreement with human experts, achieving an F1 score of 0.89. This work heralds a new paradigm where AI agents handle the logistical burdens of instructional design, liberating educators to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of teaching.

Conclusion: 完成了混合分数过程的粗糙路径基础，可应用于随机分析等领域。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive theory of geometric rough paths for mixed fractional Brownian motion (MFBM) and its generalized multi-component extensions. We prove that for a generalized MFBM of the form $M_t^H(a) = \sum_{k=1}^N a_k B_t^{H_k}$ with $\min\{H_k\} > \frac{1}{4}$, there exists a canonical geometric rough path obtained as the limit of smooth rough paths associated with dyadic approximations. This extends the classical result of Coutin and Qian \cite{coutin2002} for single fractional Brownian motion to the mixed case.
  We provide explicit bounds on the $p$-variation norms and establish a Skorohod integral representation connecting our pathwise construction to the Malliavin calculus framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications to rough differential equations driven by MFBM, enabling the use of Lyons' universal limit theorem for this class of processes. Finally, we study the signature of MFBM paths, providing a complete algebraic characterization of their geometric properties.
  Our approach unifies the treatment of multiple fractional components and reveals the fundamental interactions between different regularity scales, completing the rough path foundation for mixed fractional processes with applications in stochastic analysis and beyond.

Conclusion: 该统一模型能有效分析不同图上的进化动力学，可近似计算固定概率。

Abstract: We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $λ$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $λ\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $λ=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $λ=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are "almost regular," in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $Ω_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\{d_1, d_2\}$ with $d_1 \leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $λ$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 α^4)$ for all $λ$, where $α= d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $λ$.

Motivation: 大语言模型及其代理系统应用于大规模固件时，因固件二进制特性、复杂依赖结构和异构组件导致性能下降，需解决此挑战。

Method: 提出FIRMHIVE，引入将委托转化为每个代理可执行原语和构建运行时代理树进行去中心化协调两个关键机制。

Result: 与现有大语言模型代理基线相比，FIRMHIVE交叉文件探索更深更广，每个固件产生约5.6倍的警报；与先进安全工具相比，识别出约1.5倍的漏洞，精度达71%。

Conclusion: FIRMHIVE在固件安全分析的产量和保真度上有显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agent systems have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating code reasoning and vulnerability detection. However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.

Abstract: The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.

Result: CUP攻击成功率高，影响跨多个任务持续存在。

Conclusion: CUP对多用户大语言模型部署构成根本风险，基于任务聚类的防御可缓解此新类漏洞。

Abstract: Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability

Motivation: AI代理自主行动引发透明度和控制问题，传统权限模型不适用于自动化执行范式，需提供有效用户控制。

Method: 进行用户研究确定影响用户权限决策的因素，将其编码到基于机器学习的权限管理助手以预测用户未来决策。

Result: 参与者权限决策受通信上下文影响，个体偏好上下文内一致且与他人一致；权限预测模型总体准确率85.1%，高置信度预测94.4%；不使用权限历史准确率66.9%，少量增加训练样本可提升准确率10.8%。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动化权限管理可行，构建的模型能较好预测用户权限决策。

Abstract: As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.

However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.

Motivation: 大语言模型驱动的多智能体系统在带来软件开发便利的同时引入了未被充分探索的安全风险。

Method: 识别MU - BA和BU - MA两种风险场景，提出IMBIA攻击和Adv - IMBIA防御机制，在多个框架进行评估。

Result: IMBIA在不同场景有不同攻击成功率，防御机制显著降低攻击成功率，发现编码和测试阶段受影响智能体风险大。

Conclusion: 多智能体软件开发系统迫切需要强大的安全措施，并给出针对性防御策略的实用指南。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.

TL;DR: 提出FHE - Agent框架自动化FHE中CKKS方案配置，经实验验证其性能优于传统策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FHE的CKKS方案实际部署依赖专业知识，现有编译器配置有局限性。

Method: 将LLM控制器与确定性工具套件结合，分解搜索过程，采用多保真度工作流。

Result: 在标准基准和深层架构上评估，比简单搜索策略精度更高、延迟更低，能为复杂模型找到可行配置。

Conclusion: FHE - Agent框架可有效解决FHE中CKKS方案配置难题。

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.
  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.
  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.

TL;DR: 提出ADALOC方法使基于密钥的模型使用控制在模型演变中具有适应性，实验证明其在更新时能保持高精度和强保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型使用控制方法难以承受模型持续更新，需一种在模型演变中仍具适应性的控制机制。

Method: 战略性选择部分权重作为内在访问密钥，使模型更新局限于该密钥，可恢复模型到最新授权状态且无需重新密钥。

Result: 在标准基准和现代架构实验中，授权使用有强性能，未授权使用准确率降至接近随机猜测水平。

Conclusion: ADALOC能为现实场景中自适应和受保护的DNN部署提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出适用于相关序列数据的相关序列差分隐私（CSDP）框架，构建FRAN机制，测试显示CSDP在隐私 - 效用权衡上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源数据流存在相关性，违反多数差分隐私机制的记录独立性假设，需在不牺牲效用的前提下恢复严格隐私保证。

Method: 将多变量流建模为耦合马尔可夫链，得出泄漏边界，构建FRAN机制。

Result: CSDP在两序列数据集测试中，相比现有相关差分隐私方法在隐私 - 效用权衡上提升约50%，比标准差分隐私方法提升两个数量级。

Conclusion: CSDP框架能有效解决相关序列数据的隐私保护问题，在隐私 - 效用权衡上表现更优。

Abstract: Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.

Motivation: ABAC访问策略数量和复杂性增加，制定和评估困难，需合成简洁准确的策略。

Method: 评估Google Gemini和OpenAI ChatGPT等LLMs，用Python开发实验框架生成随机访问数据，用标准指标评估LLM生成的策略。

Result: LLMs在小规模场景能有效推断紧凑有效的ABAC策略，系统规模增大时，准确性和精度下降，策略规模超出最优值。

Conclusion: 当前LLM架构用于访问控制领域可扩展策略挖掘有前景也有局限，未来探索结合提示优化和经典规则挖掘算法的混合方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.

Conclusion: MMed - RAG系统存在关键漏洞，安全关键医疗应用需进行鲁棒性基准测试。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.
  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.

Abstract: In finance, predictive models must balance accuracy and interpretability, particularly in credit risk assessment, where model decisions carry material consequences. We present a quantum neural network (QNN) based on a single qudit, in which both data features and trainable parameters are co-encoded within a unified unitary evolution generated by the full Lie algebra. This design explores the entire Hilbert space while enabling interpretability through the magnitudes of the learned coefficients. We benchmark our model on a real-world, imbalanced credit-risk dataset from Taiwan. The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.

Conclusion: 理论有助于QNEs在测量相对熵上的原则性实现和超参数调整。

Abstract: Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.

Conclusion: StableUASim为系统设计和机器学习驱动的水下应用提供可扩展、数据高效且物理一致的替代模型。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of time-varying underwater acoustic channels is essential for the design, evaluation, and deployment of reliable underwater communication systems. Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.

Motivation: 现有INR框架假设全局平稳谱基，与现实信号频率特征空间变化大的特性不符。

Method: 引入可学习的频率传输方程，通过空间调制一组紧凑的全局正弦基来重建信号。

Result: 在2D图像回归、音频重建和隐式3D几何实验中，NSTR在精度 - 参数权衡上显著优于SIREN、Fourier - feature MLPs和Instant - NGP，所需全局频率更少、收敛更快。

Conclusion: NSTR通过显式建模空间变化频谱为INR研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, audio, and 3D scenes. However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_θ$ enforcing $\nabla S(x) \approx F_θ(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields. We believe NSTR opens a new direction in INR research by introducing explicit modeling of space-varying spectrum.

The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.

Experiments on the ICASSP 2026 SongEval benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across correlation and top-tier metrics.

Motivation: 音频分类器常面临领域偏移问题，以往TTA研究评估模型的噪声设置不能模拟现实变化，需更真实的评估基准。

Method: 提出DHAuDS基准，包含四个标准化基准，设置动态腐败严重程度和异构噪声类型，定义多个评估标准。

Conclusion: DHAuDS通过动态和混合域噪声设置，为鲁棒和自适应音频建模研究提供一致且可公开复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Audio classifiers frequently face domain shift, when models trained on one dataset lose accuracy on data recorded in acoustically different conditions. Previous Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) research in speech and sound analysis often evaluates models under fixed or mismatched noise settings, that fail to mimic real-world variability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents DHAuDS (Dynamic and Heterogeneous Audio Domain Shift), a benchmark designed to assess TTA approaches under more realistic and diverse acoustic shifts. DHAuDS comprises four standardized benchmarks: UrbanSound8K-C, SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C, and ReefSet-C, each constructed with dynamic corruption severity levels and heterogeneous noise types to simulate authentic audio degradation scenarios. The framework defines 14 evaluation criteria for each benchmark (8 for UrbanSound8K-C), resulting in 50 unrepeated criteria (124 experiments) that collectively enable fair, reproducible, and cross-domain comparison of TTA algorithms. Through the inclusion of dynamic and mixed-domain noise settings, DHAuDS offers a consistent and publicly reproducible testbed to support ongoing studies in robust and adaptive audio modeling.

Abstract: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.

Result: 客观评估表明该方法能有效调节调性张力，主观听力测试证实输出符合目标张力，且能在相同张力条件下生成多种不同音乐诠释。

Conclusion: 通过两级波束搜索进行显式张力调节为引导AI生成音乐提供了强大且直观的工具。

Abstract: State-of-the-art symbolic music generation models have recently achieved remarkable output quality, yet explicit control over compositional features, such as tonal tension, remains challenging. We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.

Abstract: Advances in object tracking and acoustic beamforming are driving new capabilities in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics. This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments. The approach combines single-camera depth estimation and stereo vision to enable accurate 3D localization of moving objects. A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies.

Abstract: We present a meshless method for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in advection-dominated regimes using physics- and equality-constrained artificial neural networks combined with a conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian formulation. A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.

Abstract: We develop an arbitrage-free deep learning framework for yield curve and bond price forecasting based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) term-structure model and a dynamic Nelson-Siegel parameterization of forward rates. Our approach embeds a no-arbitrage drift restriction into a neural state-space architecture by combining Kalman, extended Kalman, and particle filters with recurrent neural networks (LSTM/CLSTM), and introduces an explicit arbitrage error regularization (AER) term during training. The model is applied to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, and its performance is evaluated for both yield-space and price-space predictions at 1-day and 5-day horizons. Empirically, arbitrage regularization leads to its strongest improvements at short maturities, particularly in 5-day-ahead forecasts, increasing market-consistency as measured by bid-ask hit rates and reducing dollar-denominated prediction errors.

Abstract: Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: By observing the activities and relationships of musicians and sound designers to the activities of creation, performance, publishing and dissemination with artificial intelligence (AI), from two specialized forums between 2022 and 2024, this article proposes a lexicometric analysis of the representations linked to their use. Indeed, the machine, now equipped with artificial intelligences requiring new appropriations and enabling new mediations, constitutes new challenges for artists. To study these confrontations and new mediations, our approach mobilizes the theoretical framework of the Human-AI Musicking Framework, based on a lexicometric analysis of content. The aim is to clarify the present and future uses of AI from the interfaces, in the creation of sound and musical content, and to identify the obstacles, obstacles, brakes and limits to appropriation ``in the fact of making the content one's own and integrating it as a part of oneself'' (Bachimont and Crozat, 2004) in the context of a collaboration between musician and machine.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration outcomes depend strongly on human self-confidence calibration, which drives reliance or resistance toward AI's suggestions. This work presents two studies examining whether calibration of self-confidence before decision tasks, low versus high levels of Need for Cognition (NFC), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), leads to differences in decision accuracy, self-confidence appropriateness during the tasks, and metacognitive perceptions (global and affective). The first study presents strategies to identify well-calibrated users, also comparing decision accuracy and the appropriateness of self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels. The second study investigates the effects of calibrated self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making (no AI, two-stage AI, and personalized AI), also considering different NFC and AOT levels. Our results show the importance of human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits when designing AI-assisted decision systems. We further propose design recommendations to address the challenge of calibrating self-confidence and supporting tailored, user-centric AI that accounts for individual traits.

Abstract: To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.

Motivation: 当前系统分析教学缺乏系统方法来教导负责任AI编排，学生存在盲目接受AI建议的风险。

Method: 将GenAI嵌入课程设计形成SAGE方法，并在四所澳大利亚大学的18个学生小组中实施。

Result: 多数小组超越被动接受，学生编排技能有发展，但存在能力上限，如无法主动识别分析中的差距；不同能力表现有相关性；学生在识别AI错误方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 教育者应要求学生记录决策原因，在各开发阶段嵌入可访问性提示，让学生先自行创建规范再与AI生成版本对比。

Abstract: Systems analysis students increasingly use Generative AI, yet current pedagogy lacks systematic approaches for teaching responsible AI orchestration that fosters critical thinking whilst meeting educational outcomes. Students risk accepting AI suggestions blindly or uncritically without assessing alignment with user needs or contextual appropriateness. SAGE (Structured AI-Guided Education) addresses this gap by embedding GenAI into curriculum design, training students when to accept, modify, or reject AI contributions. Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations. Accessibility awareness proved fragile. When writing requirements, 85\% of groups explicitly considered elderly users and cultural needs. Notably, 55\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.

Abstract: Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p < .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.

Abstract: Digital health interventions are increasingly used in physical and occupational therapy to deliver home exercise programs via sensor equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician directed intervention software generation with LLMs in healthcare, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials to assess clinical effectiveness and safety in real patient populations.

Motivation: 研究模拟网络中是否存在双重下降现象，以及模拟物理系统能否展现数字AI成功的底层行为。

Method: 在自调节电阻元件的去中心化模拟网络中进行实验，先采用标准训练，后采用修改后的训练协议。

Result: 标准训练无法产生双重下降，修改后的训练协议成功实现双重下降。

Conclusion: 模拟物理系统经适当训练可展现数字AI成功的底层行为，生物系统可能从过参数化中受益。

Abstract: An important component of the success of large AI models is double descent, in which networks avoid overfitting as they grow relative to the amount of training data, instead improving their performance on unseen data. Here we demonstrate double descent in a decentralized analog network of self-adjusting resistive elements. This system trains itself and performs tasks without a digital processor, offering potential gains in energy efficiency and speed -- but must endure component non-idealities. We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds. Our findings show that analog physical systems, if appropriately trained, can exhibit behaviors underlying the success of digital AI. Further, they suggest that biological systems might similarly benefit from over-parameterization.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space. MOCLIP employs contrastive learning to align geometry and spectral representations using an experimentally acquired dataset with a sample density comparable to ImageNet-1K. The study demonstrates MOCLIP inverse design capabilities for high-throughput zero-shot prediction at a rate of 0.2 million samples per second, enabling the design of a full 4-inch wafer populated with high-density metasurfaces in minutes. It also shows generative latent-space optimization reaching 97 percent accuracy. Finally, we introduce an optical information storage concept that uses MOCLIP to achieve a density of 0.1 Gbit per square millimeter at the resolution limit, exceeding commercial optical media by a factor of six. These results position MOCLIP as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications.

TL;DR: 提出HDDB，结合HDC与FeNAND MLC进行存储内SQL谓词评估和分析，实验显示其有低延迟和低能耗优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDC特性适合SQL数据库工作负载，且其容错性与FeNAND匹配，希望解决大规模事实表低能耗低延迟需求及FeNAND高误码率问题。

Method: 提出硬件 - 软件协同设计HDDB，引入新HDC编码技术，将谓词过滤和聚合转化为高效HDC操作。

Result: 在TPC - DS事实表实验中，HDDB相比传统CPU/GPU SQL数据库引擎，延迟降低达80.6倍，能耗降低达12,636倍。

Conclusion: HDDB为抗噪、以内存为中心的数据库处理提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) encodes information and data into high-dimensional distributed vectors that can be manipulated using simple bitwise operations and similarity searches, offering parallelism, low-precision hardware friendliness, and strong robustness to noise. These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads. Experiments on TPC-DS fact tables show that HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines, suggesting that HDDB provides a practical substrate for noise-robust, memory-centric database processing.

Conclusion: 联合优化收缩路径、硬件架构和数据流映射可提高边缘平台上张量化神经网络的部署效率。

Abstract: High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4 and 3.85 lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.

Motivation: 不清楚裸盖菇素引起的大脑连接变化如何在脑电图（EEG）和功能磁共振成像（fMRI）网络中体现，需分析两者连接性。

Method: 构建具有偏相关边和皮尔逊分布节点特征的图，通过图卷积学习主题级嵌入，用自适应softmax门以特定样本权重融合模态。

Result: 使用PsiConnect数据集，Brain - MGF区分裸盖菇素和无裸盖菇素条件，融合效果优于单模态和非自适应变体，冥想时准确率74.0%、F1分数76.5%，休息时准确率76.0%、ROC - AUC为85.8%，UMAP可视化显示融合嵌入类分离更清晰。

Conclusion: 自适应图融合能有效整合EEG - fMRI互补信息，为表征裸盖菇素引起的大规模神经组织变化提供可解释框架。

Abstract: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在处理含潜在组结构的线性面板数据模型推断问题上有效且有优势。

Abstract: This paper presents robust inference methods for general linear hypotheses in linear panel data models with latent group structure in the coefficients. We employ a selective conditional inference approach, deriving the conditional distribution of coefficient estimates given the group structure estimated from the data. Our procedure provides valid inference under possible violations of group separation, where distributional properties of group-specific coefficients remain unestablished. Furthermore, even when group separation does hold, our method demonstrates superior finite-sample properties compared to traditional asymptotic approaches. This improvement stems from our procedure's ability to account for statistical uncertainty in the estimation of group structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through Monte Carlo simulations and apply the methods to two datasets on: (i) the relationship between income and democracy, and (ii) the cyclicality of firm-level R&D investment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原最大得分估计器使用指示函数，优化困难，且无法应用于MISC条件框架。

Method: 使用ReLU函数编码符号对齐限制，提出ReLU最大得分（RMS）估计器；将RMS进一步重新表述为DNN架构中的特殊层来构建替代估计器。

Result: RMS估计器收敛率为$n^{-s/(2s+1)}$，具有渐近正态性；可通过DNN软硬件实现估计过程。

Conclusion: 提出的RMS估计器优化更简单，能推广到MISC条件框架，且可借助DNN实现估计。

Abstract: We propose a new formulation of the maximum score estimator that uses compositions of rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions, instead of indicator functions as in Manski (1975,1985), to encode the sign alignment restrictions. Since the ReLU function is Lipschitz, our new ReLU-based maximum score criterion function is substantially easier to optimize using standard gradient-based optimization pacakges. We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness. In addition, we propose an alternative estimator using a further reformulation of RMS as a special layer in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which allows the estimation procedure to be implemented via state-of-the-art software and hardware for DNN.

Conclusion: 完整策略空间解锁合作隐藏途径，强调解释合作出现时综合建模的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists is a central challenge in evolutionary game theory. Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation.

Abstract: Benthic habitat is challenging due to the environmental complexity of the seafloor, technological limitations, and elevated operational costs, especially in under-explored regions. This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.

Conclusion: DM可作为EM的替代方案用于稳健潜在结构推理。

Abstract: We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.

Abstract: We study the problem of matching correlated VAR time series databases, where a multivariate time series is observed along with a perturbed and permuted version, and the goal is to recover the unknown matching between them. To model this, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which two time series $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are jointly generated, such that $x^\#_t=x_{π^*(t)}+σ\tilde{x}_{π^*(t)}$, where $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(\tilde{x}_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are independent and identically distributed vector autoregressive (VAR) time series of order $1$ with Gaussian increments, for a hidden $π^*$. The objective is to recover $π^*$, from the observation of $(x_t)_{t\in[T]},(x^\#_t)_{t\in[T]}$. This generalizes the classical problem of matching independent point clouds to the time series setting.
  We derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to a quadratic optimization over permutations, and theoretically analyze an estimator based on linear assignment. For the latter approach, we establish recovery guarantees, identifying thresholds for $σ$ that allow for perfect or partial recovery. Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope). This allows for efficient estimation of $π^*$ and the VAR parameters via alternating minimization. Empirically, we find that linear assignment often matches or outperforms MLE relaxation based approaches.

Abstract: We consider the problem of joint estimation of the parameters of $m$ linear dynamical systems, given access to single realizations of their respective trajectories, each of length $T$. The linear systems are assumed to reside on the nodes of an undirected and connected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$, and the system matrices are assumed to either vary smoothly or exhibit small number of ``jumps'' across the edges. We consider a total variation penalized least-squares estimator and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) which hold with high probability. In particular, the bounds imply for certain choices of well connected $G$ that the MSE goes to zero as $m$ increases, even when $T$ is constant. The theoretical results are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.
  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) become pervasive, addressing gender disparities and diversity gaps in their workforce is urgent. These rapidly evolving fields have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected women and minorities, exposing deep-seated inequalities. Both academia and industry shape these disciplines, making it essential to map disparities across sectors, occupations, and skill levels. The dominance of men in AI and DS reinforces gender biases in machine learning systems, creating a feedback loop of inequality. This imbalance is a matter of social and economic justice and an ethical challenge, demanding value-driven diversity. Root causes include unequal access to education, disparities in academic programs, limited government investments, and underrepresented communities' perceptions of elite opportunities. This chapter examines the participation of women and minorities in AI and DS, focusing on their representation in both industry and academia. Analyzing the existing dynamics seeks to uncover the collective and individual impacts on the lives of women and minority groups within these fields. Additionally, the chapter aims to propose actionable strategies to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion (DEI), fostering a more representative and supportive environment for all.

Motivation: 探索比特币的价值形成机制。

Method: 运用Granular Interaction Thinking Theory - Value Theory (GITT - VT)理论，使用2022 - 2025年的每日数据估计贝叶斯线性模型，对四个信息价值维度进行操作化分析。

Result: SSV对次日回报有高可信正向影响；SOV和AUT有适度可靠正向关联；HSV无可信预测效果。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了跨学科价值理论，表明比特币是双层熵调节的社会 - 技术生态系统，研究结果对数字资产估值、投资教育和非现金流数字资产熵动态研究有启示。

Abstract: This study explores Bitcoin's value formation through the Granular Interaction Thinking Theory-Value Theory (GITT-VT). Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets.

Abstract: In recent times, discussions on social media platforms have increasingly come under scrutiny due to the proliferation of science denial and fake news. Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型使复杂虚假新闻增多，需理解不同文化背景下人类检测虚假新闻的能力。

Method: 对89名参与者（56名南非人，33名其他国籍）进行调查，让他们评估10篇真实南非新闻和10篇AI生成的虚假新闻。

Result: 南非人检测本国真实新闻表现更好，但检测虚假新闻表现更差；南非人判断可信度更依赖内容知识和情境理解，其他国家参与者更强调语法和结构等语言特征；两组偏离理想评分相近。

Conclusion: 文化熟悉度有助于验证真实信息，但评估虚假内容时可能引入偏差，研究有助于理解跨文化误信息检测并为应对策略提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how cultural proximity affects the ability to detect AI-generated fake news by comparing South African participants with those from other nationalities. As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries.

Abstract: Mastering one or more programming languages has historically been the gateway to implementing ideas on a computer. Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.
  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?
  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.

Conclusion: 贡献了人机共创的自我改进框架和两部图像小说，促进AI素养和对话。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Creative Intelligence Loop (CIL), a novel socio-technical framework for responsible human-AI co-creation. Rooted in the 'Workflow as Medium' paradigm, the CIL proposes a disciplined structure for dynamic human-AI collaboration, guiding the strategic integration of diverse AI teammates who function as collaborators while the human remains the final arbiter for ethical alignment and creative integrity. The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks. This work contributes a self-improving framework for responsible human-AI co-creation and two graphic novellas designed to foster AI literacy and dialogue through accessible narrative analysis of AI's societal implications.

Abstract: This research full paper presents an enhancement pipeline for large language models (LLMs) in assessing homework for an undergraduate circuit analysis course, aiming to improve LLMs' capacity to provide personalized support to electrical engineering students. Existing evaluations have demonstrated that GPT-4o possesses promising capabilities in assessing student homework in this domain. Building on these findings, we enhance GPT-4o's performance through multi-step prompting, contextual data augmentation, and the incorporation of targeted hints. These strategies effectively address common errors observed in GPT-4o's responses when using simple prompts, leading to a substantial improvement in assessment accuracy. Specifically, the correct response rate for GPT-4o increases from 74.71% to 97.70% after applying the enhanced prompting and augmented data on entry-level circuit analysis topics. This work lays a foundation for the effective integration of LLMs into circuit analysis instruction and, more broadly, into engineering education.

Motivation: 公共卫生机构在有限资源下识别儿童铅暴露高风险社区面临挑战，需优化资源分配，评估LLMs分配公共卫生资源的有效性。

Method: 开发优先级分数，让LLMs根据社区脆弱性指标在各城市分配1000个测试包。

Result: LLMs常忽视高铅暴露率和大量未测试儿童的社区，资源分配不合理，整体准确率平均0.46，ChatGPT 5 Deep Research最高达0.66。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs宣称有深度研究能力，但在信息检索和基于证据的推理方面存在根本局限，常引用过时数据，非实证叙述会凌驾于定量脆弱性指标之上。

Abstract: Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.

Result: 实现了初步框架，结果令人鼓舞。

Conclusion: 模拟驱动研究可作为未来粒子探测器更先进、数据驱动的DQM系统的基础。

Abstract: Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.

Abstract: The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.

Method: 采用联合和单扩散变压器层，标准化指令 - 音素输入格式，在大量语音和音乐数据上训练。

Result: 与主流TTS和TTM模型对比，InstructAudio在多数指标上取得最优结果。

Conclusion: InstructAudio是首个统一语音和音乐生成的指令控制框架。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

Motivation: 在人工智能助力聚变能源商业化背景下，需要快速准确求解磁约束核聚变中的Grad - Shafranov方程，传统数值求解器计算成本高，数据驱动代理模型无法保证物理一致性和泛化性。

Method: 提出PINO直接学习GSE解算子；对比五种神经架构；采用无监督训练嵌入基于物理的损失项；进行半监督学习结合稀疏标记数据和物理约束；用TensorRT优化加速。

Result: Transformer - KAN神经算子TKNO在监督训练下精度最高；无监督训练使物理残差降低近四个数量级；半监督学习达到最优平衡，插值和外推性能好；模型经优化可实现毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: PINO为下一代聚变控制系统提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.

Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).

Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.

Abstract: Designing new protein structures is fundamental to computational biology, enabling advances in therapeutic molecule discovery and enzyme engineering. Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.

Conclusion: 重建大脑感知的内容而非分类内容是基于EEG的图像生成的关键。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based generative models has enabled high-quality image synthesis conditioned on diverse modalities. Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation.

Abstract: Satellite-based radar retrieval methods are widely employed to fill coverage gaps in ground-based radar systems, especially in remote areas affected by terrain blockage and limited detection range. Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication and millimeter wave (mmWave) have emerged as pivotal technologies for 6G networks. However, the narrow nature of mmWave beams requires precise alignments that typically necessitate large training overhead. This overhead can be reduced by incorporating the position information with beam adjustments. This letter proposes a lightweight autorencoder (LAE) model that addresses the position-assisted beam prediction problem while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to the conventional baseline method, i.e., deep fully connected neural network. The proposed LAE is designed as a three-layer undercomplete network to exploit its dimensionality reduction capabilities and thereby mitigate the computational requirements of the trained model. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.

Conclusion: 量化了可靠性 - 性能权衡，为生产AI基础设施提供部署指导。

Abstract: Deep learning training relies on periodic checkpoints to recover from failures, but unsafe checkpoint installation can leave corrupted files on disk. This paper presents an experimental study of checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation for AI training on macOS/APFS. We implement three write modes with increasing durability guarantees: unsafe (baseline, no fsync), atomic_nodirsync (file-level durability via fsync()), and atomic_dirsync (file + directory durability). We design a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with automatic rollback. Through controlled experiments including crash injection (430 unsafe-mode trials) and corruption injection (1,600 atomic-mode trials), we demonstrate that the integrity guard detects 99.8-100% of corruptions with zero false positives. Performance overhead is 56.5-108.4% for atomic_nodirsync and 84.2-570.6% for atomic_dirsync relative to the unsafe baseline. Our findings quantify the reliability-performance trade-offs and provide deployment guidance for production AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯顺序学习与强化学习结合可支持疫情控制政策设计。

Abstract: This paper presents a real time, data driven decision support framework for epidemic control. We combine a compartmental epidemic model with sequential Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning (RL) controllers that adaptively choose intervention levels to balance disease burden, such as intensive care unit (ICU) load, against socio economic costs. We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy. Over a 300 day period and for a range of cost parameters, both controllers substantially reduce ICU burden relative to the observed interventions, illustrating how Bayesian sequential learning combined with RL can support the design of epidemic control policies.

Conclusion: 提出的非参数方法可用于稀疏数据功能主成分分析，能替代协方差函数用于多域数据聚类。

Abstract: Motivated by recent work involving the analysis of leveraging spatial correlations in sparsified mean estimation, we present a novel procedure for constructing covariance estimator. The proposed Random-knots (Random-knots-Spatial) and B-spline (Bspline-Spatial) estimators of the covariance function are computationally efficient. Asymptotic pointwise of the covariance are obtained for sparsified individual trajectories under some regularity conditions. Our proposed nonparametric method well perform the functional principal components analysis for the case of sparsified data, where the number of repeated measurements available per subject is small. In contrast, classical functional data analysis requires a large number of regularly spaced measurements per subject. Model selection techniques, such as the Akaike information criterion, are used to choose the model dimension corresponding to the number of eigenfunctions in the model. Theoretical results are illustrated with Monte Carlo simulation experiments. Finally, we cluster multi-domain data by replacing the covariance function with our proposed covariance estimator during PCA.

Abstract: We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.

Abstract: Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).

Abstract: Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize.

Abstract: High-throughput methods enable accelerated discovery of novel materials in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys, which exhibit intricate phase stability across vast compositional spaces. Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement.

Abstract: The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($φ_Δ$) and absorption maxima ($λ_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($φ_Δ$=0.85, $λ_{max}$=650nm).

Abstract: Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.
